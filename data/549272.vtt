00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I gyrraedd, roedd fy môr wedi cael ei ddod yn y ddwylo yna.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Mae'n fathr wedi'i gael i ddod yn y ddwylo ymchwil, roedd ei môr wedi'i gael i ddod i ffyrdd.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000

Roedd hi'n ei ddod yn y ddwylo yno.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Pan oedd hi'n ddod yna, yn y 12 mlynedd, dwi'n credu, roedd hi'n cael ei ddod yn y ddwylo.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Roedd y ddwylo yn cael eu gael i'r holl.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Mae'r holl yma yn Bristol.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Roedd fy mathr a'i môr, y 13 a 14 mlynedd, wedi'i cael eu gael ar y ddwylo.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Roedd eu môr yn y manegor o'r coleriad.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Roedd hi'n cael eu gael ar y ddwylo, a'i ddod yn y ddwylo a'i ddod yn ei gael ar ei ddwylo.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Roedd hynny'n y bach fy mathr.

Ond nid oes yn ffyrdd oherwydd ein fathr yn y ddwylo.

Rwy'n gwybod, o ran y ddwylo, roedd hi'n cael eu gael amlwg.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Roedd hi'n cael ei gael amlwg yn y 1926.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Roedd hi'n cael ei gael, yn ffordd, gyda fy mathr.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Roedd yn fawr, roeddwn i'n ffyrdd o fathr.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Roedd hi'n cael eu gael ar ei hunain, a wedi'i cael ddwy o ddwy o ddwylo,

Roedd fy mathr, yn y ddwylo, yn cael ei gael ar y ddwylo, pan oedd yn 43.

roedd yn ysgol y grama.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.160
Ac pan oeddwn yn 14,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160

Roeddwn yn cael y cyfnodau yno,

Roeddwn yn cael y gweithredu yn y gweithredu.

a allwn i ddweud,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160

Dydw i'r ddwy cyfnodau.

Yn oed hynny,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160

a, yn ogystal â bod yn ymwneud, dwi'n deall bod yn gweithio yn y ffactor, mae oedd y ffactor fwy.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.680
Felly roeddwn i'n mynd i weld, well, y ffrindio i mi, y gweithwyr yn gweithio yno a dweud,

Ond ei ddwy oedd yn ystod i mewn i'r ystod, ac roedd hi'n ddod yn y ffordd, felly byddwn i ddim wedi gweithio gyda'i.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.680
Yn ogystal â'r ddau'r ddau, roedd hi'n mynd i mi a allai i'n brydio i mi.

Felly roeddwn i'n gwneud ymlaen, pan oeddwn i'n cael ei ddwylo.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.680
Ond roeddwn i'n dweud, dyna ddwy oed.

Roeddwn i'n mynd ymlaen, oedd ymlaen,

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.080

roedd y chaerdyn, oherwydd roedd wedi gweithio yn y ffordd,

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.580
roeddwn i'n mynd i wneud rhywfaint o ddod yn ei gwaith.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.920
Roedd yn cael gwaith yn ei gwaith, oherwydd roedd y dydd yma,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.920

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.760
a dwi ddim yn gwybod y byddwn i'n cael gwas i'r sferi neu nid,

ond roeddwn i'n cael ei gwybnu yn y tab o'r Llywodraeth.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.960
Roeddwn i'n cael ei gwybnu.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.960
Roeddwn i'n gwybod ymlaen o hynny.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.280
A yna,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.480
roedd y chaerdyn yn cael ei gwybnu ac roeddwn i'n dweud,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.480
What are we going to do with you, man?

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.680
A roeddwn i dweud,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.180
roeddwn i dweud,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.680
Never mind,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.180
roeddwn i dweud,

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:48.680
I won't be here after eight.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.680
O, ry'n ni ddim yn gwybod,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.180
roeddwn i dweud,

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.680
Would you like to come back after Christmas?

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.180
A roeddwn i dweud,

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.680
Well, wouldn't mind.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.180
So, anyway,

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.680
the day before finished,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.180
and he came up to me,

00:08:59.180 --> 00:08:59.680
he said,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.680
We're starting back on such and such a date,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.680
if you want your job here, it's yours.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.680
So, I went back then, permanently.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.680
That would have been in about January 51.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.680
So, you started then as a kind of casual...

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.680
I started originally as a Christmas rush before Christmas,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.680
and then they asked me to come back then,

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.680
permanently after Christmas.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.680
Before you went to work there,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.680
did you know you were going to...

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.680
Did you realise you were going to enjoy it

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.680
as much as you did?

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.680
Well, I mean,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.680
as far as enjoying work of any sort,

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.680
nobody enjoys work,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.680
but I knew a couple of the ladies had worked there,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.680
and they said,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.680
Oh, it's a lovely atmosphere to work,

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.680
so I wasn't worried about going there.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.680
Did they give you any training at all?

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.680
Not really.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.680
No, no.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.680
I mean, prior to that,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.680
Lions had been doing war work,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.680
and it was very, very highly trained work.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.680
They made gliders and things like that,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.680
they were doing the war, yeah.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.680
But the work we were doing, it was only toys.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.680
It wasn't very skilled work.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.680
Can you describe to me then a working day?

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.680
What, you know, what was the work you did during the day?

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.680
When I went back,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.680
permanently then,

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.680
I stopped to think now.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.680
This is 65 years ago, isn't it?

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.680
No, 60 odd years anyway.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.680
Well, it was all a sin, you know,

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.680
even if you can remember as a little girl,

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.680
they used to have what they called nibbles or something,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.680
pushchairs.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.680
They were only like little support,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.680
you put dolls' pushchairs in,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.680
put dolls in, and you could fold them up and open them up.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.680
Well, we used to weld the joints of them,

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.680
and, well, I used to do the riveting and the joints,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.680
and that little girl working with them,

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.680
she used to do the welding.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.680
Yeah, it was simple work.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.680
And were you on a line?

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.680
Well, kind of a line, yes, yeah.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.680
You had to do a certain amount during the day.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.680
You were expected to do a certain amount.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.680
Do you remember what your wages were

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.680
when you started working there?

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:25.680
I know I was earning in the office about £2 odd a week,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.680
and when I went there, it was nearly double,

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.680
so I must have been earning about £4.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.680
And I mean, that was a lot of money

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.680
compared to what I'd been earning then, isn't it?

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.680
Would you say that was a lot of money in those days?

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.680
Well, not a lot, not a lot,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.680
but it was better than office work.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.680
I mean, everybody went into a factory

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.680
simply because you had more money than in an office.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.680
Yeah.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.680
Sorry.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.680
And then, of course, when I finished there,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.680
I was having my first little boy.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.680
Well, I did my work for quite a few years then.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.680
Well, then I started doing odd jobs two days a week

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.680
if I could have somebody to look after.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.680
I had a sister in the house to look after my little boy

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.680
so many days a week.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.680
Well, then I moved from Ylgerddig, Merthyrd,

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.680
down here to live then.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.680
Well, then the only jobs that were down here,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.680
I worked in the co-operative for a while.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.680
And I had a neighbour here,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.680
he was to keep an eye on him when he came home from school

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.680
and things like that.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.680
You had to do jobs in those days

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.680
that suited your family really.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.680
But going back to lines then,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.680
do you remember what you did used to do with your money?

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.680
How did you spend your money?

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.680
Well, mostly we'd had a little cottage.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.680
And all it was basically was four walls.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.680
So every pound we had spare, we spent on that house.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.680
Trying to make it a home then, innit?

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.680
And I always remember saying we'd just put a little bathroom,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.680
built a bathroom, put hot water in.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.680
And I said, I'm never ever going to move from here

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.680
unless I get hot water.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.680
Well, in the meantime, the lady that lived here

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.680
was my father's aunt.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.680
And her daughter offered us the house.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.680
And of course, my husband said,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.680
oh, it's a lovely house, man, you can do something with that.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.680
And of course, by then I had two children.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.680
We needed a bigger house.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.680
So anyway, we came down here, no hot water, no electric.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.680
We had to start from scratch again.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.680
And my husband would say,

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.680
I'd like to do this, I'd like to do that.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.680
I said, well, I do.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.680
What if I make a mess of it, Marge?

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.680
We'd scrap it and we'd start again.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.680
And whatever job he did, I was working with him.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.680
If he was mixing cement, I was mixing cement.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.680
Or I was mixing it and he was using it.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.680
We mixed, I don't know how many tonnes of cement

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.680
up in our first home up there.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.680
And then we sold it and moved down here.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.680
So that's your answer.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.680
We spent it all on our own,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.680
trying to get a little home together.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.680
Can you tell me some other things then?

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.680
What were your first impressions of the factory?

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.680
Well, I mean, up until then I'd never been inside a factory.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.680
And as I said, my first impressions were just noisy.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.680
I knew that after a day or so.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.680
How many of you worked there?

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.680
Oh, now I don't know.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.680
There was hundreds working there altogether

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.680
in the different departments.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:02.680
I was lucky I had a good charge on that little girl's brother.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.680
From the first time he knew me,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.680
I think he remembered my husband as a young boy going to school.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.680
And as soon as he knew I was pregnant,

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.680
he did a little job, what we'd call a cushy little job.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.680
As long as I did my work, and he was good to me, very good to me.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.680
Did you have to wear a kind of overall oen?

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.680
Oh, yeah, we had to wear, well, you could see in the photo,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:33.680
leather, over our overalls.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.680
But we didn't worry.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.680
We came home and we had a good wash and that was it.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.680
Were those supplied by the company?

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.680
The overalls were.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.680
The airplanes were, but not the overalls.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.680
We provided our own overalls.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:59.680
And how many of you who worked there were women?

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.680
Was it mainly women?

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.680
I would say 50-50.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:14.680
And I can always remember once I was put on a job,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.680
and I thought, this is easy, going hell for leather, as you say.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.680
And one of the men came up to me and said, take it easy.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.680
I said, what do you mean? Take it easy?

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.680
Well, of course they had time and motion to study for all these jobs.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.680
And you had to do a certain job.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.680
Well, I was going far higher than what I was expected to.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.680
So you're spoiling that job for the men, he said.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.680
It just didn't make sense to me in those days,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.680
because I thought, well, if I do my job, perhaps I'll have a bonus,

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.680
which I did have, innit?

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.680
But they were telling me to go slow because I was spoiling the rate for men.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.680
And I was a woman.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.680
Were you paid the same as the men?

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.680
Oh, no, no, you didn't have the same rate as the men.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.680
But you were doing the same work as the men?

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.680
Yeah, yeah.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.680
Do you know what the men were paid?

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.680
Oh, I haven't got a clue, love, I can't remember.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.680
I can't even remember what I was having by the time I got finished there.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:20.680
I mean, when you look back, the value of money has gone.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.680
It's exploded since then.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.680
Are you thinking of it now, when I first had a house of my own,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.680
a loaf of bread was four pence, old pence.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.680
And that was delivered to the door for four pence.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.680
You know, looking at the price of things today,

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.680
and when we tell the answers what we pay, they don't believe us.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.680
I mean, they don't believe that we could have lived on five pound a week,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.680
but we had to.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.680
I was paying a pound a week rent,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.680
and I had five pounds to live on,

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.680
so you can imagine you didn't have a lot to play around with.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.680
How did you get to work every day?

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.680
Well, when I lived in Yorgerig, I was catching a bus from where I lived,

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.680
down to the village.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.680
No, I walked from where I lived, about half a mile down to the village,

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.680
and caught a bus from there down to Lines.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.680
And was that public transport?

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.680
Yes.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.680
So you had to pay for that?

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.680
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.680
And when did you have to go to work in the morning, do you remember?

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.680
I had to start work at eight o'clock,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.680
so I was catching a bus up in the village about twenty past seven,

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.680
so I had to leave the house at seven o'clock.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.680
Did you clock in then?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.680
Yes.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.680
And what about breaks during the day?

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.680
Do you remember what your breaks were?

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.680
Well, we had breaks, yeah, ten minute breaks.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.680
In the morning and the afternoon?

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.680
Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.680
Do you remember how long you had for lunch?

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.680
Probably three-quarters of an hour, or an hour I'm not sure I'll have.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.680
Let's go back to work.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.680
And when did you finish the day then, if you started at eight?

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.680
At quarter past four.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.680
That was our finishing time.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.680
That was quite a good day then?

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.680
Good long day, yes.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.680
What about...

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.680
I wanted to ask you, so what was the relationship,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.680
the working and between you and the men?

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.680
Did you get on with the men?

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.680
Yes, yes, very well, yeah.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.680
How did you feel though about the fact that you were told?

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.680
I'll tell you one little story.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.680
Of course, by the time I was told,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.680
I'd tell you one little story.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.680
Of course, by the time I'd finished, I was very short.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.680
Of course, by the time I finished, I was quite a little tub.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.680
And the men used to shout after when they did,

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.680
here she comes, Mrs Five by Five, five foot high and five foot wide.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.680
That was a way of teasing me.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.680
But they were very good to me, yeah, I've got to say that.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.680
Did you feel resentful that they earned more money than you,

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.680
although you knew you were doing the same?

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.680
We didn't know any difference in those days, did we?

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.680
No, we didn't know any difference.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.680
How about unions in the factory then? Was it unionized then?

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.680
Well, I wasn't in an union.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.680
I mean, I wasn't there long enough really.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.680
I don't think I joined an union when I was there

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.680
because I knew I wasn't going to be there for a while.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.680
Well, then over the years I worked in offices

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.680
and if I was ill, I was paid.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.680
So I only paid what they called a married woman stamp, a basic stamp.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.680
And I worked then until I was 49.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.680
I worked in a garage in Merthyr.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.680
I was in the stores, in the office, in the stores.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.680
And they were talking about taking the garage down.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.680
They did take it down eventually.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.680
Of course, everybody was looking for a job.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.680
And then a friend of mine who worked in High Tat...

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.680
well, GC it was then.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.680
She said, when are you going to come and work in the factory with us?

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.680
Oh, I don't know, I said.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.680
I ammed and hired and then I did go.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.680
And then I thought, well, if I'm going to work in the factory now,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.680
I'm not going to be paid if I'm ill.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:27.680
So I paid the full stamp then and I joined the union then when I was 49.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.680
Okay, okay.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680
We'll come back to that.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.680
But do you remember then you weren't in the union in Lyons?

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.680
Was it Triang then or was it Lyons?

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.680
Or does it matter?

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.680
It was the same...

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.680
Well, it was the same.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.680
People were working there, different firms took over.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:53.680
I think Lyons was the wartime name for the factory.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.680
And then Triang was the...

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.680
Well, they made prams as well, as well as toys.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.680
They made full-size prams and toys, yeah.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.680
But you only worked on the toys, did you?

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.680
Yes, yeah.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:13.680
Right, you weren't a member, but do you remember any disputes, problems, strikes, anything like that?

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.680
No, not while I was there, no.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.680
So it was a really happy...

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.680
Yes, yes, it was quite a good factory.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.680
What about your relationship with the other women?

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.680
Can you describe that to me?

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.680
Well, I got on all right with everybody.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.680
Did you go out with them?

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.680
No, I was a married woman then, wasn't I?

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.680
So you never went out with them?

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.680
Married women didn't go out on their own in those days.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.680
They only went out with their husbands.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.680
And that wasn't very often.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.680
Right, right.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.680
What about Christmas parties or anything like that though?

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.680
Was anything like that going, you know, did Triang put on?

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.680
Well, as I say, I was only there just before one Christmas.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.680
And then I worked a few months into the following year.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.680
So I wasn't really there the second Christmas.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.680
Oh, I see.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.680
And you didn't have a... yeah, okay.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.680
Do you think the work was dangerous in any way?

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.680
Well, I mean, there were some jobs.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.680
I even went to work on them.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.680
They had guards on them.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.680
They did have guards on them, so they could have been dangerous.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.680
If they didn't have the guards on them.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.680
They were quite a safe factory, I think.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.680
Were you made aware of health and safety?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.680
Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.680
Were there any accidents were you aware of?

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.680
I don't remember anybody having an accident, no.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.680
Can you remember any of the rules and regulations?

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.680
Not really.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.680
What about the facilities in the factory?

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.680
Was the factory heated? Was it lit?

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.680
Oh, yes, yes, yeah, yeah.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.680
What about other facilities?

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.680
Well, we had toilets.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.680
There were other wrong toilets.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.680
I can't remember what we used to do for lunch.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.680
You don't remember if there was a canteen on them?

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.680
Yeah, I think there was a canteen there.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.680
We didn't go there for breaks, but we went there for lunch.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.680
That's right, yeah.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.680
What did you do during breaks then?

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.680
We usually took something, went to a toilet,

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.680
and had a cup of tea there, you know.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.680
But going back now, this is six-odd years.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:45.680
Things are not really as cut and dried as I'd like to tell you they were.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:51.680
You remember, it does go a little bit easy after six-odd years.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.680
Yes, no, you're doing really well.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:07.680
Now, I know you weren't there very long, but how many days did you work a week?

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.680
I worked full time.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.680
So it was five days a week?

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.680
Was there any weekend work?

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.680
No, no.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.680
Or shift work?

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.680
Not women, anyway.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.680
I never did shift work.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:28.680
Did the factory, did it shut on the weekend, do you think, or you don't remember?

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:39.680
I should imagine some of the men worked on the weekend, you know, to get overtime.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.680
I never worked anyway, just the five days.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.680
So you never did overtime or anything like that?

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.680
No, no, no.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.680
So you were allowed to talk while you worked?

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.680
Oh, yes, yes.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.680
And you said you sang when you worked?

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.680
Yes, we'd sing sometimes.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.680
Did they put records on?

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.680
No, not really.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.680
It was too noisy to put records on, you know.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.680
So it was just somebody in the factory standing?

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.680
Yes, sitting alongside you, yes.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.680
Do you remember what you sang?

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.680
A lot of different songs in those days.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.680
Do you remember anything?

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.680
No.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.680
I mean most of the songs then were all wartime songs, you know, that we picked up during the war.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.680
No, I can't remember what songs they were.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:31.680
But I will tell you that every song I learned, I still can sing, all the words.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.680
You don't forget songs, do you?

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680
No.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.680
What we learned when we were young.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.680
But I mean the songs that come out today, there's no words for them, is there?

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.680
No.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.680
So were they like Gracie Field songs or Vera Lynn songs, that kind of thing?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.680
Probably, yes.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.680
Because it wasn't long after the war, like, was it?

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.680
No.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.680
It was only a couple of years.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.680
Did you have any holidays while you were there?

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.680
Do you remember?

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.680
Well, I worked until the holidays.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.680
That was in the July.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.680
I started there after the Christmas and I worked there until the July full time.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.680
And I finished then.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:27.680
Well, of course, in those days you were entitled to six weeks' wages prior to having a baby and six weeks afterwards.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.680
Well, of course, it was more than six weeks to go.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.680
And I can remember going up to the door and signing on the door.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.680
The first week she tried to send me over to Rickers and I said, I can't get transport over there.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.680
That was it.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.680
So the second time I went up she said, what is your trouble?

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.680
Are you pregnant?

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.680
I said, it's not trouble, I said, but I'm pregnant, yes.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.680
Well, you don't want a job, do you?

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.680
Well, I said, I said, I've got until November to go, I said.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.680
I said, three months' work is better than nothing, I said.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.680
Or three months' toll, I said, I don't mind.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.680
And she said, oh, I'd fill it in.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:09.680
So I had six weeks' toll before I went on the sick then.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.680
Why did you leave Lyons then?

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:23.680
Well, I mean, I was getting quite big then, you know, and by the time the fortnight holidays would have been over, I was just about ready to give up work then.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.680
I mean, you can't do factory work when you're very heavily pregnant.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.680
No, I was just wondering, because you said you worked up to the holidays.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.680
Up to the holidays, yes.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.680
But you were still looking for work.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.680
Well, I didn't really want work.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:45.680
I just wanted a couple of weeks grace until I had my pregnancy money, maternity money, rather.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.680
Right.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.680
Right.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:29:02.680
My, you know, there were girls going up to the door then with babies in prams and signing on for years after they'd had the baby, and they got away with it.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.680
I just didn't have the cheek to do it.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:17.680
Were you aware of having bank holidays with pay while you were there?

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.680
Well, I had my holiday pay because I was finishing then, you see.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.680
So you think you would have had paid bank holidays?

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:37.680
Yes, they were having bank holiday pay then, yes.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:44.680
What was the attitude, do you think, of the factory to women who had children?

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.680
Could you have gone back to work there with children if you wanted to?

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.680
Oh, yes, if you want somebody to look after your children for you, yes.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.680
No reason why you couldn't.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.680
I mean, there were girls working with me then that had children, yes.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:03.680
I mean, probably living next door to their parents or sisters or whatever, yes.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.680
So that was perfectly okay in the factory.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.680
Yes, oh, yes.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.680
Did they have any kind of childcare facilities?

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.680
No, no, no.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.680
No such thing in those days, no.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:19.680
So what was the age of the women working there? Did they go from very young to...?

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:25.680
Well, my best friend worked until she was 60, all her life in the factory because she never had children.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:33.680
So that was the range. And she had a sister-in-law who lived with her and she worked in the factory until she was 60.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.680
And that was in Triang?

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.680
Yes, yes.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.680
Are you still in touch with some of the people who worked there?

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.680
They're all dead, love.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.680
I mean, even some of the girls that were living here, a lot younger than me, they've all died.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.680
I'm past myself, I'd put it that way.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.680
I don't think so.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.680
How did you feel about the time you worked in Triang? Tell me how you felt about it.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.680
I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.680
What did you enjoy most about it, do you think?

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.680
Well, you know, with an office job you've got to keep on going and I don't know what it is.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.680
It's just a different attitude, a different atmosphere to office work.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.680
Was that the people you worked with, you think?

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.680
No, no, no. It was just a different kind of work.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:35.680
And I mean, over the years I went to other offices, I worked in different shops.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.680
You had to do all sorts of jobs to suit your family then.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.680
You know, when you want somebody to look after the children, right, you took a job.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:51.680
So you told me after having your children and a bit later on you went back to a factory.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.680
Could you tell me about that?

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.680
Well, at the time of the disaster I was working in a co-op locally.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:07.680
Well, then I tried to get a job in the co-op part time,

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:13.680
but the management that I had down here, he didn't want part time as he wanted full time.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:22.680
In the meantime I got a job then in an office, a garage in Merthyr, in the store's office.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:35.680
I worked there for many years and I only left there to live, to work in a high taxi because they were going to pull the factory down.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:40.680
There was a culvert running under it and they were talking about taking it down.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:47.680
Everybody was looking for a job from there, but I worked there quite a few years, but it was all part time.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.680
What factory was this now?

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:59.680
No, it was a garage. Howells garage in Merthyr and I worked in the store's office there.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:08.680
As I said, I had no intentions of ever leaving. I was only doing part time work because my son was working and things.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:15.680
Of course then everybody was looking for jobs because we knew the garage was coming down

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:20.680
and that's why I went to work back then full time in High Tatchy.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.680
What was it when you started working there?

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:33.680
GC, in Merthyr it was. Eventually High Tatchy took over half of it.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:43.680
Then they transferred us from Merthyr then over to Hirawayn and then High Tatchy took it over all then.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.680
I've got to say they were quite a good firm to work for.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:55.680
What was the difference between when you worked for GC in Merthyr and when you worked for High Tatchy in Hirawayn?

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:02.680
It was a different kind of factory to start with. It was a cleaner factory. High Tatchy was spotlessly cleaned.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:10.680
Other than that, you still had to do your job, you still had to do your number every day.

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:17.680
How did you get to Hirawayn to work?

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:25.680
We had a bus. First of all we had a bus coming around here, then they stopped that.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.680
We had to go from here up to the next village to catch it. Then we had a bus all the way over.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.680
But eventually I started using my car. I had a car then.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:42.680
Last go off we didn't have a bus. In fact the lady that used to take us to work to start with,

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:50.680
my mother lived over there and she was a widow. She used to come down here and pick the two of us up here.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:56.680
She picked another one up then in Merthyr. She used to take about four of us to work every day.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.680
Margaret, she was a lovely person, a quiet woman.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:13.680
She took us now and then when the holidays came, she took her mother, picked her mother up and took her to Ponty in Merthyr.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.680
They crashed down in Eddwardsville and she got killed.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:23.680
I had to take my car to work. There was no other way of getting there.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.680
So for the last year or two I took my car to work then.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:36.680
I mean at the time my husband was working in Hoovers and he was on shift so he managed with the one car then.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.680
Can you describe what GEC was like to work in Merthyr?

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.680
Yes, quite a good factory.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.680
What did you make?

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:58.680
Well, in Merthyr, when they started off in Merthyr, they were only making what they called the boards.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:04.680
You put all the circuit boards.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:14.680
And my job was cutting the little wires off the back, making sure there were no blind ants soldering them and then they'd be passed over.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:22.680
Well, I did that for a couple of years because when we went over to Hirwine, they were making the complete sets over there.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:30.680
And although I went to work on the circuit board to start with, I went on other jobs after and they were all nice clean jobs.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:36.680
Did you have a uniform to work in both places?

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.680
Yes, I got one with me and an uniform I think.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.680
So did they provide the uniform for you?

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:52.680
Yes, we didn't pay for the uniform.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:37:00.680
Can you remember again your first day at work when you went to GEC? What was it like?

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:08.680
Well, the first time I went to GEC it was so different from anything I'd done for many, many years.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:16.680
Whatever it was, it was strange, but you know, you get used to things after a day or two don't you?

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.680
What year was that then?

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:32.680
I was 49, so 28. 38, 48, 58, 68, 70, 77 was it?

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:38.680
Yes, in 1967 I went over there. I was 49 when I went there, see, that's how I know.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:44.680
And I joined the union then and started paying a full stamp then because up until then I'd been paid whatever.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:50.680
If I was out sick I was always paid in the office.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.680
Is that why you joined the union?

00:37:52.680 --> 00:38:00.680
Yes, yes. I never belonged to one before. Well, if you're in small firms you didn't.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:06.680
Was it mainly a women workforce in GEC?

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:12.680
I would say mainly, but there were still a lot of men there, yes.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.680
Again, did you do the same kind of jobs?

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:24.680
The men were mostly the foremen and the chargers and we had quite a few young Japanese trainees there, you know.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.680
We used to send them over here to be trained and then they'd send them back home.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.680
In GEC now?

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.680
No, in Itachi.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.680
Oh right, okay, yes.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.680
In Itachi.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:42.680
And I've got to say this, they got on well with the Welsh boys that they were working with.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.680
The Japanese?

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.680
The Japanese boys, they were very, very sociable boys.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:56.680
And I say this now, you know, get friendly with the local boys and the boys would take them out for a drink in the night.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:02.680
But once the Japanese found out they were going out for a drink, they were sent back home.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.680
That was frowned upon.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:16.680
But you went there when you were a bit older. How long were you in GEC before you went to Itachi, before you became Itachi men?

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:24.680
Oh, about forty, forty-nine.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:30.680
Well, quite a couple of years before we were taken over by Itachi, yes.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.680
I can't remember how many.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.680
Did you have to train for this job, the GEC job?

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.680
No, not really.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.680
You just picked it up?

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.680
Yes.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:54.680
And what was he, so can you remember how much you were paid then a week when you started now in GEC in Merthyr?

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.680
I don't remember.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.680
But perhaps two or three years ago I would have told you.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.680
I know when I, it was nearly double.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:16.680
I went to, no, wait a minute now, I went to work full time and I was having double what I was having part time.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:22.680
More than double, so I was, you know, I felt quite well off when I went there.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:26.680
Do you remember what you had in Itachi then when you went there?

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.680
No, I mean over the years it was going up and up and up, you know.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.680
But there wasn't a leap up or anything?

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.680
No, no, not really.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.680
It was a kind of gradual?

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.680
Yes.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.680
But it went up every year then?

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.680
Well, like everybody else's isn't it, it goes up every year.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:51.680
The only thing is we did have to pay our own bus fare over to Hirwaen. We had to provide our own transport.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.680
Oh, did you?

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.680
Yes, yes.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.680
Was that expensive?

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:05.680
Well, having a special bus, it wasn't too bad, you know, but I mean I can't remember now what we paid.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.680
So it was a special bus put on by Itachi?

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.680
Oh, no, no, no.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.680
Oh, I see.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:20.680
It was worked out for, well, whoever was using it before I started and it was a local bus anyway that started down the valley and picked us up.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.680
And then picked us up in Merthyrn and then took us over.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:27.680
Were there other industries over in Hirwaen that had Itachi?

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.680
Oh, yes, quite a lot, yes.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.680
So there was a lot of you going by bus over there?

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:40.680
Most of the ones on our bus were going to Itachi, but we did have an odd one or two working in other factories there, yes.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:49.680
And you joined the union when you entered GC. Do you remember which union it was?

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:06.680
I think we had a, I don't think there was much of a choice. It was something to do with electrical works here.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.680
I can't remember the name of it, no.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:16.680
Did you feel the workers were fairly treated there in GC?

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.680
I think so, yes, yes.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.680
And what about Itachi afterwards?

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.680
Yes, yes, yes.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.680
Did they accept the union when you went over there?

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:34.680
No, then. Well, the Japs, I think, were compelled to accept the union because the union was going before they got there.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:42.680
But as I told you, when they first came and took over, they said, too many whiteheads here.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.680
They meant grey-haired women.

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:52.680
But of course, you know, youngsters, they go down the toilet, they have a cigarette, they're down there ten minutes, quarter of an hour.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:59.680
If we went to the toilet, we were back in two minutes. And whether they noticed that or what, we don't know.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:08.680
So after a couple of months, they said they would like to withdraw their statement, whiteheads work well.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.680
That's what we have.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.680
Did your experience pay off as well, do you think? You know, just life experience?

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.680
Well, I think so, too, yes.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.680
Do you think the older women were quite quick at work?

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:30.680
It isn't that we were quicker than the young ones, but we stuck at it.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.680
We didn't go out the toilet back and forth all day like the youngsters.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:39.680
I mean, the youngsters were very smart and, you know, quick, doing their job.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:47.680
What were the conditions like in First GC and then Itashi?

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.680
Would you say it was a good working environment?

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.680
On the whole, yes, I think.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:02.680
Only one thing I can remember, when we were in Merthyn, I think it was,

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:10.680
and you know, the printed circuit board comes up and it goes over a solder bath

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:15.680
and then the woman takes them off and puts them in a bin

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.680
and then we take them from there and do it.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.680
Well, this particular day, I said to her, Gwen,

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.680
there's something falling down on me all the time, she said.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.680
And all of a sudden, they were maggots.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:37.680
Evidently, a pigeon or whatever had been up there

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.680
and the fumes from the solder bath must have killed it.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:45.680
And it had died there and it had gone rotten

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.680
and they had just covered them.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.680
They had to go up to have a look, the men had to go up

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:56.680
and there was a pigeon up there full of maggots and falling on her as she was working.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:01.680
Of course, they could kill it, that would have been smartish, yes.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.680
What's a solder bath? Can you explain that to me?

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:13.680
It's a bath of boiling solder and the circuit boards,

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:23.680
they would come up on a track and it would just about fit over it like that

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:29.680
and it would go round like that and then she'd pick them off as they were coming off then.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:34.680
What it meant was the little feet of all the, what girl,

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.680
were just touching the solder bath.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:43.680
And then of course, once it had gone past, the solder bath was still there boiling all day.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.680
It was a hot job, that was, but she never complained.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.680
Was it usually women who did that job?

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.680
Yes, yes.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.680
So you did the kind of, did the women usually do the kind of micro?

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:04.680
When I was working, I worked with a screen.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:09.680
You couldn't see the little pin on the, what they call dry joints.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.680
As it went over the solder, perhaps there would be a bubble or something

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.680
and it would burst and you'd have a dry joint.

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:21.680
And they had to be re-solidated before it would go any further then.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.680
Was that hard on your eyes?

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.680
Well, not because we had it like a frame and we used to put it behind there,

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:30.680
we used to work with it under a frame, yeah.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.680
My eyesight was pretty good.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.680
Was the work dangerous in any way?

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:42.680
Well, having boiling solder, it could have been I suppose,

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:48.680
but we didn't regard it as dangerous at all, no.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.680
Were you made aware of health and safety once again?

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.680
Well, I suppose that whoever arranged all this,

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.680
they were aware of the health and the safety of the staff.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:04.680
I can't remember anything happening that was dangerous anyway, no.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.680
Except the poor old pigeon.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.680
Except the poor old pigeon up atop.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:17.680
Did they have time in motion in those days as well?

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:18.680
Oh yes, yes.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.680
You had a certain amount to do, yeah.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:27.680
And I tell you what they did do, they used to pay us a bonus.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.680
If we were early every day.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.680
Now, there was no fault of ours if we were late.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.680
It would be the bus at fault,

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:43.680
but we still had to be there early every day to get this one bonus, yeah.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.680
Do you remember how much that was?

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.680
No.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.680
A couple of bobics.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.680
What were the facilities like in GZ and then in Hitachi, you know?

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.680
We had a nurse, yeah.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.680
We had a nurse in the both places.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.680
Toilets?

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.680
Oh yes, lovely toilets, clean toilets.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.680
And what about a canteen?

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.680
And a lovely canteen, yeah.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.680
In both places?

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.680
Yes, yeah.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.680
Would you say Hitachi was?

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.680
Hitachi had a very good canteen there, yes.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.680
Would you say you had better facilities in Hitachi?

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.680
I think so, yes, yeah.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:29.680
How was the relationship between the workers and the management of Hitachi?

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:38.680
Well, I mean, the Japanese management, we had little to do with them.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.680
We didn't have any conversation with them at all.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:45.680
It was all done through our foremen and our charge-hands.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.680
But they seemed to get on well.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:52.680
They used to have meetings and all this and that and sort things out, yeah.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.680
Would you say they were good employers?

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.680
Well, I thought so, yeah.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.680
And fair?

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:03.680
Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:08.680
Were people allowed to talk while they worked?

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:16.680
Well, you could talk, but I mean, you had to concentrate more on that job than what we did in lines.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.680
What about smoking and things like that?

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.680
Well, you weren't allowed to smoke.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:25.680
You had to go outside to smoke, to the toilet to smoke.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.680
That didn't matter to me at all.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.680
Do you think you've suffered any long-term health effects from working from any other factories?

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.680
No.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:45.680
What was the relationship again between the women and the men in, first of all, GC and then Hitachi?

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:49.680
Was that a good relationship?

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:56.680
Well, most of the men did different types of work in Hitachi to start with.

00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:00.680
It was more skilled, what the men were doing.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.680
I mean, they were working on television.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.680
Mine was different to just a board they were working on.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.680
They were working on televisions, the men were.

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.680
Did they earn a lot more money than you?

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.680
Oh, I should imagine so, yes.

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.680
But you weren't aware of what they earned?

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:21.680
No.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:27.680
When you worked, you said you were married twice.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.680
How did your husband's, different husband's...

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.680
Well, my second husband, I didn't get married to until I was 70.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.680
That was years later, that was.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:43.680
What was the reaction of your husband to the fact that you worked?

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.680
Was he all right with that?

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.680
He profited as well as me, didn't he?

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.680
But he was supportive, was he?

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.680
Oh, yes, he didn't make me go back to work, no.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:51:00.680
Well, in those days he knew very well if you didn't go back to work, you were living, you know, existing.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.680
Not living.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.680
If you wanted any extras out of your life, you had to go to work.

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.680
And you went back to work full time, didn't you?

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:13.680
So did he help more with the domestic work at home?

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:18.680
If you asked him to make anything, you could guarantee there'd be a tin of beans in it.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.680
No, he wasn't a very good cook, I'm afraid.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:29.680
But, I mean, as far as anything else goes on the house, anything that's been done to this house, my first husband did it.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.680
Yeah.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.680
What about...

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.680
He was a good do-it-yourself man.

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:35.680
Was he?

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.680
Yeah.

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:43.680
How many days a week did you work in GEC and Hitachi?

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.680
Full time.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.680
So five days a week?

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.680
Yes, yeah.

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.680
Was there any overtime or shift work?

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.680
No, no, no. Not for women, anyway.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.680
Do you remember what your hours were, again?

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.680
What a beauty.

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:10.680
I think we used to start at eight o'clock when we were in lines and finish about quarter past four.

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:18.680
But when we worked in Hitachi, we used to be over there by eight.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.680
We had to be there by eight.

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.680
And I think we worked until about four.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.680
So longer hours?

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.680
I think so. I can't remember exactly now.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.680
Do you remember your breaks or anything?

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.680
We had breaks, that's all I know.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.680
Yes, yes.

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:46.680
Do you remember what the canteen was like? Was it good food?

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.680
Oh, Hitachi was excellent. It was like a restaurant.

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.680
Was it?

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:51.680
Yeah, yeah.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.680
And did you used to eat there?

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.680
Yes, yes. We ate there every day.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.680
And subsidised food?

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.680
Well, I suppose you must have been, yeah.

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.680
Was it cheap, was it?

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.680
Well, it wasn't cheap, but...

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680
Well, reasonable.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.680
Reasonable prices, yes.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.680
For what you were getting.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.680
Did you have an annual holiday allowance with pay?

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.680
Oh, yes.

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.680
And bank holidays?

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.680
Yes, yes.

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.680
How many days a year did you have for your holidays, do you remember?

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.680
Well, the usual. I would say Christmas day, Boxing day.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:32.680
And I think we'd have the rest of the week off, if I remember rightly.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:37.680
Well, then we'd have Easter Monday,

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:45.680
Witson Monday and Tuesday, if I remember rightly.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:51.680
August bank holiday, which is different now to what it used to be in there.

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.680
Yeah, we had regular holidays, yeah.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:02.680
What about summer holidays? Did you have one, two, three weeks off?

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:04.680
Fortnight holidays.

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.680
Fortnight holidays.

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:09.680
And did you have to take them... did the factory shut down?

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.680
Did the factory shut down?

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.680
No, that's what I can't remember.

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:20.680
I know when my husband was working in Overs, they had to take it at a certain time every year.

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:26.680
And I can't remember, at one time the miners were the same time.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:30.680
Then they altered, the miners were one week different from the factories.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.680
I can't remember whether...

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.680
I can't remember, because at that particular time we had a little touring caravan,

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.680
so we didn't have to go booking holidays.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.680
We went, you know, wherever we wanted to go.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.680
Where did you tend to go in your touring caravan?

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.680
Saundersford, Tenby, West Wales.

00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:05.680
We went up to Derbyshire once or twice, Scarborough,

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.680
but I couldn't get him to come abroad.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.680
South Coast, we went to Eastbourne a few times.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.680
We did quite a lot of travelling.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.680
And as soon as he died, I sold it.

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.680
Because my first husband died of cancer, I say.

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.680
And when did he die?

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.680
1991.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:37.680
Then I met my second... well, I'd met him because he was going into the Coastal Forces.

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.680
He was going into the British Army.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.680
He was going into the British Army.

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:49.680
I'd met him because he was going into the Coastal Forces Association we belonged to.

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.680
And his wife died.

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.680
My husband died in the March and his wife died in the February.

00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:02.680
Well, I had met them once down in Bridgend in a Christmas tour.

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.680
Well, then I started going back and forth to the...

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.680
We used to have monthly meetings.

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:12.680
And a friend of mine from Yn y Gereg, from Shirley Gardens,

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:17.680
these earners, said, don't stop coming to the club now, just because Randall have died.

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.680
You must come down. You can come down with us.

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.680
So, of course, I started going back and forth with them.

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.680
Well, you know how it is.

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:30.680
If we had any dues, all the odd ones were stuck together, so Glyn and I.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.680
That's my second.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.680
I was just going to ask, were you allowed days off for personal reasons, you know,

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.680
or did you have to lose a day's pay?

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.680
Oh, you'd have to lose a day's pay.

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:49.680
If you wanted to go to a funeral or something like that, yes, you'd have to lose a day's pay.

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:56.680
And I can't remember very well, but say it was a sister or a brother, somebody close,

00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:01.680
they might have paid us, but otherwise no, if I remember rightly.

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.680
What about social activities organised by the workers?

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.680
I know you were married, but you're a bit older.

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.680
Was there any kind of social?

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.680
No, I don't think they organised a social.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:23.680
I mean, everybody that worked in Aitachi then were from Merthyr, Aberfan, Aberday, all around the area,

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.680
so you could very well organise much then, could you?

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.680
They didn't have a Christmas party or a Christmas lunch?

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:32.680
Well, I think we had a Christmas lunch or something like that, you know.

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.680
In the canteen.

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.680
They decorated the canteen.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:42.680
They decorated the canteen and we had a special dinner like, but I wouldn't call them parties then, you know.

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:49.680
Did the factory have a social club? Any kind of social club?

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.680
No, I think they did.

00:57:54.680 --> 00:58:02.680
Mostly were the men, I think they were involved, you know, the, what I would have called the tradesmen,

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:07.680
the ones who were trained to do different things, I think they had sort of a club.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:12.680
These young men who came over from Japan, where did they live then, do you know?

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.680
Well, they lived in hotels and things locally.

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.680
Did they? Yeah.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:18.680
And were they training them for management?

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:20.680
Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:24.680
Did you have any people like that while you were there?

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:29.680
I mean, we never had contact, but they did have contact with the young boys working there.

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:30.680
Right.

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.680
Not with the women, no.

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:36.680
But they were quite polite, you know, they'd say hello, good morning and things, you know.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:37.680
Yeah.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:42.680
But they weren't allowed to mix too well with the young Welsh boys.

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:52.680
Did you enjoy working in Hitachi?

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:53.680
Yes, I did, yeah.

00:58:53.680 --> 00:59:00.680
Why do you think that is? Job satisfaction or was it a company or?

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:05.680
The point is, as I explained to you, if you didn't work, you didn't have any extras in life, did you?

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:13.680
So if you were working in a job that you enjoyed and the money was good, naturally you enjoyed it. Yeah.

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.680
When did you decide to leave?

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:27.680
I didn't decide to leave. About 12 months before I was 60, I had spondylitis and I couldn't raise my arms very well.

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:39.680
So I went on the sick for a while then and of course I finished when I was 60, but I was on the sick for 12 months before and with spondylitis.

00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:47.680
Because the job I had, I had to be holding my arms up and I couldn't do it. Up until then I'd had no problems.

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:57.680
Were you paid when you were on the sick, apart from statutory sick pay? Were you paid by the factory?

00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:02.680
No, I don't think so. No, we were on the NHS sick then, innit? No.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.680
How long did you work for in the factory?

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:13.680
I went to Hitachi when I was 49 and I worked until I was 59.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:20.680
Are you in contact with any former workmates from Hitachi?

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:30.680
Well, when I say contact, I say on Christmas cards, I've got a friend that used to live down here, she went to live up in the next village.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:43.680
If I see her in town, we have a chat and things, but I can't say we keep contact because she's got relatives and friends up there.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.680
But we still keep in touch then.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.680
But you don't go out with people? No.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:58.680
Looking back now, how do you feel about the time you worked in these factories you worked in?

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:07.680
Well, as far as I was concerned, it was all good for me. We got things that we couldn't have got otherwise.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:17.680
My husband was a fanatic about changing his car. So of course, when I worked, it was to change his car. My first husband that was.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.680
What about you? What did you get out of it?

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.680
Well, we had holidays and whatever I wanted in the house I had.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:37.680
I'm not always as old-fashioned as this because, as I say, my first husband's gone now 23 years. There's nothing been done since he's gone.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.680
That's great, Marge. Thank you very much.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.680
You're welcome, love, if I've been any use to you.
