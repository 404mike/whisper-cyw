If you're talking about how minors were treated by the police and that in the demonstrations,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:22.980
I think sometimes I'm not putting blame on either side because I've been in enough demonstrations

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.860
in my life and I've seen what goes on in the demonstrations when they got police on horseback

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:51.060
and I've watched from a distance how police have only done one little thing for the horse

00:00:51.060 --> 00:01:03.460
to rear up a bit and make you look as if something is happening. These things can happen on that

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.900
side. I have seen that happen. I have been right up by it because I always made sure I kept away

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:22.420
from anything else. But sometimes there's the overzealousness of the people on strike and the

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.660
overzealousness of the people trying to keep control of what goes on there because there is

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.540
a lot of pushing, there's a lot of shoving and what do you mean to get at places where they

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.140
shouldn't be? I don't condone that kind of behaviour.
