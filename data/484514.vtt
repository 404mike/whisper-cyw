Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.560
Interviewee David Goff-Eveley.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.600
The location is the Swicker office.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.320
And today's date is the 9th of October 2015.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.720
Goffy, as you're better known, could you do me a favour

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.560
and spell your name in full for the record, please?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.080
Well, Goffy is G-O-F-F-E-E,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:37.360
my other name, David Goff-Eveley, is D-A-V-I-D-G-O-F-F-E-V-E-L-E-I-G-H.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.560
Thank you very much.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.640
Goffy, as you're better known,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.200
can you recall your first point of contact with Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.480
Well, I was a Blue Devil in 2005

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.320
for the Cardiff Carnival, which was great fun.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.320
I remember colouring myself entirely in blue paint

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.040
and being very leery and with a shopping trolley

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.320
and it pour with rain and everything ran nicely.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.360
Even the streets running with blue.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.320
Blue blood, I think.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.920
No, great images come to mind.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.160
And then more recently, you've become involved again as a participant.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.760
And I believe in 2013, you actually played somebody,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.520
well, an iconic folkloric godlike figure

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.000
who's meant a lot to you in your work, the Green Man.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.840
Tell us a bit more about the Green Man and your Carnival experiences in 2013.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.080
Yes, I was a Green Man and, you know, a huge, great Green Man costume.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.400
Yes, Green Man is dear to my heart because I've built

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.800
the biggest image of the Green Man in the world,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.840
which is the Green Man maze at Penn Pond near Brecon.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.320
And, yeah, so he's, yeah, and that was great.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.040
Great. He's always hugely, huge fun doing anything with Swicker.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.720
And I'm so sorry to hear that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.320
they've they're they're being axed.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.720
It's the truth.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.800
Going back to when we first actually met,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.120
not in the context of the Cardiff Carnival, but in 1992,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.800
I became aware of this legendary figure out down on Hay on Wye,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.840
who was organizing fantastic fire based events called, very wittily, Hay on Fire.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.320
Tell us more about that event.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.000
I do recall, from my perspective, with Samba Galaise, the Cardiff School Samba,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.520
you beckoning me into a on the banks of the River Wye,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.840
there on Hay, into a beautiful labyrinth, which we promptly entered

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.480
until the point at which the audience, I thought they were applauding

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.800
and they were shouting for more music.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.600
What they're actually pointing out was that my trousers were on fire,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.800
at which point we moved in the other direction and came out of the.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.520
So it was a great and glorious meeting.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.720
I have I have bought new trousers since that point.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.920
Well, I think you've been you're shorter.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.480
You walk around on stumps.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.040
Yes. So Hay on Fire, I mean, yeah, where were you coming from?

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.280
Well, yeah, that's a huge party.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.480
I was became the biggest fire festival in Wales.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.400
And it was a huge, great community event.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.600
And we had we had Samba Galaise,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.800
Wicca dancers, all sort.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.800
We had and masses of theatre and wicked giants and burning labyrinths.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.400
And that year, I think we had

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.840
it was Arthur in Epic and we had King Arthur swinging on fiery trapeze,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.240
he's diving through fiery hoops, walking on fiery tight ropes.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.760
And yes, huge torchlight processions and

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.120
funeral barges coming down the river and even we had big shy horses

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:28.840
and all sorts of bands and a vast amount of fireworks and pyrotechnics.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.080
Of course, Swicka and yourself and indeed your very wittily named company,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.600
the Department of Enjoyment,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.120
had worked for six or seven years on winter based events,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.800
which was essentially a large scale

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.120
community participation project about making lanterns and parading them.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.240
But of course, you and I got to play

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.480
with that fabulous building and its grounds, Cuffili Castle.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.560
Can you tell me a bit about some about some of those memories?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.640
And equally specifically about fire sculptures.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.640
What are fire sculptures?

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.960
And they say they featured.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.360
This is something you brought to our body of work and integrated into what we were doing.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.440
Well, that's my speciality is doing giant fire sculptures

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:29.680
eight meters high and mainly iconic images like the green man and the Welsh dragon.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:40.320
I did sort of fighting dragons and angels and Botticelli's Venus, all sorts of things,

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.120
which a lot of those are all commissioned by Swicker in the past.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.320
And yeah, Cuffili Castle used to be a great gig.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.680
And we yeah, I think the highlight of Cuffili Castle was

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:06.960
when I thought I'd have I do the legend of the wicked Duke of the Castle, whatever he was.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.920
And so Gilbert de Clare, boo his and being we had we had

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.920
we had Norman Knight chasing dragons and that went from jumping off the tower and

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.920
what you call it?

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.920
I'm not paragliding.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.920
Jet skis.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.920
No, no, no.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.920
Absailing.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.920
Absailing down the towers and then we had jet skis.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.920
We had jet ski dragons and and medieval knights shooting around the the the

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:49.920
the moat, which was fantastic, given that the whole thing was a national monument.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:57.920
Yeah, I don't think they've ever seen anything like it in their life before or since before or since.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.920
And it was great fun.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:09.920
Yes. Well, certainly if I was handing out national cultural treasure awards, you know that I would have awarded one to you many years ago.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.920
And, you know, it's been a total joy working with you out of doors on a vast number of projects.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:27.920
We've mentioned some of them. We haven't even talked about Tempest on Fire, a circus theatre piece a couple of years ago in 2013, again at Penpoint Estate.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:45.920
But as we bring this brief conversation to a close, of course, we recently spent time in the beautiful North Walyan folly, as it were, folly village of Port Marion as Swicker brought its carnival to festival number six.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.920
How was that experience, particularly the carnival parade?

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.920
Well, the carnival, yes, it's a very colourful, beautiful setting, Port Marion.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:09.920
And I discovered I could multitask because I turned into an octopus with eight arms and I could I could attack eight children at the same time, which is great.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.920
A dream come true.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.920
Absolutely.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:21.920
Of course, as I say, all honour to your long and venerable history in terms of this.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.920
I see you very much as the godfather of outdoor arts in Wales.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.920
You're also one of our carnival heroes.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.920
So, Goffy, many thanks indeed.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.920
And, well, plenty more fun to be had.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.920
Well, I hope so.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:59.920
And, you know, I think working with Swicker has been a joy and I'm so I'm rarely upset that it's they haven't got the foresight to see how important community theatre is for the community and for Wales.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.920
You know, it's a great tragedy.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.920
Anyway, wish you all the best, Steve, and I'm sure you'll go and do great things.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.920
Thanks, Goffo.
