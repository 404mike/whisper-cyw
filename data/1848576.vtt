WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Okay, so today is the 3rd of July 2019, this is after I do the Dows. Can you say your full

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
name? My name is Derek Patrick Gale. And what are your parents' names? Well, my mother's

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.320
name is Gwendolyn and my stepfather, Ruben Murray, because he's not my real dad, because

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.320
I've never met my real dad, you know. Which is something none of my existing family has

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.240
ever spoken about, you know. So I've never been able to find out who he is or what he

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.320
did or, you know, some secrets. Big secrets, you know, black people like, you know, you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.000
don't get in conversation with them until you've been spoken to, you get me? So you

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
don't really know what's happening, you know. But, and I thought it was, but I didn't know

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.720
Ruben's family before I came to England. And I knew he wasn't my father, because that much

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.720
I knew, you know. So when I came here, I knew I was going to a house with my mother and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.760
my stepfather, you know, but I didn't know how the reaction would be. But it was good

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.840
in terms of living, you know. There wasn't any animosity between either of us, you know.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.840
My mother was more like, more dominant of the two, you know. So she, she was like, I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.280
came here, but, you know, I look at it and I thought to myself, over the years and see

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.800
the years gone by, I was here to look after the younger ones more, you know, more than

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.440
actually looking after myself, you know what I mean. I was fed and I was clothed, stuff

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.440
like that. But other than that is do around the house, which, you know, when they're not

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.920
there, you know, make sure the kids are safe. So I've been doing safety work for quite a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.720
long time, you know what I'm saying. So, you know, five kids, you know. But back home,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.160
as a kid, we grew up with a large amount of young people, you know, because if I remember

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.160
rightly, I was counting the other day, my auntie in London, she had five children. My

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.280
one auntie, she had two. My other auntie, you know, it was like ten of us in the one

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.160
yard, you know what I mean. There used to be a gale yard. That's why the word yardie

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.480
comes about, you know, because everybody live in a yard. Because my grandfather, he owns

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.480
this property. So that was a gale yard. And further down the road, there was a property

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.480
which is called Clark's. And the fact that it was called a Clark yard is because they

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.880
were all relatives, but there was only one owner. He owns it and everybody built a house

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.160
on it, you know, family, a little house there, a little house there. And it's called Clark

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.160
yard. It actually was called James yard, because they were all James, the whole caboodle

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.320
of them, you know. So, you know, so kids were like close proximity when you're growing up,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.440
you know what I mean. Uncles around you, you know what I mean. You have, like I was showing

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.280
you, I've got three uncles, you know. We were at similar age, you know, older than me, but

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.200
they were doing things which I was able to do as well, you know. So it was a happy medium

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.200
back home, you know. I had a fantastic time as a kid, you know, because we lived out in

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.800
the bush, you know what I mean. We had, my grandfather, he had goats, you know, he was

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.520
a farmer, he planted rice. I mean, he did everything, you know what I'm saying. He was

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.680
like, you know, and the most important thing, right, Premento, right. I don't know if you

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.400
know what Premento is, right. Premento, that part where we came from, Premento was the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.920
main growth of stuff, right. And when the Premento season comes around, everybody has

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.400
to chip in, you know. We are the youngest boys, we are the one that climbs the trees

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.520
and breaks the limb down, and you've got some of them down there with a bag, because the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.720
seeds, right, the seeds is the most important thing, right. And Premento season is like

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.080
a hard working time, right, because it's got to be dried, it's got to be picked, you know.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.240
We used to have a little room at the back of the house, we used to have all the, we used to call them

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.200
crock-ass bags, and we used to fill it up with Premento, take it out, and in the night,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.160
all the women and the neighbours come and we sit there and they're picking Premento

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.520
in the night, and we're talking dopey stories, you know. It'll be like, cool story going

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.120
on, you know. And if you have to get up and walk back to your house, it's pitch black,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.600
you know what I mean. The living day life, you know what I'm saying, it's ridiculous,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.040
but it was fun, you know. I didn't have to just go, and my granny used to say, you wash

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.640
your foot, you know, we had a top running into the yard just off the road, and the foot

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.520
pad leaves up there, and she used to come with the torch and say, go wash your foot,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.840
and you know what I mean. So we had to run up in the dark to the top and you wet your

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.200
foot and run back, you know what I mean. I used to go, dopey! And those are the things

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:42.200
I remember back home, you know what I mean. We used to have goats, and like I said, we

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.440
get up early in the morning and goats gotta go out, right. And we had a property, we used

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.440
to call it hilltop, it's like that. But when you get to the top, it's a pure level, you

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.600
know. But the goats, they know the way up and down. We used to have one called Billy,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.600
because he's a ram goat, you know. We used to call him Billy, tie a thing around his

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.600
neck, and he takes a plaque up to the hill. And this is before we got to school, you know

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.840
what I mean. And we used to go to a school called Petersfield, which is like from here

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.360
to Grangetown, probably further. But we used to walk, but we never used to walk by the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.280
roads. We used to walk in between properties. We know there's footpath leading, you know,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.240
so you come across mango trees, there's nisberry trees, there's squabber trees. So you leave

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:40.240
home and you don't get to school until ten o'clock, you know. And the teacher, Mr. what's

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.240
his name, I never forget, Mr. Dunn, he used to meet us halfway down the road with a big

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.440
bloody belt, you know what I mean. But we got him tricked anyway, because they used

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:57.520
to have a thing called a corage. It's a herb. You rub it in the middle of your hand, it

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.680
makes your hand go numb. So you can't feel anything, you know. The only time, don't let

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.160
him hit you over the palm. That's where it hurts. So if you rub it in, if it touch anywhere

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:14.760
on your skin, you come out in a rash, you know. But if you rub it in your arms, palms

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:20.320
like that, it makes the middle of your hand go numb, you know. And he used to come, you

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.320
know. And he used to say, hold out your hand. This is at the school gate before. Hold your

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.360
hands. Used to hit you in your arms, you know. But if you tried to run, you used to try and

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:36.360
get your legs. This was a running battle between the school and the kids, you know what I mean.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So, but the worst thing is, if they send a report home to your grandparents, they'll

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:51.520
be late to school, you know. Then you get another beating, you know. And that's how

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.960
it was. It was joyful to go to school. Because when we lived, we had a path running right

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.600
along our house, right. We used to play cricket out there and stuff, right. And there's a

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:10.680
place behind us called Goldsmith, a different little community. So if you walk down a path,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:16.200
it takes you ten minutes. But if you have to walk around, go around, it takes you another

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.480
half an hour. So being, you know, so we used to control that lane, you know what I mean.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.320
So anyone we falling out with, they ain't gonna pass, you know. We'd be stoning them

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.920
or whatever, you know what I mean. Used to wait for them at the bottom of the property

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.960
because you'd swap from the house down there and this would be a footpath. And there's

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.960
houses behind us, you know. Because there was no barter or such, you know, by the trees

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.400
and whose land is that, whose property is that. You know, there's no fencing, you know.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.960
But there's certain people that'll protect their property like the plant, certain mango

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.400
tree, you know when the mango is gonna drop and, you know, they'll be waiting for you,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.200
you know. You know, you could see people running through the cane field, you know.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.160
Oh, Mr. Harp is coming, you know what I mean. Try to get away, you know what I mean. And

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.440
that's how our life was, you know what I mean, back home. But when you came to England, everything

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.360
stopped. You're thinking, what the heck. I mean, you have to pay for everything, man.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.720
That's when you start paying, you know. There's no cricket field unless you pay to play, there

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:30.760
is nothing, you know. And where my parents lived, it was a coal industry, not steel industry,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.960
you know. It was like, West Midlands, you know, heart of the West Midlands, basically

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:44.960
steel. You know, my father, stepfather used to work in the London Steel Works, you know,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.800
which is like five minutes away. You could smell it, you know. My first thing in the

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.800
morning, I'd steal, they'd steal, truck, steal, you know. And I hated it, to be honest,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:02.080
you know. I did not like living there, you know. I used to go out, used to get locked

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.440
out of the house because, you know, 10 o'clock come, you're not home, you know, you don't

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.920
come in. You know, that's how my mother was, you know, because I fought E-Works, shift

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:18.920
works, you know, on and off, you know, stuff like that. So, yeah. So I think I spend about

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:28.640
after I left school, about 18 months at home, you know, and went to live in Wolverhampton,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:36.720
you know, because I had a problem, you know. You know, I was the problem, I was like, house

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.600
problem because I go out and don't come back here and I go try and get, go to a, because

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:49.600
I'm beginning to know a few people from Dudley because Dudley was two minutes away, you know,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.360
Dudley Zoo and places like that. So when I leave Wolverhampton, when I went to live

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.000
in Wolverhampton, I know the area, so I'm able to come back, like, to a place like Dudley,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
you know, where I used to go with my mother, pull in the trolley every Saturday morning,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.640
you know. I mean, that was, those days were done because I'm independent now, I live

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:13.640
by myself, you know. I have different friends in Wolverhampton, start coming back to Dudley,

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:21.280
Queen Mary Ballroom, which is where Lenny Henry used to perform before he became big,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:28.200
you know. And used to be running battles with Hell Angels because Hell Angels used to be

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.480
part of that gang then, because they used to control the Dudley, the Queen Mary Ballroom,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.000
as it were, you know, and they used to be, they did not like black people, you know what

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.560
I mean. They did not like black people. So we all used to catch the bus from, from Wolverhampton

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:50.160
to Dudley, and if you're from Wolverhampton, it makes you a Wolverhampton supporter, you

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:57.160
know, in football, right. Outside of Wolverhampton, a place called Garnall, from Garnall to Dudley

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:04.940
and the rest of the areas, or West Bramwich Albion, you know, the baggies on the walls.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.160
So you get to a certain part of, they stone the bus, especially if you see a black man

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.760
on that bus, you've got to put the seats up against the door, against the windows,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:21.760
you know. That used to be a regular occurrence on a Sunday night, because the police would

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.960
be out there waiting, because this is one of those stops where the bus has to stop,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:31.120
you know. I've been on the bus, rather than go down that way, they drive round and go

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.000
to the police station, because they'd be chasing the bus, you know, and stuff like that, you

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000
know what I mean. Yeah, so I live in Wolves. I got to know people, because I didn't know

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.400
anyone around there, got to know people, made friends with, you know, with all the, because

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.720
Wolverhampton is very black-oriented, you know, there's a lot of black people living

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.720
there, West Indians. So that's where my story is different from Glaston, in a way, because

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:04.720
I, Wolverhampton is a bigger town, more people, music, you know, and the police, you know,

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.280
and that's where I get involved with the music thing, because we set up a sound system, you

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:16.280
know, a group of us, you know. Little sound we had used to play, you know, Spiderman sound,

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:22.160
we used to call ourselves and play, you know, people used to turn up, all of a sudden people

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.680
start coming, you know, get bigger and bigger, and you know, so, and that's how it was.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:33.400
Then we start travelling outside of Wolverhampton, it's a good place, like Manchester, you know,

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:39.400
so I knew the culture of the music then, and once I got into a bit of trouble in Wolverhampton,

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:46.400
well, until this day I think we were innocent, but I think because we were young black kids,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:54.080
and the racist vibes then were rivers of blood by Enoch Powell, and I was watching a program

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:02.680
the other day, and you know, I didn't know this, but he was the man, he was the home

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:09.680
secretary firing secretary, I don't remember what it was, but when they started to recruit

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.600
West Indian people to come to England, he was the man that actually went to the Caribbean

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.400
and started recruiting nurses and telling people come to Britain, get a life, you know,

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.160
education, etc. And he's the one that turned around and told them, stop, because we're

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.920
going to have rivers of blood and stuff like that, you know, and I mean, the racist thing

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:35.920
was, you know, this is like back in the 70s, you know, 75, you know, I've only been in

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.480
the country about, what, possibly about less than five years, you know, so five of us end

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:51.760
up in Crown Court, because we got attacked, we got attacked, we didn't attack anyone,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.680
the one guy fell through the glass window, the one white guy, he was from Newcastle,

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:02.840
he was Newcastle supporters, and he fell through the glass, and they say that they were stabbed,

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.920
but you see the trouble is we didn't have anyone to defend us, to say, well, you know,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.840
we were just in court, they gave us a lawyer, I end up in bloody Staffordshire Crown Court,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:19.840
you know, it used to be called Staffordshire Assizes then, before Crown Court, I mean,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.800
I was sitting there, I was stood there, and the judge was bloody over there, half a mile

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:30.920
away, you need a bar necklace to see this guy, you know, so anyway, they say we started,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:39.160
they had me, what was the charge they put on me, causing an offrate, didn't know what

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.160
that was at the time, and two of my friends, they got jailed, you know.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.160
How old were you?

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:53.520
17, 18, you know, and yeah, I was around 18, you know, and the only reason we were in that

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.680
part of the town is because they wouldn't let us black people in any club unless you

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:08.240
knew someone who works there, or you're friendly with the doorman, but I had a friend who works

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.280
in the bar downstairs, and he used to let us in off the street, go to the bar, and upstairs,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:21.400
I used to hide in the dark, just to, you know, because the bouncers, they used to come around,

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.960
and you know, so we used to just smell her out in the, because it was quite a dark dance

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.720
room, you know, just split up, and just to be in there, you know, and we, but we had

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.160
to get there before 11 o'clock, because they closed the downstairs bar, and that's where

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.160
we were going, we were on our way to this club, when we got attacked, and we end up,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:49.160
my friend end up in hospital, and also all hell broke loose, so I had a friend living

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.240
in Birmingham at the time, so I thought, oh, you know, I couldn't even tell my mother then,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:01.240
because my mum just lived up the road, you know, and they said, oh, you've got to have,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:09.120
who's your next of kin, you know, and I'm like, oh, my mother, so, because I went to

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.040
live in Birmingham then, at the time of the friend, not live, but stayed with him, because,

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:19.360
you know, hopefully this thing would blow over, but never quite did, because I went

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.720
back to Wolverhampton, because I was signing the dole, and you know, when you go there,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:28.720
give you dole check and stuff, so, went there one morning, and they were waiting for me,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.840
the police, they, it was even on the radio, it was the most frightening thing, you know,

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:39.840
I'm telling you, so anyway, went through that, and they took me to this police station

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000
called Red Lion Street, little danger place, you know, so I gave my mother's name, and

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I, oh, my God, it's the worst thing I did, she comes there, you know, she weren't happy,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.040
you know, she said, you don't live at my, I've got five children, and they live at home,

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.400
in other words, you know, you're not included now, you know what I mean, the five that's

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.880
at home, they're on my priority, you know, you're moved out, you know, get on with it

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:15.840
then, you know, and that, you know, okay, went through the system, got to court, they

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:22.840
found me 30 pounds, this is not in 75, I mean, 30 pounds is a hell of a lot of money, didn't

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.440
you know, I thought they'd forgotten about it, didn't I, and it must be about two years

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.440
later, this guy come out, I don't know how they found out where I was, boom, boom, boom,

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:37.440
knock on my door, it's Mr. Gable, I'm saying, yeah, he says, oh, we've got to go, we have

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.560
a date, I'm like, yeah, where, Winston Green, that's the police station now, the jail house,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:50.560
took me straight to Winston Green, 30 days, so they put me in the cell, and I was like,

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:58.840
no, you know, and I don't, I think they're probably trying to frighten me, because the

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.840
cell, the wing, which they put me on, it was like, I'm walking along the corridors, and

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:10.840
I'm like, and in them days, they had little cards by the door, and it tells you how long

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:17.840
you're doing, and I'm walking along the door, I'm like, life, 20 years, this is what I'm

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:25.840
like, you know, and I remember there was a group of Chinese guys, it was a big thing

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:32.840
back then, you know, and they had, they all had 20 ideas each, because they were a harrowing

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:38.840
gang, right, and I'm like, Jesus Christ, it's a frightening thing in my life, right, so

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:45.840
they put me in the cell now, about two o'clock in the morning, I don't know if, it was late,

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:52.840
right, I could hear keys rattling, I could, and they opened the door, because I was in

00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:00.840
there by myself, there was a bunk bed in there, but I was in there, and I, you know, opened

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.840
the door, and I look up, I seen this guy walking, right, this man was about 6'6", you know,

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.840
big strapping white guy, I like my hat, I'm like, what the hell, you know, and I'm like,

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:17.840
why are they bringing him this time of morning, right, so I'm on the bottom bunk, shaking

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:24.840
like a leaf now, right, and I hear someone who goes, you're up mate, I'm like, yeah,

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.840
yeah, yeah, right, he said, don't worry mate, I'm only here till in the morning, I'm going

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:36.840
to Leicester, Leicester, you know, so they brought this guy from London, because Leicester

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.840
is closer, and he's in court in Leicester, so they brought him in overnight, right, with

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:49.840
no one else's knowledge, and stick with myself, this guy was only a cop shooter, innit, his

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:56.840
name was that guy, he was a big, he killed some policeman in London, right, so, anyway,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:03.840
they stick him in the cell with me, you know, I'm like, oh my God, you know what I mean,

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:13.840
I thought to myself, I don't like jail, I don't like jail, you know, and I came out,

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:20.840
and I moved to Birmingham then, and I moved to Edgbaston, you know, which was like, actually

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:27.840
I moved to a friend of mine called Robert, because I knew him from Wolverhampton, so

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:34.840
we got a flat together, both of us, and went to live in Edgbaston, City Road, you know,

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:40.840
and, but he was still working in the, further on in the Midlands, because he'd been working

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:46.840
there all his school life, a place called Darleston, and he says, yeah, I'll move to

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.840
Birmingham, let's get a flat together, man, so we went there, we got a flat together,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:57.840
share a house, you know, in Edgbaston, yeah, and from there, you know, the front line was

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:06.840
just down the road, you know, I'm quite acquainted with black people now, I can move around,

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:13.840
music business, and I got a job at Quick Save, there's a company, a Welsh company, yeah,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:20.840
Quick Save, and they opened a big warehouse in a place called Tipton, so we all went there

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.840
for a job, and we all got a job there, you know, it was about eight of us black guys,

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.840
you know, and we all started working there, you know, and the money was quite good, but

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:35.840
what it was, you could do a lot of overtime, right, so we used to go work at ten o'clock,

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.840
and come home at ten o'clock, you know, piling up the cash, we were earning good cash, you

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.840
know, and we had a flat, you know, we didn't worry about cooking, there was Mavis, Miss

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.840
Mavis down the road who cooks, we'd order dinners, Mavis, we're coming for dinner,

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.840
make sure you put the dinner up, you know, and the gambling is going on, we're playing

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.840
cards, so sometimes I come from work, I don't even bother to go home until bedtime, you

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.840
know, because it's so busy, there's the herbs man there, the pubs there, you know, it was

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.840
front line, this is the, you know, we never used to go to the city centre or anything,

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.840
everything you do in a community, you go play gambling, you lost your wages this week,

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:19.840
next week you'll win it back, you'll win back the same money you lost, you know, you're

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.840
not, you used to go around in circles, so you never used to have to leave the area,

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:30.840
you know, because the blues, this man called Dyke, he had a hairdresser shop, weekend,

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.840
he popped all the hairdresser stuff up and put the sound system in, you know, the pubs

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:41.840
across the road, you know, like it is on city road now, you know, you don't have to walk

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.840
far to get fresh product, because, you know, in the middle of Zoroastrian land, you know,

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:52.840
with the black community, you always get the food, you know, like I went to buy a piece

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.840
of yam the other day, I'd have to touch about 10 pieces before I feel what I want, you know,

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.840
because they've got it so long, but back then you could go and get the fresh stuff, you

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:07.840
know what I mean, and yeah, and that's how it was, everything was good, then a new influx

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:15.840
of West Indians start coming in now, this is like the early 80s, coming, you know, and

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:26.840
there's a new influx, and they've just, they change the whole, they change everything at

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.840
that point, you know, because when we came here, we came here, we went to school, we

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:37.840
did this, we did that, but the influx which was coming in, they came in after they were

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:44.840
in the school, I don't, you know, most of them came in on visas and coming as musician,

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:51.840
but they're not, but you could get a visa that way, you got to have a, you know, so

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:56.840
most, and there used to be a lot of artists from the Caribbean coming to England, you

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.840
just latch onto one of them, you know, and say, oh, I'm a drummer, I'm a diss, I'm a

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:08.840
that, I'm a that, bing, bing, bing, visa, but most of them are gangsters, to be honest,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.840
you know what I mean, I'm not talking, you know, they were, you know, and they had one

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:20.840
intention, earn money, money was their objective, money, money, and they'll do anything, you

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:28.840
know, anything, so therefore it becomes a war between themselves and people which are

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.840
already there, you know what I'm saying, like for instance, I used to go into the cafe where

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.840
we used to go for years and sit down, have a laugh and joke, play music in the back room,

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:44.840
all that stuff, because certain people start turning up, you know, I mean, so I left, you

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.840
know, you could see, well, I could, I could see what direction it was going, and once

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.840
I came to live in Cardiff and that, there's a few people I'd known back then who died,

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:03.840
who got killed, who was doing life and doing a lot of jail time because of certain things

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.840
that happened in their lives, you know, and you know, and that's how it was that time

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:15.840
when I left to come to Cardiff, because I'm thinking, you know, I didn't have a profession,

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.840
I'm living just on the main and where am I going to go, you know what I'm saying,

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.840
it's like, and I don't want to go to jail, I hate that place, you get me, so I thought,

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:34.840
my friend, you know, I had a friend who was a builder doing plaster and stuff like that,

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:40.840
and I used to work with him from time to time, you know, and the reason I, in Newport, they

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:49.840
were building a new estate, what's it called, anyway, they're building this new estate

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.840
and he had a job there working in some of the houses and, you know, did plastering,

00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:00.840
you know, and I used to come up with them and that's how it goes, you make a few young

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.840
ladies at the time, oh, come and stay with us, you don't have to go back to Brom, you

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.840
know, and stuff like that, and you know, and you start linking people, I used to come to

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.840
Cardiff and, of course, Newport, see, you would not believe, I reckon there's more

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.840
black people at that time living in Newport than there were in Cardiff, you know, the

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.840
real genuine West Indian, because if you go to Newport now, there are, well, I don't know

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:29.840
about now, but then there was quite a few West Indian, really, proper West Indian you

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.840
could deal with, there used to be a food shop there, there used to be a lady there, there

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:40.840
used to be a cafe called Silver Sands, which was like very popular, you know, food shop

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:47.840
upstairs, dance underneath, you know, and it was people from Bristol, they all used

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.840
to go there, you know, you cannot believe, right in the middle of Newport in Pyle, you

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.840
know, and that's, you know, and it was a regular thing to do, so we're going this weekend,

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.840
oh, we're going down to Newport, man, the Pyle thing is kicking, you know what I mean,

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.840
because there's a lot of girls from Cardiff used to go down there, you know what I mean,

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.840
because, you know, to be honest with you, the girls that were living in Cardiff at

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.840
that time, they weren't interested in the Cardiff men, because they were kind of slow,

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:19.840
they weren't up to date, you know, Glaston, he's saying everything is good, you know,

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.840
we kind of opened their eyes, really, when it comes to entertainment and music-wise,

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:29.840
because they had the Casablanca, but the Casablanca was entertained by outsiders, you know,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.840
it's our sound system from Birmingham, from London, Bristol, so you get a lot of influx,

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.840
especially this time of the year, you know, coming from all over, you know what I mean,

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:47.840
and having loads of babies and gone, you know what I mean, and so when I come, and I, you

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.840
know, I stayed on and stayed on, even myself, I got caught up, because I had a girl, my

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.840
son, mother, and that's how we linked up, because we used to go out, because we were

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:03.840
like modern day roads, but in a good way, you know, trouble a lot of girls, don't be

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:09.840
so honest, you know, so I came and I thought, when my son was born, I think, sheesh, I'm

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.840
going to do it myself now, you know what I mean, 90% of the men I know who had kids,

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.840
they took us back to their own community and do what they do, you know, but I didn't have

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:24.840
any ties of anything, I had no other kid, and he would have been, he was my first, you

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:31.840
know, so I stick around, and I thought, I'm getting older, I have to be doing something,

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:37.840
you know, and that's when I told you I went to see this guy in NACRO, right, NACRO, I

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:44.840
think, what the hell, he sounds black, you know, NACRO, but it was an agency for people

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:52.840
who had been inside and they're trying to, you know, reestablish themselves back in the

00:29:52.840 --> 00:30:00.840
community, but I didn't know that, and I went to see them, and he told me about, he

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.840
said, he only asked me what I can do, I didn't have a profession, I said, I can do anything,

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:10.840
man, I'm a sporting man, he said, yeah, you do sports here, took me up to Pentium, and

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:18.840
that's, didn't go long ago, that was back from 1982 or something, and he just dropped me

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:26.840
off, I met this lady, she was the, what you would call them now at the time, she wasn't

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.840
the education officer, she was the youth officer at the time, because they had two back then,

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.840
they had their education and they had the youth, and she was the youth, so her boss

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:43.840
was the education officer, so she said, oh yeah, come and have a job, part, you know,

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:50.840
and paid at the time, so I started doing it voluntarily, and I told you about, she got

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:57.840
me my first bank account, you know, which I still got now, worked up in Pentium for

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.840
about 10 years, working with young people, doing travel, and that's where I began to

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.840
think, oh man, I love this, you know, because I'm doing things now which I've never done

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.840
before, you know, I mean, which I would not have done if I had still been living in Birmingham,

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.840
even though I didn't go to college, but they helped me with the youth and coming to courses,

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:22.840
you know, just got to County Hall every Wednesday, and I got through that, and I've done the

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.840
outreach up in the Breckhens and stuff like that, you know, and that's how it's been,

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:34.840
that, you know, working from one centre to the next, just doing the things which I enjoy

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.840
doing, which was the sports side of it all, you know, I mean, I wasn't very good with

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.840
the paperwork, you know, I never bothered with that, so that's what I'm saying, the

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:52.840
thing I regret is not to pursue some kind of education, you know, because I can read,

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.840
I read, I read, I read anything, you know, reading is not a problem, it's my writing

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:04.840
is a problem, and tell you why, I used to work, and I think, I know everything, I look

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:10.840
at everything, I can read it, and I understand it, but I cannot put it down on paper, in

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.840
sentences, so I'm working, I'm doing an after school club over in, when I worked in Cardiff

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:23.840
High, I used to do Cardiff High lunch club, and I used to do after school club, I used

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:30.840
to pick the kids up from Redepenn High School, I mean, these are just babies, you know what

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.840
I'm saying, look at me, black man from nowhere, walking with doctors and whoever children

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:43.840
they are, you know, grabbing their bags, but I was loving it, you know, and so I went back

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:49.840
up one day, because I used to go there for three o'clock, right, because I used to

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:56.840
work, I used to do some cleaning job down in Cardiff Bay, because it was just been

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:02.840
building a new cinema complex down there, and I'm thinking, shit, I have a choice,

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:09.840
go back to Berlin, just try and do something, so when my son was born, and I decided to

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.840
get a job, you know, so I'm going down there, actually, there used to be an agent's and

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:21.840
city road agency, right, and I used to go to the local shop there, it was a coloured

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:27.840
guy, I can't remember his name, but I used to be friendly with him, you know, so I used

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.840
to go in, I said, hey, what's going on, I see loads of people coming in there, right,

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:36.840
he says, do you want a job? I said, yeah, I said, I don't want it too far, because I

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.840
haven't got a car, right, so he set me up, he got me a job down in the bay, just doing

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.840
basic cleaning in the cinema, you know, so you got to be there at six o'clock, you know,

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:50.840
I said, no problem, I cycle down there, used to do that, and when my second daughter, Sophie,

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:57.840
was born, she used to live around the corner, I used to zoom, zoom, zoom, cycle down there,

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:05.840
get back up, come on for a couple of hours, then I had to go to Riddipennine, got to

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:11.840
be there for three o'clock, pick the kids up and that, and then from there, six thirty,

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:17.840
I used to cycle to Pentwin, up to the Dome to do euphoric then, you know, so it's like

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:25.840
three days a week, it's like that's Riddipennine, you know, back and forth, you know, and that's

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:33.840
how life, that's how it's been, and so I went to pick a kid up one day, he had to do, stay

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:39.840
over and do some extra work, so I got to the school now and I'm speaking to the teacher,

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:47.840
she says, oh, the reason why Rachel, she's got dyslexia, I said, what the hell is that?

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:53.840
And then she started to tell me what it is, I'm thinking, maybe that's what I've got,

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.840
because I go to, because when I started first with the euphoric, right, this was the friary,

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:07.840
the old friary, right, I put myself on a course there to improve my writing skills or whatever,

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:13.840
you know, I did that and I'm like, I did it for about four months, man, and I just could not

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:18.840
get my writing together, you know, even though I know what I want to write, but I just could not

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:24.840
put it down on paper, so I thought, oh, look at this, I'll give up, I basically give up,

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:30.840
you know what I mean, I basically, but I'm saying, there is that thing out there, no one knew what

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.840
it is, even now, you know, you put that in the black community, they don't know what it is,

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.840
you know, and those are the things which probably holding back a lot of black people, you know,

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:46.840
because, you know, even now, I'm in Kiteiz and I can write and stuff like that, but I'm scared,

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.840
you know, people might think you're a dobat and that, but it's not a case of being, it's all up there,

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.840
like I'm telling you, I'm going to write a book one day, because I've got it up here, you know,

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:01.840
I haven't forgotten nothing at all, you know, things I've been through and stuff like that,

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:10.840
you know, but I want my kids to be, because, you know, they're hard work too, you know, when you go

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:15.840
and work with other people's children and you get the most respect and, you know, they're not

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:21.840
disrespectful at all, they're, you know, but my two daughters, I've got two daughters and they don't

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:27.840
seem to get on, like Lassandra said, they're from different mothers, but I've always been there,

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.840
you know, even though I don't really get on with the mothers anymore, because I've been with Suna

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:40.840
for about over 15 years, you know, and it's her, we've done a lot of things together, you know,

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:46.840
we do a lot of travelling, you know, I mean, the first time I went back to Jamaica, it was because of her,

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.840
you know, because she's been there prior and that, and, you know, she speaks, she knows how to deal with

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.840
all these holiday people and etc., you know, probably I wouldn't have learned to do that,

00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:00.840
and, you know, and through that I learned to deal with all that, you know what I'm saying, so,

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:06.840
for my children, they always, they come, she remembers their birthdays, she remembers,

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:13.840
so, it's Sophie's birthday or it's Alexia's birthday, she's got it all covered in that angle, you know what I mean,

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:20.840
so, you know, it's just that they, you know, I want more from them, but then again, who knows,

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.840
my parents probably wanted more from me, but they're healthy, they're good health, you know,

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:33.840
and I'm happy with that, you know, they're all out there doing their thing, they're working, they don't do drugs,

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:42.840
you know, so, altogether, I think Cardiff's been, you know, Wales has been good for me, from what I was,

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:52.840
you know, even though I didn't get into any trouble, you know, and stuff, but I'm more involved with my family

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:58.840
now than I was when I was living there, even though they were closer, you know what I mean,

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.840
and, you know, because I've got three sisters, I can pick the phone up to any one of them at any time,

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.840
and, you know, they will be there, when I was living in Birmingham, I would never go near the house,

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:17.840
you know, the fact is, what my mother's going to say, you know, because to be honest, I was kind of scared of my mother,

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:24.840
and I think what it was, because I didn't bond with her when I was a kid, my grandparents was my mum,

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:30.840
my grandmother was my mother, you know, her mum around my life, you know, and grandfather came to England,

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:36.840
my mother, she had her own children, you know, there was nothing there to say,

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:46.840
I remember you and I was like two or three years old, because I don't, you know, I can't say I remember at all before I came to England,

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:54.840
you know what I'm saying, I came here when like 14, 15, it's like this is the first time we've met, you know,

00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:01.840
so you can imagine it was hard to settle in the house, knowing I got two other brothers, which are half brothers,

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:08.840
and their father live in the house, you know, they don't think that, see, but they don't know what goes through your head,

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:17.840
because I can see, you can see, as a man, you come from the Caribbean as a youth, you're older than them, you know more than them,

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:26.840
you know, and their father is there, they're like, they're these are my boys, you know, and you know, and that's how it is, you know,

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:36.840
so I think I got out at the right time for them to strive, and they did, you know, even on harsh circumstances,

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:46.840
you know, they all, one, two, three sisters, they all went to uni, got good jobs, paid work, married, settled down,

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:55.840
and they all live happily ever after down there now, and I can go visit whichever, you know, I mean, and the relationship is good,

00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:05.840
you know, compared to what it was when I first came to England, and living in the West Midlands, I hated it, you know, at the time,

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:13.840
you know, at the time, you know, I hated it, you know, and I come to ways, you know, and like Glasson's saying,

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:19.840
I know there's a lot of prejudice, prejudice going on, but I find I get more prejudice from the black people than I do from the white people,

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:27.840
you know what I'm saying, because I go into, going down there in Butown now, which I didn't grow up down there,

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:36.840
I go down there as an outsider, which they do, if you're not part of that community from, you don't get a bloody, you know what I mean,

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:43.840
they're very cautious, you know, you interfere with any other, you know, the girls, they're all someone trying to knock you back,

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:50.840
because of all that, you know, but keeping the blues, you know, they all used to come to the blues, you know, oh, oh, Brammy, they're, you know,

00:40:50.840 --> 00:41:01.840
they don't like it, you know, so it's been a, you know, but I tend to keep out of that type of thing, you know, rather than get involved,

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:10.840
because I know you come down here, because we all do, we come down here and you see things looking quiet and everybody's happy,

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:18.840
you think, oh, we could do this, we could do this down here, but I do, I know a lot of people who've done that and end up in jail,

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:26.840
come down here, get involved with certain things, I'll be like, hey, don't you be doing that, you know, it's easier, next thing you know,

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:37.840
they're doing sentences and I've got my friends, you know, who came down here, got involved with whatever they do and they end up in prison, you know,

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:46.840
I came down here, I've been down here, what, God knows, about 40 years, near enough, I've never been to jail, I've been to court, you know,

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:55.840
yeah, I mean, you know it is, you know, women report you to police or, you know, just because you're telling them the right thing,

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:01.840
not because you're doing anything wrong, you know, you're telling them the right thing, you know, and they're like, I'm not having that,

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:11.840
but down here, the policemen, they didn't know, they don't know much about black people, see, and that's the trouble with this, with Cardiff,

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:20.840
they do not know anything about Caribbean people, you know, they don't know how they tick, you know, it's like in the youth service,

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:30.840
you don't see many black youth leaders or shop workers, you know, like you'd see in the West Midlands or anywhere else,

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:36.840
you go into any one of those like boots chemists or any one of those boutiques or footwear shops, you know,

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:42.840
there's black guys working all over the place down here, you very rarely see them, I'm thinking, is it because they're black,

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:53.840
is it because, you know, are they that stupid? But no, I think it's improving, you know, than from 10 years, 15 years ago,

00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:00.840
you know, the racism thing is coming more to the fore and says, hey, there is racism out there, you know what I mean,

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:09.840
there's a lot of it out there, but no one take any note, it just comes natural to most people, you know, they say things to you and you're like,

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:16.840
oh, you're my friend, I'm not racist towards you, you know what I mean, I said, mate, you racist to that lady there,

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:22.840
you racist to me, because you might not say the same thing to me, but you'll say to someone else about me, you get me,

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:28.840
that's racism anyway, you know what I mean, you don't be, oh, you can be racist to that man there and not be racist to me,

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:38.840
because you're my friend, you know, so, you know, so it is, isn't it, you know, because I've got three children anyway,

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:45.840
I haven't got any kids, any one son, he's a big man now, I don't even know, he was in Jamaica the last time,

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:58.840
but I've got three children, I've got one son and two girls, and I've got three grandchildren, four, three girls and one boy,

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:07.840
you know, and I see them all the time, you know, they're back and forth, you know, I go and visit them, you know,

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:16.840
so, and that's it, you know, racism don't, I don't ever think about it, it's only sometimes there's some people who say they're a little shocked with it,

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:22.840
you know, it's like, well, you still think that way, do you, you know what I mean, and stuff like that, but other than that,

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:34.840
you know, I wish, I just wish education was a thing I could handle, you know what I mean, you see, you know, because that's what's stopping black people,

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:41.840
and that's where most of the racism comes in, because there's not enough space for everyone in Wales to climb the ladder, you know,

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:51.840
and they're very true, they're picking true so they want to, you know, I mean, I know, because I work in, since I work with Welsh speaking people,

00:44:51.840 --> 00:45:04.840
and I work with like, kids in Cardiff High, you know, the rich kids in Cardiff High, they get priority, if you can donate, you know,

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:15.840
that's all they operate, you donate and you're part of this, you know, you'll do anything for your kids to get them to graduate for uni, you know what I'm saying,

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:28.840
I work in Glantaff, they don't care where you come from, you know, they'll help you, that's what from my perspective, because my daughter,

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:35.840
Sophie, she went to a Welsh school, you know, and she comes, she's brighter than the other two, you know what I'm saying,

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:43.840
you know, she is, to be honest with you, she's brighter than the other two, you know, I work in Glantaff over there in the youth, in the youth club there,

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:55.840
I speak to so many different kids, mixed-race kids, kids from in the valleys, you know, and the only thing they don't like is that the fact they have to speak the language in school,

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:06.840
you know, when they're in school, they have to speak Welsh, but once they're outside, you don't have to, so when they come into the centre, we speak English,

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:15.840
most of, well they all do, but you know, and I think a lot of colour people, they'll send their kid to go there, they say, oh the Welsh is not good, they don't want to speak Welsh,

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:25.840
well I tell you what, you go to a Welsh school, you ten times get a better job than any other kids out there, you know, because they want these kids to be bilingual,

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:30.840
you know, they want them to speak the Welsh language, you know, do you speak Welsh?

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:40.840
Yeah, you go, you know, they want them to speak the Welsh language, you know, it's like me, if I get rid of my patwa, who would I be?

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:50.840
You know what I mean, you know, who would I be, you know what I'm saying, you've got to keep part of your culture, you know, you go to anywhere in the world,

00:46:50.840 --> 00:47:04.840
you say, believe in Wales, do you speak the language? No, you know what I mean, but you have to, and that's why I respect the Welsh speaking people,

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:14.840
people might say they are this and that, but I know a few of them, and they're tough people, they've got different way of thinking,

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:28.840
just to the other, you know what I mean, so, my friend, he lives in Splough, and you know, his father was the headmaster of Cotay's High School for years and years,

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:36.840
but they went to Welsh speaking school, you know, and most of those people, kids go to Welsh speaking school, you know what I mean,

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:44.840
because I think they reckon their education is a little better standard than it is in the normal school, even though they say Cardiff High,

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:52.840
you know, but there's a lot of Asian in Cardiff High, because when I was there, and they are the brightest, you know what I'm saying,

00:47:52.840 --> 00:48:02.840
and there's a lot of resentment over there, because I worked there, and I, in the youth club, and I see the racism that, you know, the kids,

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:10.840
not from the school, because I don't deal with, I'm dealing with the kids in the playground, you know, I could see their attitude to Asian,

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:18.840
but they're not troublemakers, they're just cleverer than the rest of them, and that's all it is, you know, because Sue, her son, her grandson,

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:29.840
because she's got a daughter, Michelle, and her son is in Cardiff High, you know, and doing brilliantly, you know, he's doing robotics and stuff like that,

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:37.840
and just cause she's pushing, pushing, pushing, you know, and he's doing well there, you know, and a lot of the Asians do well there,

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:46.840
a lot of the African black kids that goes there do well, you know, so I wish I had done well in my time, who knows, I could have been a professor or something.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.840
Wow, it's not too late to get into the university.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.840
You know, you're a professor, right?

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.840
You're a professor.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.840
Yeah, it's good to know.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:03.840
Can I take you back for a second? I really wanted to know, what, what did your mother do? Did she do the same thing in Jamaica that she did,

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.840
I know you didn't know her in Jamaica, you knew her only when she was in England.

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:13.840
Well, apparently, apparently, she was going to a, is it a teacher's nursing college? Because I think one of my aunties went to that college,

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.840
she was going to a nursing thing, you know, and I think that's the reason she came here so early in her life,

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:24.840
because the idea is come to England and finish her studies, you can be a proper midwife or something like that.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.840
What year did she come with you?

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:32.840
She came in the 50s, just after, 59, I think.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.840
And how long after?

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:42.840
Because I was born in 54, you know what I mean? So you can imagine, she left me when I was like a toddler, you know?

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:56.840
So I came here in, I think about 1968, 68, 69, because I remember when I came here, the first year Manchester United won the European Championship,

00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:07.840
I think it was about 1968, because I remember watching that on the black and white TV, you know, because that's what we had, you know, I remember then.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:18.840
So I think it was about 1968 I came here, yes, or late, 60, 67, you know?

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:28.840
But I do remember, I was in Jamaica when England won the World Cup, which was not, that's when Glaston came here, but I was still in Jamaica then,

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:37.840
because Glaston came when I was 10, I came when I, because I think I had one year left in school before when I came,

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:51.840
because when they say you could come to England and bring your kids with you, I think the cutting-edge point was 15, because I leave school at 15,

00:50:51.840 --> 00:51:01.840
so I had to come to England before I was 15 years of age, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to until I was 18 or something like that,

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:13.840
so that's where I think they got mixed up, because I could remember my auntie used to take me on the truck to go to Kingston, you know?

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:23.840
So she could sort the paperwork out, because hell of a lot of trouble in there just to get the papers you require to come to England as a kid,

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:29.840
and that's what killed you, you're thinking, shit man, they don't know how the trouble we've gone through to get here, you know what I mean?

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:35.840
And they turn around, they think, oh yeah, you jump on one of those boats coming from France,

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:44.840
you can't walk from the Caribbean to England, you can't, there's no way, you're talking thousands of miles, you know?

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:48.840
So, it's been awesome man, Jesus.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.840
You remember the journey?

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:57.840
Yeah, I remember when my auntie put me on the plane, like I said, I remember we staying off in New York,

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:04.840
I was stuck off in New York, but the fact is, when I got to London, I thought there was someone going to come and get me from there,

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:13.840
so they just stuck me in a room all day, I think I must have been there for about 6, 7 hours in this one room, all by myself,

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:19.840
I cry like a baby, because I'm thinking, where's everyone, who's picking me up, you know?

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:26.840
It's only like about 6 o'clock in the evening, they says, oh come, we're going now, I'm like, where are we going, it's all going to burn in here,

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:31.840
you know, my senior, I think I am in Birmingham, you know, so they flew us from London to Birmingham,

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:39.840
so I actually got two planes to get here, you know, so, and that's where my mum and my stepdad picked us up from,

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:48.840
I can remember they picked us up in the Zephyr 6, you know, those Zephyrs, I don't know, big, you know, because he liked the caruban,

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:56.840
he was quite a poser, you know, he was, yeah, he picked us up in the Zephyr, he was pitch black then, you know, I mean, the day is gone,

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:06.840
I could see his white stuff, because there was snow on the ground, you know, got me back to Dudley Road, man,

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:16.840
there's a fireplace there, I'm just cold, cold, cold, cold, I was cold for 6 months, really, I end up, I get in,

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:26.840
I end up with all these football scars rather than anything else, you know, these are not, you know, but I had chill blame,

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:33.840
you know what chill blame is, I had that when I was a kid, because I used to be sat in front of the fire like that every time my mum turned her back,

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:41.840
you know what I mean, because otherwise, let the heat spread, but it was only two frigging bars, you know what I mean, let the heat spread,

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:50.840
but, and they only would light the fire on the weekend, because we had a fire thing, coke, coke fire, it wasn't even coal, it was coke,

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:58.840
the cheapest stuff, but it used to burn hot, but quicker than the normal coal, it doesn't give off as much smoke,

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:06.840
so when she used to order coke, big bloody lorry used to turn up, emptied a lot of it in the front yard,

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:16.840
so well, I have to shovel it down the cellar, because the cellar is the coldest cellar in history, believe you, me, you go down the cellar,

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:25.840
then you freeze, I swear to God, you open the door, you go, it's frozen, it was a cold cellar, you know what I mean,

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:33.840
but no other one go down there, because I was the eldest, I had to go and get the coal, I was like, Jesus Christ, you knocked down that cellar there,

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:42.840
yeah man, because on top of the cellar, you have the front room, you know, black people, the front room, you don't use it,

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:50.840
you only use that for when relatives or friends come, you know, you've got to heat it up for about a week before it gets hot,

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:58.840
because you're so cold, because it's rotting in the cellar, yeah, so it's a turn it, and that's the only place they had electric heater,

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:05.840
that's the only room, there was electric heater in the front room, you know what I mean, I said turn the heater on in the front room,

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:13.840
leave it on for about a week, because the aunties come from London, or somebody's coming to spend a day or two,

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:21.840
so you get to get in the front room, you get to get the cockerels out, yeah, madness man,

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:33.840
so you know, within that period of time, I learned to cook, so therefore I was quite independent, from back home up until then,

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:41.840
I was independent, you know what I mean, so I didn't have, no one could have, well most of the girlfriend, I had a teacher,

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:50.840
most of the girls, in terms of domesticating themselves and cooking, and you know, I mean so that's how it was,

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:57.840
because all my girls I've been at within Wales, half of them didn't know nothing, you know what I mean,

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:07.840
so you know, that's how it was, I'm teaching them from when I was a kid, you know, so yeah, my mother, she was a,

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:15.840
you know, she used to show me how to season the meat and the chicken, how to brown the chicken and you know, stuff like that,

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:20.840
how to cook the peas before you put the rice in and you know, all them type of stuff, you know what I mean,

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:27.840
I've been doing this since I was a kid, you know what I mean, because I used to have to cook, yeah, I used to have to cook for my younger siblings,

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.840
you know, because they're at work, you know what I mean, she used to peel the potato before she goes to work, right,

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:42.840
and the school I went to, which is like, it's called Tivydale Comprehensive, right, it was about five minutes away, right,

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:48.840
I used to leave the potatoes, she says, you got to come home and peel the potatoes,

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:55.840
so when everyone is running around at lunchtime, I had to run home and peel the potatoes,

00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.840
so when she comes home, she can cook, she can start the cooking, you know what I mean,

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:09.840
so when the kids come home, they can, you know, stuff like that, you know, Sunday, I have to season the meat and you know what I mean, yeah,

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:15.840
because she used to have me walking behind her with her trolley, man, used to go to West Bromwich,

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:21.840
go to West Bromwich, I used to support the Albion, right, every Saturday morning, used to go to Dudley, right,

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:28.840
and she used to stop and talk to everyone, and Lenny Henry's mother, which she knew,

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:36.840
they used to stop in the Dudley town, they used to have a market, right, right in the middle of the town,

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:43.840
they sell West Indian food and you know, unless we were all the black people, used to congregate on Saturday morning,

00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:49.840
you know, and I used to be there standing over there in the corner with her trolley, waiting for her to finish talking,

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:55.840
you can't get involved in their discussion, you know what I mean, and she's like, how is Lenny doing, you know what I mean,

00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:01.840
Lenny, Lenny was making a name for himself and all that, so every half an hour I'd freeze my nuts off,

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:08.840
like, you know what I mean, it's like, come on, what you can't shout, so, oh my God, so anyway,

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:13.840
and she used to catch the bus then and goes to West Bromwich to pick the meat up from a different place,

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:19.840
she's going to buy meat around the corner, but she got this special man who does the meat, you know,

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:23.840
and she'll catch, just come, we're going to West Bromwich, she's like, what for, we've got to get the meat,

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:29.840
and you know, I'm like, God, here we go, off we go, on the bus to West Brom,

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:35.840
and by this time there's a lot of football supporters who's coming out of Dudley going to the football match,

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:40.840
but the football match is not until three o'clock, and these guys are catching the bus like one, two o'clock, I'm thinking,

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:45.840
so one Saturday morning she said to me, I want you to go to West Bromwich, she ordered the meat,

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:52.840
because she works in West Bromwich in the hospital, so she ordered the meat from the guy to be picked up on the Saturday morning,

00:58:52.840 --> 00:59:00.840
so she said, go get the meat, you know, give me a bus fare and stuff to catch a bus to West Brom,

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:06.840
so I went, jumped on the bus, and it was all these full of football supporters, so I'm thinking in my head,

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:11.840
I'm going to a football match, never been to a football match yet, so I think I'm going to a football match, innit,

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:20.840
so I start following the crowd, yeah, I'm following the crowd innit, and I got there and I got off the bus,

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:29.840
the crowd disappeared, you know, all the people on the bus, they just disappeared, and I stood by myself outside the football ground,

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:38.840
I'm like, shit, what am I going to do, I had money to pay, so I walked around, and I walk around one entrance,

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:44.840
and I see people going into this entrance, so I thought, I'll go with this lot innit,

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:55.840
so I'm walking up now, the guy said to me, you're never the security guy, what team you play for man, he goes, what team you play for,

00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:02.840
I'm like, what, I said I'm trying to get into the ground, and it's a good job, it was a black guy, well mixed race guy,

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:10.840
and he said, just go back there and go through there, so he let me in, so I walk along the terrace now,

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:15.840
the match haven't even started yet, so I walk along the terrace, and I go to the end,

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:20.840
we're the West Brom and Jalberts supporters, I'm standing there, I'm trying to look for these guys now,

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:28.840
can't see any, they're all white guys, you know what I mean, they're full of white, I'm like, shit, so I stood behind the goals,

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:37.840
I never forget, it was Crystal Palace v West Brom and Jalberts, it was a FA Cup, it was a big match too, it was a FA Cup semi-final,

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:44.840
and so I stood behind the goal, I seen three brilliant headed goals that day, a guy called Jeff Astle,

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:52.840
he was the star of the West Brom and Jalberts football team, he scored a fantastic headed hat-trick,

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:59.840
I stood right there and watched, so I started to support the Albion then, because when I was in Jamaica,

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:05.840
you hear about teams, and I used to support West Ham, and when I came to England, I found out West Ham is in London,

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:11.840
I'm like, bloody hell, that's a farce, because they had World Cup players, see, they had Bobby Moore, they had the Jeffers,

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:18.840
and the people who actually played in the World Cup, so I want to be supporting a team which has got a name,

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:28.840
but I didn't know you had Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers, West Brom and Jalberts, all in the vicinity of about 20 miles around Birmingham,

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:36.840
so I started to go to the Albion there, and then when I moved to Wolverhampton, I started going to the Maldives,

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:45.840
which is Wolverhampton Wanderers, and I supported them for a few years because my friend, Ralphie, a black guy I met when I went to live there,

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:52.840
he was very close to some of their players, so he introduced me to players like John Richards, Derek Dugan,

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.840
these are all famous footballers, and that's how close he could have got to these guys back then,

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:06.840
because they always used to do train and gamble, they always be in the band office, and they used to slip you a fiver there,

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:13.840
have a go, try, you know, and stuff like that, and Ralphie, he knew all this, so he was close to them,

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:23.840
and yeah, that's how it was, football was like, yeah man, and it continues, his life, it was,

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:32.840
but yet, in all that, it's only the one period of racism I encountered when I was in Wolverhampton,

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:40.840
and it wasn't people from Wolverhampton, these people are from, they were Jardis, they were from Newcastle,

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:48.840
other than that I never encountered, I was in a little gang called the Templar Street Mafia,

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:55.840
which, you know, you've got to be part of something, you know, so as we were uptown boys, we used to go uptown,

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:05.840
and they had a little gang called the Templar Street Mafia, because Templar Street is where the Express and Star paper used to be,

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:12.840
and they used to have a little area where they used to stand around, you know, hang around, like something,

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:20.840
and they called themselves Templar Street Mafia, but it was all a mixture of black guys and white guys, Asian guys, you know,

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:31.840
and yeah, I met a guy, he was kind of my best, Krishna his name was, he was Sri Lankan, first Sri Lankan I ever made, you know,

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:38.840
that guy, he was a top top man, you know, everyone loved Krishna, you know, I think because he was rich,

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:46.840
because he was rich, someone in his family was rich, you know, he used to wear the best gear, you know, because back then,

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:56.840
what you wear say a lot, you know, I mean, if you're not wearing the same modern outfit, you can't be in that little posse there,

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:05.840
you know, I mean, because these guys, Ben Sherman and you know, that type of the gear in them days, you know, the Harringtons and stuff like that,

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:11.840
you know, I couldn't afford none of that, but my mate Krishna, you know, I mean, he said, come on, buy your share, bro, you know, I mean,

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:20.840
then, because he used to work in shops, and he knew all the shop, you know, and that's how it was, it was just one fantastic, you know,

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:29.840
I was carefree, if you put it that way, you know, I mean, it's only when I came to Wales, I had to put the socks up, you know,

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:38.840
because kids are involved now, in a different, it's like a different planet, you know, I'm saying it's, yeah, it opens up, you know,

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:47.840
I'm talking to people who I've never spoken to if I was in Birmingham, you know, I mean, like, get close to people in higher positions, you know,

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:53.840
like, sure, I mean, Birmingham, where do you find these people, you know, I mean, so.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:05:02.840
Do you feel like your sense of belonging or identity shifted over the years? So you came in as Jamaican. Do you still feel Jamaican? Do you feel more British?

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:11.840
Yeah, well, I tried to feel, I tried to, I would not try and lose my Jamaican identity, even though, who knows, one day I might win the pool,

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:20.840
so I'll go there to live, who knows, but I love the Caribbean, I travel, since I've been to Wales, we traveled all over the Caribbean, you know,

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:33.840
he's only last year I was in St. Lucia, you know, and he's like, it's beautiful, man, you know what I'm saying, I try to do things which I didn't do as a kid,

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:46.840
so I go back to Jamaica now, last year, year before last, we went to the Blue Mountains, right, which I've heard about it, so many, I've never been there, you know what I mean,

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:57.840
so I think if I go to Jamaica, that's where I want to go, you know, so we went to the Blue Mountains up in the, it's beautiful, you know, I mean, you know, I got photography,

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:08.840
you know, I cycled down it as well, you know what I'm saying, that's what I want to do, do things which I didn't get to do as a kid, you know,

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:24.840
when I was a kid, this would be a thing called Roaring River, right, and Roaring River was near to the school I went to, right, and you know, and I've never been to Roaring River,

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:40.840
and that's where, it's a raster community, right, where they do farming and, you know, gardens, beautiful, but as a kid, it wouldn't be like that, and they had a cave there as well,

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:51.840
never been in a cave, you know, so I said, yeah, I want to go to Roaring River, man, I go there, oh my God, my heart melted, you know what I mean, this is next door to where I grew up and born,

01:06:51.840 --> 01:07:03.840
I had never been there, like 50 years later, you know what I'm saying, it's like, it turns your head in, you know, yeah, man, and that's what I like to do when I go back, you know what I mean,

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:16.840
and the people, you know, they're there, they don't live there, but it's a very tourist place now, you know what I mean, you can go there, you can book a day to go there, have a meal, you know, play drums,

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:26.840
it's a proper raster camp, you know what I mean, proper documented and everything, you know, they've got brochures where people can go and visit and stuff like that,

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:40.840
but, and that was just on the road from where I grew up, but I never knew anything about it, you know, so I thought, yeah, I'll go back and see that, you know, because you can talk about it, you know, I could remember you said,

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:57.840
because what it was, you know, sugar cane is, in Jamaica at one point, it was the biggest island for cane, when the British was controlling things there, they plant sugar cane everywhere, you know what I mean, so there was a lot of sugar cane,

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:14.840
so there was a place, they call it the Heist, right, there's a, used to be a sugar cane factory, it's on this place called Froum, and Froum, Froum was the biggest sugar cane, what do you call?

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:15.840
Plantation?

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.840
Yeah, but where you take the cane to be turned into rum.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:19.840
Industrial?

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:43.840
Yeah, industrial factory, right, you take it there, so what they do, they have a place called the Heist, if people want to sell the cane, they don't take it direct there, they take it to the Heist, have it weighed, and you get paid there, and then the train comes along, you put it on there, and they put it on a train, and they take it to the factory, so they could pulp it into, you know,

01:08:43.840 --> 01:09:12.840
and we used to have the trucks, like the tractors, pulling the canes out, you know what I mean, and they'd be guys on the top, because they don't want, they want the weight, you know what I mean, they'd probably hit you as well, you know what I mean, so you'd pull the cane out, the big one, but until you get to the Heist, but I've never been further than the Heist as a kid, and all that was behind me, all the Ruhran River and all down there, was all down behind the Heist, but I'd never been there, like you know, the furthest I got was up to the Heist,

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:32.840
because what, we were only kids then, you know, so I tried to go back there and I find out, you know, it's like a new world, man, got this Ruhran River place, man, it's beautiful, I don't have a photograph, but I've got a photograph of some of the, let's see if I've got a picture of Ruhran River in here,

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.840
I'm sorry, are we still talking?

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:43.840
No, you can have a look at that, so in terms of your identity, you feel Jamaican, you don't feel British?

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:59.840
Nah, I feel more Welsh than British to be honest, because I lived here longer than I lived in England, you know, so, kids are Welsh, you know what I'm saying, so Welsh is like my second home, isn't it, you know,

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:18.840
I mean, I go to England, I've, nothing changed in Britain, man, too much people, that's why, you know, jump on the bus, the bus is full, the walk on the street, the sidewalk is full, you know, the noises, I come back to Wales, I feel much more comfortable,

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:35.840
so, yeah, that's me, man, but I'll go anywhere, you know, obviously, I've met so many people over the years since I've been here, you know what I mean, it's good people too, you know what I mean, knowing that they're straight,

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:59.840
I mean, living in the middlelands at the time, you didn't know who to trust, you know, there's so much things going on, you know, so many trickery, so many drugs, and, you know, and I know, if I had still been there, I wouldn't be sitting there talking to you now, you know, because it's totally different, you know what I'm saying,

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:27.840
I know people calling me, one day, I got people ringing me up, call me Colombo, they call me Colombo, you know, I'm coming down, you know, they're desperate to get out, you know what I mean, they are desperate to move out, you know, so they goes there, I go back down there and say, boy, you look good, Colombo, yeah, you know what I mean, stuff like that, you know, and I'm older than them, you know, you know what I mean, so, I'm thinking, don't do what you do, man, I don't bleach anymore, I don't spend, you know, don't smoke, you know, you know, don't need, you know, I'm done, I'm done, man, I'm done, I'm done.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.040
weed and don't eat and you know I goes up my bike you know there's room for me to go and exercise

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:40.400
you know I'm saying in Birmingham there's no such thing you know there is but you'll have to travel

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:48.560
you know where I can just jump from a bike now I could go to the break-ins I'm back you know without

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:56.880
no traffic no anything no fumes I think that's part of it as well you know the air condition down

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:03.840
is much better it's much warmer as well then you wouldn't believe how cold burning it is Jesus

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.680
is fucking cold side it is freezing you know this fog you wake up in the morning you can't die

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:15.760
you can see out the window there's so much fog here it is you know it's just you know people

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:21.520
walking around with whatever you know so it's healthier living down here to be honest you know

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:31.520
it's much healthier your condition is better and there's less people not many people very

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:36.160
rocking up my door you know it's people who I invite not people who just turn up because

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:43.760
you know I mean I like it like that you know like the peace and quiet you know like the

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:52.400
the hustle and the bustle you know I mean yeah so who knows one day I might win the

01:12:52.400 --> 01:13:00.640
pools if I was to go back and leave Cardiff you'd be going back to the Caribbean somewhere

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:06.720
you know I mean I would not say I would want to go back to Birmingham to live

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:13.200
you know because it's it's like to me you'll be going backwards if I had education and I could go

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:21.520
go back there and help you know like working in the with young people and help in that way I would

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:29.680
you know but just to go back and live no I don't think so you know I could find somewhere better

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:36.160
than this to see you know my house somewhere you know out in the country somewhere yeah it'd be

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:43.760
that would be ideal you know that would be somewhere near the sea perhaps you like what

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:52.720
you like yeah yeah well live on one of those Caribbean islands out there so maybe Trinidad

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:59.680
who knows yeah because I have been to Tobago I've not been to Trinidad I've been to Tobago

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:05.040
it's similar to Jamaica you know all the islands are similar you know there is

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:13.680
you know we do the same thing yeah good stuff you finished now

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.680
oh dear
