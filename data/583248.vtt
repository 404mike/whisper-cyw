00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.560
Good morning. The Gulf War is over, but we still live in a world that is sick, riddled

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:33.000
with fear and in great danger. The Gospel does not take evil lightly. There's never any suggestion

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.640
that the world is not such a bad place after all, and that man's a fine fellow at heart, and if we

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:48.080
only leave humanity to itself and give it a chance, it'll muddle through in time. There is no assurance

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:56.360
that man is really a very decent fellow, and if he does make mistakes, he's doing his best,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:05.960
and anyhow he's very sincere. Especially at this time, we can have no illusions. We cannot,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.040
if we are honest, blame all the ills on the shoulders of one man. Lots of people made handsome

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.920
prophets by helping Saddam Hussein on his evil way. The world's sickness extends to the hungry

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.360
and the homeless and the poor, the abused, and the reliance of nations on war as a weapon of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:40.600
justice. But having said that, the Gospel is not a Gospel of do. Yes, the world is in danger,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:50.880
and the Gospel says so because it strips off all unreality and fearlessly exposes the truth. The

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:01.200
Gospel alone can do that because it also has a remedy. When you're ill, you can face the worst

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:11.560
diagnosis if you know there is a certain cure, and there is. The world as we see it reflects the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.480
soul and the thinking of man. The world is the outward expression of mankind's inner thoughts,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:27.680
and those thoughts can undergo the most radical change. The good news that Jesus brought is the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.400
proclamation that the reign of God is there for the taking. Now we might have thought that such

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.320
a Gospel would have been grasped by humankind with joyous gratitude, but on the contrary,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.680
its very goodness has been the ground of its rejection. It's been condemned without trial

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:58.960
as too good to be true. We have seen that the impending disaster is a material one,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:07.000
the homeless on our streets, the starving millions of Africa, but we know that behind it and the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.960
cause of it is a spiritual disaster. By allowing God's thoughts to begin to determine our thoughts,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:24.920
the spiritual regeneration is set in motion. In the mind of God, there is already a new world

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:36.120
order. Let that mind be new, which was also in Christ Jesus. We think of God as being almighty.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:47.800
Can we also think of God as love and to believe that love is almighty, that love can overcome

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:56.240
all things? It's a thought. No, no, it's more than a thought. It's a revolution.
