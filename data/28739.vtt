00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So this is, anyway, this is my mother-in-law's diary.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What's her name?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Marion Cartwright.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Well Marion did this one.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Yes.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what can you do?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, this one is from 1940 and it's February to, I think, about April.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And she was nursing behind, oh no, it goes all the way through the year, February to November.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
She nursed in the desert, this was when she was in Libya.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And she was right, you know, casualty clearing station, so I was taking casualties straight from the battle.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And we've got a whole series of them all through the war.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And she's serviced all through the war.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I mean, my husband keeps saying we're going to transcribe them one of these days, but it's quite dense.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And I'm interested to have some advice really on where it would be sensible to deposit them really so that they're looked after.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Or in the interim period before I can persuade my husband to deposit them, how to go about concerning them.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Yes, that's right.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Well, you know, certainly Mike will be happy to tell you about that.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Can we have a look at them?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Yes, of course.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So how many are there in the series?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I think we've got about seven or eight.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And she only used small books.
