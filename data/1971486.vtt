00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
There's two headlands in Fishguard Bay.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.200
One is called Penanglas,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.480
which is the one that sticks out above the harbor.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.480
And the other one is called Dinus Island.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.360
And Dinus Island isn't an island,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.520
in fact, it's geological promontory.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.800
But it's, up there is a place where you could stop.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.200
You can take a bus there if you want to.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.200
It's a little village, pretty little village,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.720
but it's by the sea,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.040
famous for the fact that the church

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.640
and most of the village got washed away in a big storm

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.160
about a couple of years ago.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.400
So it's, what happened being washed away,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.080
it's a pretty place and it's also good for swimming.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.680
It's probably the best swimming spot in the area.
