00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
When you're two ready.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What is your full name?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Susan Elizabeth Cleary.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Do we have permission to record this interview?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yes you do.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Where and when were you born?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I was born in Cardiff, October 25th 1952.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
How did you meet Father Paul Zottori?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I met him when he was serving as a priest in the parish in Harroford West.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What's your earliest memory or memories of Father Zottori?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The earliest memories are probably because my husband was living in a flat in Harroford West.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
First time away from home he had as always gone to the Catholic Church to make himself known.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Our first memories of him were welcoming us into the parish.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Knowing that he liked to go out for a drink, he would go out for a drink sometimes with the boys.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Seeing him riding around Harroford West on his motorbike.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Thinking my goodness me this is more than a priest, this is a real bloke.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Our first meeting with him and getting to know him was as newcomers to the parish.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
When did you move to Harroford West?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Rory was there in 1974.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I joined him later after we got married in 1975.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So he really struck you as being unconventional for a priest?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Yes, very unconventional as a priest.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Someone who liked to mix with the young people, he was young himself really.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Someone who liked to mix with the young people, liked to get to know the young people.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Unconventional in as much as the things that he would say during mass led you to believe that he was so much more than just a priest.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000
That sounds silly. He was a human being first and foremost with his faults and his admissions to his faults.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I remember one occasion during a service he had berated the congregation because we had another priest there, a parish priest who was older and not as interesting.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
People would put their heads around the door and if they saw it was the older priest they would go away and come back when Father Sartori was saying mass.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
On one Sunday, oh my goodness me, he let rip. He said to us all, you do not come to church for the priest.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
He said you come to worship God.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We were all quaking in our seats but we didn't take any notice of him.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We still only went to listen to him preach because he was a good preacher.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Another occasion during a service which was one of the reasons why I felt that he was so much so human was it was during the consecration and he was literally holding the host up and he stopped.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And he looked at us and he said, how many of you actually believe this is the body of Christ?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And I was like, oh my gosh, you know, this is the priest asking us because he said, sometimes I don't believe it.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I doubt.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And he says, I have to work really hard at reminding myself of why I'm here and the importance of this moment in the service.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And it really hit home to me that here was a man who was not just a man, he was a priest who was able to say, it's not plain sailing.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
We all have doubts and it's OK.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And that as a young adult made me feel this is OK.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This is good. This is what the church should be about.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And that's that was one of his his strengths was bringing religion into your everyday life and making you feel that it was OK to have doubts.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And maybe some days you didn't think it was right.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And it was fine. It was OK.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And that helped me a lot with my faith as a young adult.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
We all struggle with, you know, is this the right thing to do?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Do we really want this anymore?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And he yeah, he really kept me in the church for a long time because of his philosophy and his way of reaching out to people and making making them feel that the mass was for them.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Church was for them. It wasn't just the priests and holy people and saints.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It was for everybody, you know.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So that was that was my experience of him in Haverford West.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Later on, I think I told you he married us.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And Rory and I were married in 1975 in Cardiff, which was where we were both from originally.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And our parish priest at the time agreed that Father Paul could actually come to Cardiff and marry us.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And now before the wedding, traditionally Rory had a stag night to which Father Paul went.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And on the day itself, June the 19th, 1975, July the 19th, I arrived at the church in the car and I was told by the usher, could you go around the block?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I thought, oh, crumbs, the groom hasn't arrived, you know, is it?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So off I go around the block.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Come back.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Could you go round again?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The priest hasn't turned up.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Oh, no.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
What I've got to do is driving up from Haverford West.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So I went around a third time.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And when I got there, there he was.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Bright as a ray of sunshine.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Hi, everything all right?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Yes.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Come on in.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And he was all robed up and into the church we went.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Lovely service.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
We got to the sermon.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And he said to the congregation, just sit down and talk among yourselves.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And he said, I've got to say it's only for Rory and Sue.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So we sat there with our backs to the congregation.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And, you know, I can't for the life of me remember what he said.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But all I know is he had us in fits of laughter.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And the congregation could just see our shoulders going up and down, up and down, laughing at whatever it was that he said to us.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But he didn't want to share it with the congregation, just for us.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
That was a nice little personal touch.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So that was my those are my main memories about Father Paul.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Later on, when he became sick, Rory had been moved to Swansea and he went to visit him in the hospital.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And of course, because of his illness, he was lying face down.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
It was very difficult to sort of converse with him.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Very tragic, very sad, great loss taken far too soon.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But I think in the short time that he was there, he touched the hearts of so many people.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And you'll know yourselves that that legend is still alive with all the Paul Sartori Foundation and all the charity shops.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And we were actually down in Tembe last Easter.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And we said, we're going to have a little ride into Nailyne and West.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Have a look around.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And we were in Nailyne and there was a Paul Sartori charity shop.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And I said, we've got to go in and we've got to buy something.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I don't care what it is.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
You've just got to go in.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And the lady in there, we told her that we knew him and she said, well, she didn't know him.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
She was too young to know him.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But she said the number of people who go into the shop just because they remember him and they just want to keep his memory alive,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
keep that foundation going, keep giving as he did, giving all the time.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Wonderful man.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Absolutely wonderful.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
How would you describe him as a person?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Fun, a little outrageous perhaps.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And kind.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I think the kindness and this, the willingness to get to know people, to take the time to talk to them, whether it was in the pub or after mass or whatever, he was, he always had time for people.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And I think those, I think the fun thing is the one thing I remember most.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
He liked to laugh.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
He liked a joke.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
He liked a bit of fun.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And he, yeah, he always was always smiling.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
You know, he was always a happy chappy.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Yeah, that's how I would describe him.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Thank you.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I think you've probably anticipated this to some extent, but do you have any other favorite stories about Father Paul?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.000
No, I think the two most, my two favorite were the wedding and the occasion at mass.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I think those are my absolute favorites.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Thank you.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And we always ask the interviewees, did Father Paul impact your life in some way?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Well, obviously he married you and your husband, so that's a fundamental influence.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Can you think of any other impact he might have had?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Sorry?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Can you think of any other impact he might have had?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Well, I think, as I said in the beginning, he kept me in the church.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
He kept my faith going for a long time, to time when perhaps, you know, a lot of young people would have been leaving the church, early 20s.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And, yeah, so that was an impact.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And I will never forget, you know, the things that he said.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And, you know, now, I mean, I did leave the church for a while.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I'm back.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And I often think about what he used to say.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And I think that's the biggest impact he's had on my life is my religion.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Really.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Okay, thank you.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And I know this is a difficult question, but if you could sum up Father Paul in three words, what would they say?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
What would they be?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Fun, as I said.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Unconventional, which was a word you used.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And sincere.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Thank you.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And is there anything, finally, else you'd like to mention?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I don't think so.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I think I've said everything that I need to.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Well, thank you.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Thank you so much.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So it's been really, really useful having you share your memories of Father Paul with us.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And very, very grateful.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And good to see you across the Irish Sea.
