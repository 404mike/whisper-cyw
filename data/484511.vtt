Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.200
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.100
Interviewee Dan Green.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.840
The location is the Swicker office

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.840
and today's date is the 9th of October 2015.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.540
Before we start Dan, would you very kindly,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.160
for the record, spell your name in four?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.000
No worries.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.160
Okay, D-A-N, Dan, and then Green, G-R-E-E-N.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.400
Excellent.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.720
Can you remember your first point of contact

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.160
with the Cardiff Carnival, which I would imagine

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.560
at that point was known as the Cardiff Mask Carnival?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.400
Yeah, it was.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.560
Okay, so for me it would be the early 90s.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.920
I can't specify exactly when,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.760
but it would be the early 90s.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.840
I was around about 13 or 14

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.680
and my father was involved with it.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.760
I think he led it.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.200
My father, Frank Rosalind Green,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.560
he was, past tense,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.060
he was an actor performer.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.680
I would still say he's a performer now.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.760
So he's definitely on that side of the camera search

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.960
and definitely an outward sort of dancer as well, performer.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.680
He led it as his clown name, Franco Pissetti,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.040
white-faced clown.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.040
I remember he had a, I think I'm right in saying,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.320
he had a red star, so he was leading it

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.320
like sort of an old Orleans sort of funeral,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.160
it felt like.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.760
And so he was at the very, very front as a young man

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.640
or young boy watching that.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.960
That stuck in my mind.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.640
And yeah, and I think I followed him.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.800
As the clown, I would actually step away from him,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.080
but follow him and watch him interact.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.920
And he was fantastic doing that.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.280
But also the century overload of all the colors,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.120
all the nations, all the sort of flamboyancy

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.320
and celebration of these different people,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.480
that stuck in my memory.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.960
And like I said, I was quite a young guy

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.480
and I remember, yeah, he was going down Butte Street

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.560
and then going into the Hays, I think.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.320
I think I went through the Hays in the center of Cardiff.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.760
So yeah, that was my very first recollection of it.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.440
And then it wasn't two years later.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.040
I remember going down quite often just to watch it.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.920
And then I developed, I got into photography

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.440
when I was about 15, 16.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.720
So it's sort of the end of school time

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.840
and I did a few courses.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.040
It was just a prime target really.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.520
This happens every year in Cardiff.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.960
It was a fantastic opportunity to take photographs

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.120
in black and white, but more so in color.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.880
So I got into it around about the millennium,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.280
around about 2004, 2005.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.240
I then started taking photographs of the carnival.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.320
I remember the blue devils,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.320
loads of kids dressed up as blue devils.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.360
And being allowed by the Swicker crew

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.320
to go beyond the barrier, which is quite nice.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.400
I didn't want to wear a yellow fluorescent jacket,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.560
but they allowed me to go in there and interact as well.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.520
So that was really key to have that license

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.400
to take these intimate photographs

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.400
as they were performing, et cetera, or doing the procession,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.920
but also going there early enough to get the people

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.960
setting up and all those months and weeks of preparation

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.960
to get to that point.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.160
Going there early as a photographer was fantastic

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.160
to get that anticipation, that excitement, that buzz,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.360
but also catch them preparing themselves

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.840
for the long day ahead.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.560
And yeah, that was extra special.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.280
And then from there, I would say, wow.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.680
I would say from about 2007 onwards,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.560
every year I photographed it,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.480
I didn't photograph it one year,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.720
can't remember exactly which one, maybe 2012,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.120
because I twisted my ankle and I was devastated.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.120
So, and now I'm a photographer and project organizer,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.120
arts project organizer.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.000
I've been working with Swicker for, god, for quite a while.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.320
Yeah, for a long time.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.800
And some of the best shots that we have,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.000
and of course these will be seen on our online archive

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.040
when it's launched, the People's Collection Wales.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.960
You were very interested in portraiture, weren't you,

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.200
at one point, and the human face.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.360
And it was quite nice because you were catching

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.760
the carnival faces, which are often covered in sequins,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.960
or just transformed.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.240
But also then I noticed that you started then

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.880
capturing those same faces after the parade,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.680
when they'd been through the blood, sweat, and tears.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.200
And that flamboyant,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.720
mirror had cracked to some degree

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.160
and the humanity was shining through even more so.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.720
Yeah, and not only that, when it was raining,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.480
so their makeup was really sinister,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.280
but they were smiling,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.840
so that sometimes made it look even more sinister.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.840
But yeah, that was great.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.040
And I had that style of getting in close.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.080
So my criticism as a photographer

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.320
was to step back and look around you.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.720
So I started to do that a bit more,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.280
but I would really want to get in close.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.960
So it was more about filling the frame

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.480
and seeing the exuberance through the eyes, really.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.400
So I was into that a lot, and eventually I did back off.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.280
But like I said, it was going there early enough

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.640
to get the preparation and to have that license

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.080
to take these intimate shots.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.800
But also the person's confidence in me

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.640
to take that photograph and recognize who I was.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.680
So it wasn't as if you would go in, do the job, go out.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.160
So I don't think photography is too much like that, really.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.200
And you've got two hours of window opportunity,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.680
you come in, out you go.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.040
Sometimes that makes perfect sense, fine.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.240
But for the carnival, it would be wake up early,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.120
get loads of food inside you, take cereal bars with you,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.920
and you know it's gonna be a seven, eight hour job.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.600
And same for the people in it,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.200
because they had to be full of energy,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.880
they had to keep going.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.880
And obviously you've got people around you

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.000
inspiring you to keep going

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.640
and the motivation to keep going.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.120
But you'd have pigs and troughs who'd dip in energy.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.800
But yeah, there was surges.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.640
And as we talked about, I would sometimes sit down

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.440
and then just take it in five minutes,

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.560
then stand back up and go back into it.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.440
Because you would run up and down,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.280
well I would anyway, run up and down with the carnival

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.400
and trying to get certain shots that you wanna,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.440
you didn't plan out, but there's certain iconic shots

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.840
you wanted to get with a certain background

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.480
that was noticed firebly is in Cardiff and what have you.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.400
But also just to be in the right place at the right time.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.120
And also you had to, within that, relax

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.360
because there's a lot going on

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.360
and you can't capture everything.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.920
And as I developed it as a photographer,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.920
and more photographers were involved in Swicker,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.160
it was nice seeing what they were doing,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.960
what I was doing and then trying to,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.040
so for the archives, trying to do something different.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.280
So there was a collection at the end

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.360
of the carnival of the whole picture.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.040
So it was nice to not work with,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.360
but to see what other photographers were doing

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.080
to then capture the full story, like I said.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.560
So yeah, it's a photographer's dream.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.440
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.640
An absolute photographer's dream.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.280
And big smiley faces and amazing,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.560
amazing elaborate costumes.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.080
And the fact that every nation was there.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.080
It was a, Cardiff and Britain is a melting pot

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.120
and it showed off that and showcased that

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.400
and it was a beautiful thing.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.720
Of course, for our Cardiff Carnival

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.320
25th anniversary exhibition of the Cardiff story,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.720
you brought a new element of your,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.520
because it seems to me that,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.480
well, I imagine all photographers are creative,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.880
but you seem to be at the forefront of many things

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.880
in terms of the use of the image.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.080
Would you care to tell us a bit about

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.440
what you did for the exhibition

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.800
and indeed what you've been doing recently in Uganda,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.200
which I just, yeah, there we go.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.400
You can explain them.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.840
Absolutely, so it was nice to go back to the Cardiff story

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.160
in 2011, did an exhibition there called Big Little City,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.520
which was a celebration of Cardiff's creative talents

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.480
and Swicker was involved in that

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.880
and that was a milestone for the sort of creative work

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.360
I've done, I think.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.160
But then again, it was nice to return there in 2014,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.520
yeah, 2014, to work with Swicker.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.520
And we had, I was assigned three,

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.920
I'll repeat that now.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.760
Sorry.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.600
Sorry.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.800
Good old coffee.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.080
And Steve's gone.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.440
I'll carry on.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.280
Carry on.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.920
Yeah, so yeah, in 2000,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.640
so it was nice to return to the Cardiff story in 2014

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.280
after that exhibition I did in 2011.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.360
And I was asked to do a big mural

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.040
of the different work I've done

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.400
and photographs I've done for Swicker.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.200
And I worked with Mark Heatley, who's a designer,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.520
he's a good friend and designer,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.240
I've worked with many, many times, myself.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.520
And we came up with a really, really, really large

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.520
paste-up of this, it's almost Sergeant Pepper-esque

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.640
mishmash cutouts all jumbled together,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.200
collage of the different kind of photographs

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.200
from round about 2005, 2006 onwards.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.360
And I wanted to include lots of other photographers,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.600
but it was just finding the high-resolution images

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.640
all in one place,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.120
because it was printing really, really large,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.280
so therefore the quality had to be.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.000
In terms of scale, how big was that?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.600
Well, it was, if I'm right in saying it was two,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.240
I remember, that's weird,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.640
it was 280 high, but then 15 meters wide.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.640
So it wrapped around half of the wall space upstairs

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.480
in the Calle Astoria, in the old ivy building.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.080
So yeah, 15 meters long, about three meters high.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.920
That is big.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.760
It was massive.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.920
It was a huge statement, lovely.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.920
It was, and it was a nice backdrop to what was a really,

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.080
I'm not just saying this, because I was involved in it,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.480
but it was a really coherent, clear, welcoming,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.480
friendly celebration of Swicker's 25-year anniversary.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.160
Really sort of resummed it up perfectly as well.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.400
And I think it was a nice addition

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.400
to the quite cleanly sort of situated and placed artifacts

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.840
and history of Swicker.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.160
It's gotta be the liveliest imagery

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.400
and scale of artwork I've ever seen.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.720
So I'm smiling all over my face just thinking about that.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.560
Yeah.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.720
And of course, you've recently returned from Uganda,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.040
where I think you've been using some of the same processes

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.880
with the SAFE Foundation.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.200
I don't know if you can say a little bit more

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.440
about your current practice.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.280
Absolutely.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.240
SAFE Foundation are a local NGO,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.840
so they're based in Bari and Cardiff,

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.680
and they do projects all over the world,

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.280
mainly with small communities that need the help.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.720
So a lot of health, a lot of education, et cetera, et cetera.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.880
You can see more type in the SAFE Foundation.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880
You can find out more.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.960
I've basically been a photographer since 2010.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.680
Been lucky enough to go to different countries

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.160
and document the projects they do.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.160
But just come back from Uganda,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.920
it was the last, oh God, three weeks ago,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.920
two and a half weeks ago,

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.920
where we were there to build clay ovens

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.720
in a small community in Tororo in Uganda.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.200
Clay ovens which they can bake bread

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.040
and cook food within it.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.160
So we constructed them.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.600
What was really nice that we went there

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.680
and it was a completed job,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.600
as opposed to going in making something happen,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.560
but it never quite, it came to the end

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.160
and never quite finished the project or what have you.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.520
This was completely done,

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.840
and the onus is on the builders who watched us

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.080
and were taught how to make it to make more.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.440
And also the onus is on the community to actually use them.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.160
So it's a handover and it's a job well done all around.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.720
So it was a pat on the back for everyone really.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.040
But it's, like I say,

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.160
I've been on different community projects

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.360
where you go over there and it wasn't quite complete

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.200
and then you leave it

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.240
and then you come back in the same as you left it.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.080
So that was nice.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.320
And on top of that,

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.080
I went round photographing as well,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.800
different communities, different people.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.640
That's my main thing, photographing people.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.000
And then found a printer in the capital, Kampala,

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.840
would send the images over there, send them back,

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.080
print them up in large scale,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.320
and then glue and paste them onto the walls

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.920
where they were taken originally.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.560
So you gave photography back to the communities

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.920
as opposed to taking the images and taking it back with you.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.280
I'm not gonna sell the image.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.680
The images were then are gonna be put

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.880
on the Safe for Nation website

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.840
to create more of a, promote what they do

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.960
and to get more people involved

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.640
and to get more money for the community.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.280
So there's no actual commercial gain

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.560
as a photographer doing that.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.680
But it was a lovely way to put work back on the wall

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.320
and celebrate them there and there.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.680
So that's been, yeah, that's what I'm into at the moment

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.840
is to go to different places, photograph,

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.600
but then leave the image behind for them

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.120
and make them the celebrity,

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.800
make them the ones that should be celebrated.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.640
Yes.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.400
I mean, I've seen a number of these images

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.240
on social media.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.960
The one that sticks in my mind,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.800
and they gladden the heart,

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.520
the one outstanding image for me

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.800
is the elderly lady, the grandmother,

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.280
who is then photographed next to her giant size image

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.920
and the look on her face, ripped big.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.720
And I was thinking like, wow, that is just,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.840
all human life is there.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.000
A lot of people have commented on that.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.280
And coincidentally, the people I was staying with,

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.520
that was her sister, I had no idea.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.040
She's a 94 year old woman.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.880
I was putting it up

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.120
and she arrived with a walking stick.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.800
It was a perfect moment.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.640
Wish I had it on film,

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.280
but I was too busy gluing it on the wall.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.640
But yeah, that was special, is special.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.080
This is all influenced by a French artist called JR.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.040
I can't take this sole credit for this.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.560
And it's this sort of wave of doing that sort of work,

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.320
but not having any sponsorship on there

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.960
and just having a photograph of the person.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.840
But I'm also now working with different artists.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.880
So therefore we can create things.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.880
It's not just a photograph,

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.240
it could be a painted background mural, what have you.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.800
So we're working on that.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.360
And the next thing I'm doing in Cardiff on Lauda Road

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.920
is a celebration of the work I did in Uganda

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.880
and then photographing that, sending it back to Uganda.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.280
And in the Tororo region in Uganda,

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.520
they want me to come back and do more work,

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.360
which was lovely.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.720
And not just that, headmasters and nurses, doctors,

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.040
peers of the community are writing letters for me

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.560
of support to come back.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.960
And I'm trying to work out a way of raising money here,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.720
taking some artists over there

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.440
and doing the same sort of work, but on a larger scale.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.560
So that's where I'm heading, hopefully.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.320
But by initially going over there and doing it,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.760
the response was fantastic.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.720
They fully embraced it.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.120
I wasn't quite sure how they were gonna take it,

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.640
but it's all gone the right way.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.040
Well done, Dan. Thank you.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.920
Talking of things that perhaps

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.520
haven't quite gone the right way recently.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.360
Here we go.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.120
Yeah, go on, I'm ready.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.160
Okay, just over two weeks ago,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.000
the sole funder of Swickr Carnival,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.800
the Arts Council of Wales,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.280
announced the results of its investment review

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.280
and decided that Swickr would not be receiving

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.440
any public investment to keep going

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.480
from April 2006 onwards at the latest.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.160
Obviously, a massive disappointment

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.600
from all those involved and yet to be involved.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.440
Excuse me.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.560
Dan, what was your reaction when I told you

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.440
and explained the situation this morning?

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.480
Coincidentally, I was in Uganda when I saw it.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.600
Oh, right, right.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.360
And someone sent me the link on social media

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.360
when I finally got a bit of internet.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.200
I couldn't believe it.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.720
It's a travesty.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.240
It really, really is.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.360
I know I'm emotionally connected to this

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.240
and it is a sort of family, the Swickr group.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.560
And so I'm gonna be highly biased,

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.080
but even away from that and stepping aside from that,

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.840
if I remember being going,

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.400
harking back to the beginning of this interview

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.360
when I first saw the carnival,

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.800
yes, I was emotionally involved as well

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.160
because my father was part of it,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.640
but seeing the carnival, being part of it,

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.480
being a onlooker, not being sort of

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.160
on the other side of the barrier, watching the audience,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.240
it is a travesty for the community.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.240
It's part of what Cardiff is to me, to be honest,

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.600
right from young age, really, throughout the 80s as well.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.680
And it's just, it is a crime, to be honest.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.520
It really is.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.640
I'm not here to have a go at the Arts Council,

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.320
not here to have a go at the governing bodies.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.240
I just think it's so worthwhile to keep going.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.360
And I can't imagine the first weekend of August

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.200
in not being here, and that sounds really selfish,

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.400
but I think the whole city would really miss it.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.280
But not only that, beyond that,

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.360
I used to love what happened in Swansea.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.320
I thought that was a great carnival, and that stopped.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.360
And then at Festival Number Six in recent years,

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.280
that's been fantastic, and imagine that not happening.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.280
So it's a real, it's a weird emotion, really,

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.120
because it's part of the parcel,

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.640
it's the makeup of the city.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.680
It's like taking away the castle.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.040
It's really weird.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.600
That's part of the human landscape

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.880
of Cardiff is the carnival, for me.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.080
Not just for me, I'm sure for lots and lots of people.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.880
So to see it not here anymore, I can't imagine it.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.640
And imagine not a whole carnival not existing.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.400
Imagine St. Paul's Carnival not existing.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.320
It's just, you can't really imagine it.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.320
So it's, yeah, it's a really bizarre one.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.520
And yeah, we will see what happens.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.560
But it's bizarre.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.040
I'm in the office right now, and I'm surrounded by,

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.080
you know, it's sort of like a graveyard to the carnival.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.920
It shouldn't be.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.760
It's got to be.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.240
Funny enough, yesterday, because it was distressing me,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.640
I took down all the photographs.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.480
I couldn't bear to see any human face.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.320
Yeah, there are no photographs.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.160
I couldn't bear it.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.400
Yesterday, I suddenly realized what was,

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.640
I look at a huge emotional blockage to me.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.760
I couldn't bear to see any human faces in here anymore.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.000
So that was me yesterday.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.840
But that's it.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.840
Sorry, but that's not the story.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.680
You're right.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.520
This is the human element.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.600
It's, you know, it's evolved.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.000
It's evolved with the times.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.760
It's incorporated all the different communities

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.960
within Cardiff.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.360
It's been completely open to anybody and everybody.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.480
It's been accommodating.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.440
It's all the flipping, sorry, it's ticking all the boxes.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.520
This is the annoying thing.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.760
This ticks all the boxes.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.360
So why isn't it being backed?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.880
I know this financial climate.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.360
Well, I know where we all are, but it's,

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:27.280
I don't understand the benefit of not having it.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.840
I understand the benefit of having it.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.040
So where's the arguments?

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.280
Who makes these decisions?

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.800
And why is this the case?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.640
It is a travesty.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.480
It really is.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.920
It ain't over till it's over.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.000
I'm sure in some form in the future,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
it has to come back in some form

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
because this is embedded in the culture.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.640
It's like stripping, it's weird.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.560
It's a weird, I'm lost for words.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.400
There you go.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.120
It's hard to put into words what I really think about it.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.400
And it's,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.520
it's,

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.160
it just can't imagine it not existing.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.120
On a more positive,

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:14.960
Yes, sorry, wait.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.120
Oh, anyway.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.520
Can I take this opportunity to award you

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.520
the nominal and unbankable, but invisible and untractable.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.120
I'd like to award you the,

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.880
you are a Cardiff Carnival hero.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.400
Dan Green, thank you very, very much for all.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.040
And it's been a joy having you as part of the Swicker family

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.440
and bless you for capturing all those wonderful moments

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.680
from past carnivals.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.880
Dan Green, you're a star.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.720
Thank you very much.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.560
Thank you very much.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.400
Top, top, top.
