WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So thank you again for coming back in for a second time.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yeah, just really grateful to have you here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So my first question is, can you tell me about your experience of coming to Wales?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Oh, my experience coming to Wales, it's really nice to place this one.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Wales, especially where I live right now and the town where I live right now.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's more of a family-oriented, community-oriented place.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You have easy access to the beautiful beaches here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You have easy access to... I mean, where I am is in town.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I could easily access everywhere I want to go.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And that is more important to me because I'm a single mom.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I don't drive. So that is really essential to me as well.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:13.000
To roam around without being restricted or being deprived of where you want to go, bringing your child to different places to explore and to learn heritage and culture here as well.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So is that different from other places you've lived in terms of being able to walk around?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Where I lived before in Dubai, you have also freedom there.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Dubai is not like the other country that they said you are deprived to do something.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
No, Dubai is an open country also. So you are able to do the worst.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
But it's different when Dubai is a more desert place.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But this one, I now understand the balance of me living in a desert place and then coming down here in Wales where you got...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The beautiful thing about this, I always joke with my friends, the beautiful thing here, you got the four seasons in one day.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You got the sunny day, you got the rainy day, you got the windy day, you got the autumn, except the winter.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But you got the autumn, the sunny and the spring in just one day here in Wales.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You got the sunny, you got the rain, you got the wind.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So you can't ask for more for that.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And you want to go to the beaches. So it's nice, it's accessible.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You want to go by bus.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:40.000
For me, it's very important to me that I'm able to explore different places in my own comfortable time, in my own way.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
That I don't have to rely on me driving, looking for parking.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It's very, very essential for me as a mother to bring my child accessible to these different places.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
That she able to learn also to maneuver in the country.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Growing up and she was able to maneuver on her own, use the public transportation and learning about the places here.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
That's one thing for me, it's really important.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Great.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about your experience of coming to Wales?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
My experience to Wales when it comes to culture.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Wales people are very, I say, talkative.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
They're very friendly, not talkative in a bad way, but talkative.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
When you try to communicate, they will inform you in a way they can.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
They're very accommodating.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
That's the difference.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
My experience and also my experience in some Midlands places, they see you as your color.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
But here, I feel more safer here.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I feel more freedom here.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That's the really important thing that I can express myself here.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I don't feel like, how do you say it, I don't feel like I'm reserved.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I'm being a love note here.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I'm able to say what I like to say.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I'm able to express what I like to do.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I'm able to showcase my talent here.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I'm able to showcase my painting here.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And they are embracing.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Simple painting, they accept it, put it.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
That's the only place that I've done what you call this one.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I've experienced that kind of, you know, it puts you like you are included, you know, not an outcast.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
That's the right term.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
You feel included in the community, not an outcast.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
That's so nice to hear.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Thank you.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I'm really glad that's your experience.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
That's really, really kind of magical to hear actually.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
You mentioned painting.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Yeah.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Could you tell us more about that?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Oh, I do some painting and I showcase it to different painting gallery that they do exhibit there.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Some of my painting got sold, but this time I said I don't want it to be sold.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I don't want it to be in auction.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
What I wanted right now is that I wanted people to see this one, to see it, more people to see it.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
There's one person who could have it.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm glad somebody liked my painting, but this time I wanted more to be reaching people, you know, to see the different culture or background with my painting.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So they've learned that this is what they can picture what is in my painting.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Yeah, for example, if I paint the beautiful scenery of a rice field, the beautiful scenery of a sunset on the rice field, so they would they would picture that this person because it's because I know selling a painting is nice.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
But I was thinking it's a part of me.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
It's an extension of me.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Those paintings that I have is an extension of me.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So I wanted to be displayed only.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So a lot of people could see it, not just one person in their house could see it.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I understand that I appreciate that they like their painting.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
But I want it now.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
This time I've learned I don't I don't want selling it.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I don't want the value of the money anymore.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I want it more reaching people, you know, because one time I was in the background.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I was in the I was in the gallery.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And there are people there that was standing in my painting and I was there.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
They didn't know who was the painter of that.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So I was just on the back.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And I said most of my paintings said angels.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So it's anonymous.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So they said, oh, this painting is so vibrant.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The color is rich, they said.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And this like the person who paint this one has a lot of has a lot of color.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You can feel, they said, you can feel the vibe of this person with this greenery color and then this silhouette sunset on the painting.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And they said you can feel the person, you know, you can understand the person feeling with this one.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So I was on the back listening to this one and they said it's refreshing.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
At the same time, it makes you think deeper on that painting.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So I said, and then I said, so it it it give them something like, you know, something to think, you know, I remember the girl said when that when that painting was being showcased.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And then I said, I think it was I forgot the date, but I'm pretty sure that on that time that painting when that painting was was being shown, I said to I said to myself.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I said to myself, now I don't want to sell it because see they they they how is it like I see the painting they they take the part of the paint.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:09:02.000
How you say I don't know how to explain that, but it's like they the person looking on on your painting, they captivated by your feeling.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So it not this only the painting, but they feel you.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
That's that's one thing that I've never thought that they could feel through my painting.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
They could feel the first the one who painted it.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And she was she was she was right when she said this person was having these two paintings together, the green scenery and the lush of this painting.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And then the sunset. It's she she have this this positive thing of the better future.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And yet you have this she have this painting of you know of of of what's called this one of her of her mind, you know.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.000
So I said I said how on earth they they could they could they could think on that way.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I mean, in though in some of the painting that they could analyze, that's the right word to my painting, they could analyze the feeling of the of the painter or how she was trying or what she was feeling when she's painting it.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Because that that was to I paint because me when I feel sad, my granddad, me and my granddad, and if I for example, come on, if I got scold by my mom or if my mom doing something or my dad doing something and and they want to, you know, and then my dad said, come on, come on, don't mess with your dad.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Let's do painting or don't get upset. Let's do painting now.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So that's what's exactly what's what they make me the reason why I start painting is that when I feel upset or when I want to boost my my mood, I go in painting, then I feel relaxed, then I feel better, then I then I then my mood change, then I can express myself on the painting, then I'm not things that I'm not able to say I'm able to speak, I'm able to do it.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I'm able to do it on my painting. It's like it's an extension of my thought. My painting is extension of my thought. That's exactly how how how how I how I do painting. That's why this time I don't I tell to them to I don't want to sell it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I just I want people to see that and reach that and see interpret how they want to interpret it. And if they see good in it, and then I want them to see the good in it and apply it to them.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
You know, yeah. Beautiful. Thank you.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I'm so curious to see one of your paintings.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I can see one.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
This is the one that was been displayed.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
This is the one that been sold.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
This is the one that was been sold.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:04.000
That one. But I show it to you where it was been. I think I take picture of it.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I wanted to do abstract as well.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Abstract is when I wanted my daughter to, to, to paint.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And I wanted to learn the abstract way.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
This one.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And it was the first time they said that invited me to to paint for it.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I to to display for it.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I said, Oh, I don't think so.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
It's the you know, it will be like good to sell or like that.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And she said to me, Oh, good to I don't know somebody would like like to see it.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
No, no, no. Just put it in.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And I've never thought it would be like sold.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I was even I was even shocked that it was been sold.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Got lots of picture, but I could find it.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And most of it, the two that was in the exhibit.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I screen shot it.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I remember I screen shot it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And some of the paintings also that I did is I give it.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I make it as a gift.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I'm wondering with the.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
You just told me about painting and why you like painting, what painting gives you.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So this is some of my favorite things.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
This one.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
This one's dying.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And this one.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And there's another one.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
But this is what the one back home.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Before I left, I did some painting there.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But the one that I paint here when I when I stay in Wales.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
This one.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Yeah, so that's the one when I stood.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
That was exactly where it was placed.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So I was behind them and I was listening to their conversation when they're looking at this one.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:44.000
You said you see the rich color of this, you know, and then next to it, you see the the the person who was

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.000
feeling of this one having this silhouette picture, the silhouette painting.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000
She was the one when she said to me, when you are free, can you send me a text to go with the picture?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Yeah, so because when I said, but I wanted it, I wanted it on the back of the painting, I said.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
But I don't want it to be in in the in the painting in front of the painting, but I want it to be in the back.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So that's my logo there.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
It's an angel.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
My name is then the angel ring.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Yeah, so that's that was the one that I was standing and then, oh, she they how on earth they would analyze the the because you can see two different.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
The rich vibrant color of the green, you know, and then this one.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But I when I explain this to them, this is the rice field of my granddad.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000
This is the rice field where I grew up and this is this tiny house is the rice field on that.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:57.000
So people were after their work, after their work, after they're doing all the rice field working, they stay on that one.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
They drink, they dance, they play guitar.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
They watch that sun, you know, they watch the silhouette there because that were exactly where the where you can see the sun.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Where you can see the sun goes down.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000
That exactly the place where that house that NEPA house is located.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And that exactly when I when I when I paint this one, I picture of my granddad.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I picture the time that I've spent with my granddad and the place that he he he gave to us.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000
You know, this this is the land that he gave to my parents, you know, to my from my ancestral.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000
So when this one when I stood here said what they when they asked me what was the what was the concept of the painting?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
You have to give me what was said.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:17:00.000
No, we want you to showcase a place where you where you are where you are like your happy place or like your memorable place.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And then that's what I that's this is the painting that I did on that time that I said this is where my childhood mostly and my my whenever whenever not my whole childhood.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:23.000
But whenever I go to the province with my granddad, this is where the happiest place that I am stayed in the province with my granddad.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
That's that's that's exactly the one said.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
So this this silhouette, people stay staying there.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:52.000
People might those farmers staying there just to drink and sip their coffee or their their their native the you know, native liquor to back just to just to watch this one and lost in the space, you know, lost in time.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And then they just go home with relaxing with with with feeling even the whole day work.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:12.000
But seeing this kind of scenery after work and having just a simple food and they go home relaxed, they're not tired, able to to to feel comfortable.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:20.000
I could able to bring happiness in their home, you know, that exactly how I feel because they go home.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
They get a little bit down.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
They laughing.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
They are the wife sitting next to the husband.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
My grandma was sitting next to my granddad, just watching and talking, you know, playing the guitar and all that stuff.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:47.000
So it's really, really one of the plays that if I think if I look at this, it makes me it makes my heart like filled with air.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
You know, that's how I could say it.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
It's like I I was filled with air, you know, whenever I look at this one, I feel happy.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I feel fond about it.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Yeah, it's wonderful.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Thank you.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
One of my questions was, can you describe a place or a time in your life that's important to you?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
This this feels like.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Yeah, it's yes.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Yes, it's one of the important.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
It's one of the important.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:21.000
And then it's it's very ironic because they said, what is the most one of the most important place to you?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I always say it's home, you know, home, because I always think that I've never come from a broken family.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:39.000
So I grew up with a family, though I came from an arranged marriage.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
But before that happened, I grew up in a in a house that that I have a mom, I have a dad.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
You know, I grew I wake up in the morning.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I have my mom and I have my dad.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I know my dad was working for but I know I have a family.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
That's really one thing for me.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
You know, very important thing to me that I grew up with.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
I have a home and I have a family.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Yeah.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
So what does home mean to you now?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Is it still that memory of being being younger or when you think of home, do you think of where you live now?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Or to be honest with you, I still think of back home as my home.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
But at the moment, we are we are living here.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
I pick it because I said my second home is Dubai.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:42.000
And now that I live here because Dubai never never did the I've never had the bad bad bread with Dubai.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
I've always loved I've always want to come back there and go back there.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:52.000
But right now, where my daughter is where our home now, you know, where we're struggling, where we're starting to have our home.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
It's like we're starting to have a life again.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:06.000
You know, we have a home, we have a family, but now it's like you're building your new home again.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
You know, Wales for me is also I could consider it as a comfortable home for me as well.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
You know, that is also Wales for me.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I feel I feel I told you I feel I don't feel outcasted here.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I feel like I'm I'm included.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:34.000
I feel like I'm important, especially when when they say, oh, Angel, we are going to have an exhibit and one of your painting was being chosen to put in there.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
You know, like they don't need to do that one.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.000
They don't. But, you know, to feel included in something, it's like it's it's make your heart fond, isn't it?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
You know, it makes it makes you give good mood.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:59.000
You know, that's that's because I did painting, but I put my painting on the in to give it to a friend or give it to.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
I don't really keep some of my paintings.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:10.000
But when I came to Wales, I didn't know Wales or England, the whole England, love art.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
I didn't know that one. The whole especially Wales, they have an art museum here.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I didn't know that one, that I have I that one of my painting was being chosen and that one of some of my painting was being sold.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:33.000
I never thought of it, you know, that, oh, I could I could I could be I could my painting could be included.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
You know, I thought it's just for the big, you know, big people who have likes.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Though I don't use I don't use all painting.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:56.000
I use acrylic. You know, some some some people they said all painting is more valuable, you know, but me using acrylic painting and then people able to appreciate it.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And when I do the texture painting and people said that when they feel it, they feel the hand of the painter.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:25.000
And that's that's that's what makes me my heart, you know, fun like, oh, my Lord, how on earth they could do my painting, they could express the the the the and they could explain or they how I feel or what they see through my painting.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:40.000
So they could like it's like the soul, you know, it's like it's like it's if all my painting is this the they looking to my soul, they look at their inner inner inner part of you.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000
That's how I feel about it, because it's not only one time to time that I stand behind my painting and some people were standing on it.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.000
And they said, oh, it's somebody would like, is this for sale? Is this for sale? So no, it wasn't included in the sale.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Yeah. And then one of my painting was it was in the big wall, but my painting, they put it on the middle because the story stands the story of that that painting stand.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:31.000
So I was I was really shocked that they picked that one. And I said, I feel privileged and I feel honored that all the big painting, it was my painting that was being put in the middle because the story of it was captivating.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Yeah. And so I'm one of that one was sold in auction and that was been taken. That's why this time I want it. No, I'm not going to sell it. I just let people enjoy to look at it.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Yeah. It's amazing. I'm wondering if you remember from last time that with this interview, there'll be one long recording.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Yeah. So someone edit me out now, for example, so someone can just hear your long story, you know, your long version.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Yeah. But then I'll also take some small bits out to make something called a digital story. Yeah.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Which if you come on the 19th, we'll be showing some of those. And that's a type of storytelling where you have some images and then you have the person's voice on video.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
And I think it would be wonderful if we could have a picture of some of your paintings. Sure, sure. Definitely.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000
To have as the image and then you talking about the audio would be you talking about what painting means to you. Yes, yes, yes.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:43.000
And how important it is to be included because your message is that everyday people need to be included in the arts too. Yeah, exactly.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:51.000
You know, making space and how rewarding it can be. Yeah, it is. It is. It is. To get your identity back. Yeah, it is. It is.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Actually, that's what I said that I feel like I'm starting to be whole again through my painting and through it, I could express myself and people who look at it see through to that.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:23.000
And they could like, I don't understand how I explain it, but the way they see it and the way I stand on the back of them and the way they talk of it, like they can see that the they can see through your soul.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Like they can just feel you from your painting. And that's magical for me that how a painting could boost one feeling or could boost one thought and could go into the deeper thought of somebody.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Because if you just look, it's just a painting, you know, it's just a painting. But some people have a deeper thought when it comes to painting and that other people are those people that talking about the painting, that people don't appreciate the art, the painting.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:25.000
You know, different, different art. So those people who could explain the art on that and give their personal personal opinion, personal perspective on that painting is like having a window of the personality of the painter.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:46.000
They can assess, they can picture it on how the painter could feel. And then it like some, because it said this one lighten your mood and this one like gives you in a deeper thought.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Because what exactly the lady said, this painting of a silhouette gives you in the deeper thought of the painter. If you could look on the picture she said to me, as she said to her friend that it's like she is, you know, the person who paint this one is very rich and deep thought.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:29.000
With her color, color combination, the color combination that she used is also different with the rice field. The combination of the color is totally different. I said, oh, maybe these people are really, they are used of looking on the painting.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Because very, very rare you see the comment, you see comment like that on the painting of anyone could comment on the painting. But that to a specific person, I wanted to, I wanted to come to them, you know, I wanted to approach them.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:29:05.000
But I just, I just said I have to, you know, hold myself because they would know I wanted to be, I wanted to be anonymous with all the painting I wanted to run on. That's why I never put my real name on it. I just put Angel on it.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Yeah. So that's, that's really, that's really one thing that I wanted that you can, it's either you can, you can see different meaning. There's always different meaning in painting. It's not just that paint and like that. It's just that picture, no.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Even some photographs, because I love photography. I do, I did study photography for six months, but I only finished three months because when my ex-partner died. But I said in photography also, I like the subject like silhouette, like landscape.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Same, see when I do my painting, I like it to be silhouette and, and I like it to be silhouette and landscape and rice field or anything that landscape.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:26.000
And so my photography exit, it's the extension of my, of my, of my painting. Like I also wanted to capture from my lenses the scenery of the, the scenery of silhouette. And I have one here, but that picture I kept it because it captivate me also. I think it's still here.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
It's in one of my, I don't know if it's here.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
This one is one of that.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
That's lovely.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
That's, that's one of that. And

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
That one.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Oh, that's lovely. That's beautiful.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
And where is that?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:22.000
That was in the island of Malapasca. They all, this is all the, yeah, in the Philippines. That's when I took photo of this one. I have also few, but I think it's on my, on my memory stick. Yeah. But this one, I've, this one is memorable to me because those people that was the streaming, that one is

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:41.000
is my children. You know, they are my family, my daughter. This is my daughter that's there. And then my son was over there. So when I take this one, so nobody knows who were that. But you see the boat, you see, but

00:31:41.000 --> 00:32:06.000
one thing you're gonna think of, who was the person in that, you know, like who were those person and you see the catching people in the, in the, in the sun, what you call the sunset and the race to the, the race goes to the water and then wandering.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Those people were in this picture had, had real people, you know, that's the one thing that from the photography. You're catching real people. Your story is real. You know, that day is real. You can't lie about photography that when you captured it, you know, that that day it was real. That day it was happened.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:57.000
So that's what exactly what I'm, I'm trying that I catch this when, when this person, when the person is that is my family. So I also, I also paint one of this one, but I put it on my, my, my mom's house, but it was banished by the, it was banished by the Yolanda.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:25.000
You know, when the typhoon reached Yolanda. Yeah. So that's why I, I reposted on my, on my, my Facebook, like profile picture, because I've lost that painting. So I said, it's, it's okay, because I still have the picture of it. I might lost the painting. I might lost the picture, but I have the original picture of it. That's why I keep it as my profile picture.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Yeah.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000
So you told me a bit about how painting makes you feel when you're doing photography. How does that make you feel?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:58.000
It's the same, actually. It's the same. It's just that when, when, when you do it, when you capture it from the lens, you are caught on that time. When you are on the painting, you are, you have your minds and live up.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:27.000
And I want to call this one. Your space is wild. You don't have, when, when you catch in the photography, you're just focusing on that specific with your lens. But in the painting, you are, your space is unlimited. It's, it's like the universe, you know, that you can put everything on your painting.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Unlimited. There's, there's no, there's no nothing, you know, you can continue putting it, you know, in painting. Once you capture it, that's it. That's it. You cannot edit it. You cannot put it. I know you can photoshop it, but what I mean is to see the real picture, to showcase the real picture.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:16.000
That's it. You capture that moment. But in painting, you have very wide imagination. Your imagination is unlimited. It's the, you can just paint and they call it, your brain is an ocean. You know, so you have an oceans of idea inside your brain that coming out through your painting.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:36.000
That's why they said it's very, it's almost, this, I know the word, it takes someone to know, it takes someone to know someone, or it takes someone to know one, or it takes someone to know, it takes one to know someone, or it takes one to know one.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Exactly.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Yeah, those were catching phrases. So people who see on the painting, and they able to, to, to explain or to get into the, the, the, the, the statement of the painting, to capture it as the statement of the painter.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:18.000
It, it gives you, so somebody could understand my thought that you are not alone or you are, you are not, it's not you or they may call it, it's not, that's only you, you know. You somebody there understand your thought.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Somebody there could understand you. That's exactly what I, what I think of it. You know, it's even in photography. Somebody there could appreciate your photography. Somebody there could, could, could, could see the value of your photography.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:59.000
But in painting, no, it's, it's unlimited. It's an ocean of, it's an ocean of thought. It's an, it's a, it's a, unlimited, unlimited ideas that you can put into that and you can get out of your brain and, and write it, do it in reality.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:25.000
That's why I said painting is the extension of your brain, of your inner personality, of your inner thought. That you're putting it to, to, to somebody get the part of your inner thought. Like that's how deep painting for me. Yeah. It's the, the, the, you let them feel or you let them in to your inner thought.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:44.000
It's wonderful. It's wonderful to talk about, about art and also hear how, you know, how important it is to you and how it makes you feel. I'm just wary of the time and your pick up time. But maybe to wrap up, you could tell me what your hopes are for the future.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Oh, my future hope is that, you know, I'm able to, to manifest a good, a good, a greener pasture. I'm able to provide a good future for my children. I know my children are big, but I still have to, so I want them to be, I just, I just like that I will be healthy to, to see them going up until, until the time that, you know, they could have their own family to guide them.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Now, now that's my thought. And then when it's, when it's for my career, I want it to just take it slowly. Whatever is available for me to do, I would do it. And I would start, I wanted to strive higher and higher and higher. And also with my painting, I would continue doing it.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:54.000
I would continue doing it. I would continue, you know, things that I would, things that would make me feel alive, happy and positive and, you know, like, how you say, boost your personality and boost your, boost your, your confidence.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Yeah, that I wanted to see, you know, that, that you can still do it, you know, you can, you still have it, you know, nothing can stop you reaching your goal and making your dream come true.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:27.000
And that's, I really looking for the future that I will be stable with my job. I would be, I would be able to be stable, have a good connection with my children, my two, my two young children. So that's exactly I'm, I'm looking forward for my health as well.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:45.000
That I'll just be healthy, that able to, to be, to be, you know, just for, for everybody, you know, at least I'm healthy for my whole, for my whole family. I'm able to continue helping them, you know, guiding them.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:40:05.000
That's, I really, that's the things that really matter to me is my family, you know, because I think, I think I would be nothing without my family and I would be nothing without, without them, without me being, being present to their life.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:22.000
I think that's the essence of being a mother as well, you know, presence to their children's life. So I want it to be that, that way. And I always said, I wanted to, I wanted to have, to have a clean living so that my children would see that one as well.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:39.000
So that my mom have a good clean living, you know, you don't take vices, you don't smoke, you don't drink. Occasionally you just drink, you know, but you know, they see their mom like, then they have to set the standard in their life.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:41:02.000
I want them to see, I want them to see their mother who's thrive, who's not big, who's the fighter, who, who is, you know, loving, who is caring, who is like wrapped in all in one. And I am, I am there to be, to be, you know, a guiding foundation for them. That's exactly what I like.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Oh, thank you.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Thank you.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Is there anything else that you'd like to share or you feel is important for us to know before we finish?

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:32.000
You know, being here in UK and being allowed to work here is very important that people, people here to know that.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:55.000
British people are very, you know, what to call this one? Embracing. It's not that, it's not, I don't feel they say there is, there is like, they call it different individuality.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:17.000
They have different individuality, but to British people to embrace different, different culture and different, different nationality coming here and they are being accommodative to the people here like me that I'm able to study here, to work here, to live here.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:42.000
You know, it's one thing that I have a big, huge respect with the British people that they are not closing their doors. Even, even, even some of the government is crying, but still they are very lenient and they're very open, open arms, you know, welcoming people who wants to leave here decently to look for a better future.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:43:03.000
And that's one thing I'm very grateful and thankful that I'm able to live here. Even so, circumstances that change, but that one thing that I want, I want people to understand that British people are, are, what to call this one?

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:26.000
British people are blessed to have this country as their own and maybe, maybe they don't see that one, but me as a, coming from a third world country, it's, it's a privilege to, to, to be here and to, to have the same right that you cannot have in the other country.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:48.000
And that's one thing that I am truly blessed and truly thankful, grateful for that opportunity to live in this country, you know, to be able to be, to be able to be a citizen here and to be able to, to become a part of this country is something that I would be grateful for, for all my life.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Me and my daughter being protected in this country, I know that we're protected here. I know that the law here, they serve the law here and they protect the law here. It's one thing that I can sleep peacefully in the night.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:25.000
I thought before I couldn't do that one, because I said, oh, this is other country, they maybe protect their own kin, but no, it's, I'm the, I'm the, I'm the living proof for myself that I could speak to that.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:44.000
British people are blessed to have this country as itself for them. So I'm really honored and glad that I'm able to stay in this country legally, you know, and they got me to stay here with my daughter legally.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Not all, not all are, are, are given the chance, but I, I, I am the one of them that was given the chance and I'm thankful and privileged for that. Yeah.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Well, we're lucky to have you.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
I would say we're lucky to have you.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Okay. That was really wonderful.
