WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
So I'm just going to switch, I'm just going to say that I'm Marsha Armani and I'm here

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.120
with the Theobald Sisters, is that correct in saying that?

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.280
No the Kibbe Sisters because I'm Theobald, I be as James, she married Bryn James.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.280
I go second marriage and James is the second one.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.280
Okay.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.440
They would know us as the Kibbe Sisters wouldn't they?

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:33.800
Oh, we're by all accounts with the, well according to my son and one thing and another and Terry

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.600
and one thing and another, I think we must be the oldest people in the village.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.840
That's what they keep saying.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.000
We can't be far out can we?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.840
So Ivy, so you're 94 Ivy, yeah, and what's your Christian name again?

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.840
Iris.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.200
So Ivy, Iris, how lovely, what's your date of birth?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.440
I'll be 85 now in May.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.120
Oh in May, okay.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.120
85 or 86?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.120
Yeah.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.120
86.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.120
86.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.800
Yeah, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, yeah 86.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.800
And you had, they were five daughters?

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800
Yeah.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.240
So there is, so Ivy and Iris and then we've got Olive.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.240
May.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.240
May.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.640
And Rose.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.640
I'm the middle one myself.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.640
You're the middle one.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.640
I'm the middle one.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.640
You're the middle one.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.640
Yeah.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.360
And the one that was different altogether in any case.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.360
They always said I was the milkman or the baker or the baker or somebody because I always

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.840
had golden blonde curly hair where these all had bouncy hair with a fringe.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.840
Really?

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840
Yeah.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.840
Yeah, with a fringe.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.840
One day.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840
Yeah.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.840
That I was always different.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.840
Yeah.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.240
That I'd always be clean and tidy for a start.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.240
Yeah.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.640
Where somebody else like my other sister May, she would get a frock dirty in a day as the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.840
saying is when mine could be there all the week and still be clean.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.840
She was too fussy.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.840
Too fussy.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840
Always.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.840
And I always kept my tidy.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.840
I always did my hair and always made it.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.840
You're hearing your bloody nails when I was a kid this is now because she's that much

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.840
older than me you know.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.840
She used to sit there in the house with her hands like this.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.840
Her hair wouldn't be a speckled place and her hands would be like that with all her

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.840
painted nails.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.840
So was your mother like that?

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.840
Well, reasonably.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.840
Well, ma'am, yes.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.840
Yes.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.840
I think I follow ma'am a lot for the simple reason.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.840
As I said, although she had five children, she was still, you know, kept herself.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.840
Yes, and young.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.840
Yeah.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.840
She would go to Cardiff and have her perms where they used to hang them up in the air.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.840
That was my first perm.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.840
That was my first perm when I went and I'd mind it was hanging up in the air like this

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.840
on things.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.840
Then she had, then ma'am had water waves.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.840
We were talking about this earlier in the week, weren't we?

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.840
And then water waves.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.840
What's water waves?

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.840
But ma'am was always dressed nice once she had beautiful skin.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840
Did she?

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
Oh, beautiful.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.840
She never had a wrinkle.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.840
Water waves is that they press.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.840
She was 98 when she died.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.840
She never had a wrinkle.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840
You press the waves in.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.840
Beautiful skin.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.840
You know, you press the waves in and put clippers in it.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840
Oh, yeah.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.840
But she always kept herself really, you know, quite good.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.840
Tidy mamma, didn't she?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840
Yeah.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840
Where was she?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840
What was her name?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.840
Fanny.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840
Fanny?

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840
Hi.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.840
Oh, probably an old fashioned name.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840
Oh my goodness.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.840
Where was she from?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.840
Caldecott.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840
She was in Caldecott.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840
Old Caldecott family, yes.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.840
I was the first one born down here.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.840
Really?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.840
The two oldest ones was at Subrook.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.840
Subrook, wasn't it?

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840
Yeah.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.840
Is that because your father was working at Subrook?

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.840
Well, not working, but living.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.840
My dad, my granddad, they lived in Worcester.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.840
But he'd come down to work on the tunnel.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.840
Oh.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.840
See, and then they said that there's a place in Subrook.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840
Okay.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.840
And well, it was, what was it?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.840
There was Grandad Kibbie, Granny Kibbie, but she left after, didn't she?

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.840
She left him.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.840
And then there was Auntie Rosa, Uncle Vic, and then mam and dad, and then mam's, Rose

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.840
and me, all in one little cottage, you know.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.840
Really?

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.840
Well, they did years ago.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.840
They had nowhere to live, didn't they?

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.840
Yes, I can remember.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.840
They all had to live together.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.840
When I went up there, I went up there for my tenth birthday.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.840
I can't remember.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.840
I went up there for my tenth birthday.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.840
I don't know how I would have come to go up there for my tenth birthday on my own.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.840
But I can always remember coming out of them houses and crossing the road to the style

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.840
when the pumping works was going boo.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.840
I was like, yeah.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.840
Boo.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.840
Yeah.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.840
But I can always remember why I went up there on my own.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.840
I'll never know.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.840
You went up to Vic's, I suppose.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.840
I know, but why me?

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.840
Well, she came to Kibbie.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.840
And I know it was my tenth birthday.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.840
I remember it was my tenth birthday.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.840
So there's that row of houses with a track in the middle at Subbrooke.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.840
Is that where you...

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.840
No, Subbrooke, I've got just one row of houses.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.840
Yeah.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.840
I think there's a lot of new houses up there now that we haven't been up there for years.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.840
I think there's a lot of new houses.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.840
But they lived...the old cottages where they lived, where...

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.840
Oh, yeah.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.840
My dad lived as a young boy.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.840
They're all still there, aren't they?

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.840
Oh, they're all still there with everybody.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.840
You've had a bit done to them, you know, one thing or another.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.840
Was the pumping station noisy then?

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.840
Oh, yes.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.840
Yes.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.840
Bump, bump, bump, bump.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.840
Yes.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.840
But of course, it's like any other noise.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.840
It's like when you hear the...

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.840
Not about the trains going along here.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.840
When you first come here, you hear the trains.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.840
After a while, you don't hear them.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.840
No.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.840
You don't hear them.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.840
So when did you move to Rocket then?

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.840
Sorry, the house in Subbrooke.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.840
Where did everyone sleep?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.840
Pardon?

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.840
Where did everyone sleep in Subbrooke?

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.840
Don't know.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.840
I don't know.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.840
No.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.840
But that's how they lived years ago.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.840
You got married and then you lived with your mother and father, didn't you?

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.840
Yeah.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.840
Well, Mam got married to Dad and they had nowhere to live,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.840
so they had to live with their father, which was my grandchild,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.840
because Vic was already there and then he married Rosa

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.840
and they were all there together.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.840
But Rose and Vic had two children after,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.840
but Mam had already moved to Rocket then before they had them.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.840
Mam was married before Vic and Rosa.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.840
So where did your parents marry, do you know?

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.840
In Portscrew.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.840
Portscrew.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.840
Portscrew it.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.840
And you know it snowed?

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.840
April 3rd.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.840
4th of April.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.840
Yeah.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.840
Easter Monday.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.840
Yeah.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.840
4th of April and it snowed.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.840
It snowed.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.840
Nobody could go up there because we had that much snow by all account.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.840
Yeah.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.840
Not as we know.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840
My dad told me since.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.840
Yeah, I know what Mamma said.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.840
Yeah.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.840
That I know there was one old photograph somewhere,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.840
but don't ask me where,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.840
was with a bike outside the church where, you know,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.840
one of Mam's friends was.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.840
She must have got there on her bike or something

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.840
and went into Portscrew at church.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.840
But that was quite unusual.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.840
And they thought it had snow, quite a bit of snow in there.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.840
But I don't remember it.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.840
They didn't know if they could get to the church.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.840
Mam didn't know if she was going to be able to get that to Portscrew

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.840
it to the church because of the snow.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840
Yeah.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.840
Nice little place at Portscrew at church.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.840
I've never been to Portscrew at church actually.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.840
Oh, nice.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.840
Nice little.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.840
Church, isn't it?

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.840
Yeah.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.840
So when.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.840
I haven't been inside mine.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.840
You won't get a word in it.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.840
It's okay.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.840
When did your, where was your father from then?

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.840
Was he from Worcester?

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.840
Worcester.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.840
So and your mother's family were from.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840
Caldecott.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.840
From Caldecott.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840
From Caldecott.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.840
She was a Caldecott girl.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.840
Yeah.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.840
So why did they move to Roggett?

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.840
Why did your parents move to Roggett?

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.840
Oh, well it was all to do with the railway, wasn't it?

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.840
Well, yeah, because they were all living in that house in Portscrew

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.840
together a lot, see.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.840
So when they put the railway houses up here, well then Mam and Dad was offered one.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.840
Because he worked on the railway?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840
Oh, yes.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840
Dad worked all his life.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.840
All his life on the railway.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.840
He was an engine driver.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.840
Yeah.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.840
He was a driver.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.840
Used to drive the old steam trains.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840
He was a steam engine driver.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840
Oh, yes.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840
Oh, yes.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.840
Right from a boy.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.840
From about one fourteen, wasn't it?

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.840
Yeah.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840
He was always on the railway.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.840
Yeah.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.840
We was only talking about this.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.840
When we, no, last week, weren't we?

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.840
Yeah.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.840
Obviously you or Steve I was talking to about it.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.840
No, it must have been you, wasn't it?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.840
We were, because we didn't know what this lady was going to ask us.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:44.840
About the different times, as I said, when Dad used to go double home.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.840
Double home.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.840
And when they went double home they just went and had a stay a night somewhere.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.840
And then come back.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:10:00.840
And another little thing they done was if they were at home and they wanted emergency

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.840
driver or one thing or another they sent what they called a call boy out.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.840
Like Terry?

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.840
No.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840
No.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:15.840
A call boy just purposely to come and knock at Mum's door to tell her Dad to go out to

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.840
work as they needed him.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840
That was a call boy?

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840
Yeah, call boy.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.840
What they called a call boy.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.840
A call boy.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.840
They knock on the door.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.840
Yeah.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.840
And that could be any time of day or night.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.840
Oh, any time of night.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840
Any time of night.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840
Yeah.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.840
But, um.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.840
What was your Dad's name?

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.840
George.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.840
George?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.840
George could be.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.840
So he joined the railway straight from school?

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.840
School, yeah.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.840
Rightly retired before the, what do they call it now?

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.840
Diesel.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.840
The diesel, that's right.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.840
He didn't bother when they turned over the diesel.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.840
What was that firm that took over the railways?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.840
Beecham's?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840
Was it Beecham's?

00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.840
Oh, Beecham's.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.840
Dr. Beecham.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.840
Ah, that's right.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.840
He closed all the railways up.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.840
No, he come up to old age pension time and that.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.840
So he went to school in Sudbrook, did he?

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.840
No, we all, all in Brogget.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.840
Where did your Dad go to school?

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.840
Oh, Sudbrook.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.840
No, Sudbrook I explained, did he?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.840
So do you know how he got into the railway?

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.840
Do you know how that happened?

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.840
Well, no, I suppose that's work.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.840
There was, it was only, that seemed to be the only work around here.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.840
There weren't many houses, look.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.840
No.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.840
And I'm going to say, where we're sitting now, this was a field.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.840
That's when we first moved to Brogget, yeah.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:48.840
And we used to have, that's why I've got so many brambles coming up in my garden,

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:57.840
that old gutsy Gleed had a white horse, there's somebody's cat out there,

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.840
had a white horse and he used to keep them in this field.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.840
Old gutsy Gleed, that's what we used to call him, didn't we?

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.840
Because he used to go around with vegetables and one thing and another and all.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.840
And I'll say on there he's gutsy Gleed.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840
What, selling them?

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.840
Ah, selling them.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.840
And this was all fields all the way down to the seawall?

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.840
Oh, good, this was all fields, all fields everywhere.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.840
There weren't many houses here when we came here.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.840
Where I'm living now on the main roads, when I was a kid, that was tennis courts, wasn't it?

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.840
I was going to say.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.840
There was nothing there at all.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.840
Really?

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.840
When we'd go up into Mam's bedroom, which had a bay window,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.840
there was all fields in at the back of there and there was a tennis court,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.840
we used to watch them playing tennis.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.840
And then the other fields and all.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.840
So it really felt like you were in the countryside here.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.840
Well, we was in the country, we couldn't be anymore in the country, from what we was.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.840
Could we?

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.840
No, we used to watch them playing tennis.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.840
I remember they used to go up to play tennis as well then, didn't they?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.840
Do you remember moving here then?

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.840
Me? No, I was born here.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.840
We were born here, yes.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.840
This was me and Ivy that was born in Suffolk.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.840
Yes, no, I was born here.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.840
I was born, well, not here, on the main road.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.840
At home? Were you born at home, both of you?

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.840
Yes.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, no one recalling in those days, was there?

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.840
No maternity hospital said.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.840
No, that's another thing we were talking about.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.840
We were always going down memory lane because we were at the age when we'd go down memory lane.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.840
You know what I mean?

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:46.840
And we were saying, when we were going to school,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:57.840
that we played Wippentop and Marbles and hooplats all down the main road where you would see the cars going and going and going and going.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.840
Now, we used to go down there, we used to play Marbles going to school.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.840
We'd never see a car, would we?

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.840
No cars?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840
No, no cars.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.840
And the market then used to be there and then you'd have a load of cows come up.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.840
Oh, the market near the Rocket Hotel?

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.840
The market was right by the side of the school.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.840
Yeah, the market was...

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840
By the Rocket?

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.840
With the little bungalows.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.840
You know, the turning down to the church.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.840
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.840
Where them bungalows are, that was the market.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.840
That was the market.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.840
And you remember that?

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:34.840
Oh, I remember going over the market, going head over heels over the baths.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.840
Yes, and the kids.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840
Yeah.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.840
You could see it all, but there was a school, there was a little class, a little road.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:47.840
And then we'd go up on the baths and have a look at the cows being weighed and you name it.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.840
Did you?

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:54.840
And then they used to, the ones that were left that were sold, the cows and one thing or another,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.840
they were left down... where did Lisa live?

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.840
Station Road?

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.840
Yeah.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.840
There was like pens there.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840
Yeah.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.840
And they used to leave the cows in there and they used to be picked up by the train.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.840
Really?

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.840
Yeah.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.840
Who was looking after them?

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.840
Well, everybody fend for theirself, didn't they?

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.840
I suppose somebody must have fed them, but they waited until a proper train came to pick

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.840
them up and off they went.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.840
The cows used to come up there then, didn't they, go on the train to go through the tunnel?

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.840
The cows?

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.840
The cows, yes, go through the tunnel.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.840
The cars?

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.840
Cars, yes, go through the tunnel.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.840
They used to put them all on the tracks and then they used to take them through the tunnel.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.840
What, you mean for people driving cars?

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.840
Yeah.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.840
Yeah.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.840
Not cars to be sold.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.840
No, no, people going on holidays and all that.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.840
Really?

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.840
Because otherwise they had to go all up clusters and round seats.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.840
At the station.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.840
They had to go through the tunnel.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.840
That's right, at the station.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.840
Yeah.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:05.840
You could stand there and watch them chaining your car onto the thing and then you'd get

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.840
on the train and your car would come...

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.840
Coming behind you on the tracks?

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.840
Were they just open trailers then?

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.840
The cars were?

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.840
Yeah.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.840
The cars were on open trailers.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.840
Yeah, like open, you know, just put them on and chained them on the lot of the things.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.840
Really?

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.840
So did the drivers sit in the car or did they go...

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.840
No, they went in the car in the train.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.840
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.840
As far as I remember, they went in the train.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.840
Yeah, I remember the cars going.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.840
So as children, you would go down and watch that walk across the fields?

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.840
Oh, yeah.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.840
Yeah.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.840
Crikey, yeah.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.840
Yeah.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:54.840
But another thing, we used to always have a turntable here to turn the engines around.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.840
Yeah.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.840
Which they have only got in...

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.840
I don't know, what have they ever got?

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.840
Anymore now, have they, wonder?

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.840
Right.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.840
Have they got any anywhere now?

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.840
Nothing down there now, nothing.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.840
No, I know not down there, but any part of the country, I mean.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.840
I don't know.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.840
Probably at one of these steam engine enthusiastic places.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.840
They must have something to turn something.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840
Yeah.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.840
But there, we'd have the steam engines turning around.

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:23.840
Go up on?

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.840
Go up on.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.840
They'd go along where I'd lived over in Woodland View.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:41.840
There was a railway line from down the bottom of there, right along, under an archway, and

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.840
get down to the moors then, wouldn't they?

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.840
Down to the moors.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.840
And that line used to go up to Ifton Quarry.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.840
Yeah.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:18:01.840
Ifton Quarry was in full swing then, you know, and Big Pool there, one there, and people,

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.840
you know, used to wave their lorries, go in there and wave their lorries.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.840
I was only thinking the other day, the girl, Earl, used to work in the office there, didn't

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.840
she?

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.840
Yeah.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.840
What was her surname?

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.840
Hey, you know we were trying to think of somebody's name the other day?

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.840
Yeah, Tyler.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.840
No.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.840
Oh, when's one of them?

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.840
No, well, no, it's gone again, tell them, getting bloody old candy away.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.840
I've really forgotten them.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:41.840
Do you know when you're, so they built houses especially for the rail men here today?

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.840
Yeah, railway houses.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.840
Is that because the Seven Junction was becoming, you know, a busy place?

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.840
It was the main, yeah, there was all the big yards there.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.840
Yeah.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.840
But Terry worked there when he left school, he was a runner doing all the, just to worry

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.840
about him, because he'd have to, as the trains come, trucks come running down, Terry had

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:07.840
to unhook them with a pole, you know, and I was always worrying in case he slipped and

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.840
went under because the trucks were moving.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840
He said it was a dangerous job.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.840
You know, yes.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.840
And he said there was one man here who'd lost both his legs, somebody he used to work

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.840
with.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.840
Oh, yes, yeah.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.840
Yeah.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.840
So it was quite a dangerous place.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.840
Yeah, it was a very dangerous place.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.840
Did you?

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.840
And it was massive, wasn't it?

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.840
And that was all we got.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.840
Now, at one time we had a restaurant and all along that station, didn't we?

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.840
Oh, yes, the train.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.840
As I said, I'd been looking for the piece of paper, because I knew I had a piece of

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:47.840
paper, the full size of the Argus, gone brown naturally through age, and there's the rocket

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.840
station, all walking up where you could walk up, go along and then come down.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.840
Really?

00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:00.840
And then there was another booking office where in the winter you had a nice fire in

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.840
there that you could go and sit in there and open fire.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.840
A waiting room?

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.840
Oh, yes, a coal fire, yeah.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.840
And well, we...

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.840
There was a waiting room?

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.840
Oh, that's right, and then there was the...

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.840
That's right, over the other side there was this little tea place.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.840
What was their names, them two ginger ladies?

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.840
There was another singer, we seem to have forgotten what their names are.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.840
They lived by the Bake House, didn't they?

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.840
Yeah.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.840
What the hell was their names?

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.840
I can't remember, no.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.840
The proper...

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.840
Two sisters, all maids, they was something.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.840
Two old maids sisters.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:38.840
Used to run the restaurant.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.840
And they used to know you could get the odd bun and a cup of tea and one thing and another.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.840
Nowhere to go and sit inside.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.840
Oh, wasn't there?

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.840
Just a, you know, just an ordinary little shed place.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.840
So was it quite an old fashioned station then, Rugget?

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.840
Yeah.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.840
It was a busy station, because of the cars going over and all that, you know.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.840
The cattle coming in.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.840
It was a very busy station.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.840
Yes, when you had the Queen stop in your wands.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.840
Now I've heard stories about the Queen stop in your wands.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.840
Oh, she stopped in the sidings at Butchkiewicz.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.840
That was when she stopped in the sidings.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:23.840
But do you remember when they, Maddie, dolled all the toilets up in the station thinking

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.840
just in case she got a cut shot.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.840
But then just in case, you know, they, you know, they just sweep the floors when everybody's

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.840
coming.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.840
Well, they'd done all the same to the toilet and all, just in case.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:42.840
Just in case her ladyship wanted, as if she would mind, as if she wouldn't have one on

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.840
her, on the train, on the Royal Train, you know.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.840
She used to sleep overnight, didn't she, on the sidings.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.840
Oh, really?

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.840
Yeah.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.840
Butchkiewicz, it was well known, wasn't it?

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.840
Well known that was, a stopping place.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.840
Really?

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.840
Well, to us local people, not to strangers.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.840
No.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.840
Because it was down the siding.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.840
Yeah.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.840
And they always, when they were coming from London or anywhere and going down the car,

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:11.840
they'd from front to down, they'd back in there in Portskiewicz for the night.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:22.840
And then, and that's when we were kids, going over to the bridge down over here, because

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:28.840
the train wouldn't be picking up much speed and they would be coming under the bridge,

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.840
the Royal Train, you know.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.840
Really?

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840
Yeah.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.840
Because kids used to be down there, you know, like kids are.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.840
Did you ever see anyone?

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.840
Not really.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.840
On the train?

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.840
I don't remember seeing anybody.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.840
Because by the time they were there, they were inside, I expect they might be having

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.840
their breakfast or anything.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.840
But nobody would go up to the sidings and knock on the door and things like that.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.840
But of course, there wasn't all this terrorists and nothing like that.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.840
Everything, the railway men knew that was there.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.840
We knew they were there, if you know what I mean.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.840
Of course, they had their guards around, they naturally were there.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.840
But it wasn't, well, no, it wasn't all on bloody telly.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.840
They're staying at Portskiewicz for the weekend.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.840
There was no telly then.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.840
No, that's what I said, there was nothing.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.840
We didn't have no telly when we were kids.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:29.840
They just backed up there quietly and backed down and went on to wherever they were going.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.840
So you remember that as children that they used to?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.840
Yes.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.840
Oh, God, oh.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.840
Yeah, I remember him backing up into Portskiewicz, the Queen.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.840
Of course, I mean, it was steam then and trains were slow.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.840
So they had to stop you overnight from London because it took them all day to get down here.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.840
Yeah.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.840
So your father was a steam engine driver.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.840
So did he ever talk much about his work?

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.840
Was he away a lot or would he be away a lot?

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.840
Well, he never talked, I think it's because he had five girls, if you know what.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.840
If he had boys, he might have been a little different.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.840
But he had just had girls and that.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.840
There's another thing I remember, can you remember that?

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.840
When you worked on the railway, you had cheap coal a lot.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.840
Okay.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.840
You had fires and all that.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.840
But you had to put your name down when you wanted a ton of coal.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.840
Yeah.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:39.840
And it doesn't matter, he could be away on Double Home, he could be anywhere.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.840
And this ton of coal would come and be dumped out on the road.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.840
I'd like to see it dumped out today.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.840
I'd go down with the god.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.840
Dumped on the road.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.840
So that means to say...

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.840
Oh gosh.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.840
You had to shovel it on the coal looms.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:02.840
And us kids used to have to get this coal and put it in the coal looms in buckets and one thing and another off the road.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.840
Really?

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.840
Yeah.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.840
Other than that, well, we had to.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.840
Yeah.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.840
We couldn't stay on the road.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.840
So where was the cottage? Where was it?

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.840
Was it by the station?

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.840
Well, nowhere else.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.840
Yeah.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.840
Where we lived.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.840
Oh no, just on the corner of the road.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.840
On the main road.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.840
Was it opposite the Roggett there?

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.840
There's some railway cottages along there, isn't there?

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.840
Oh no, we didn't do...

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.840
No, no, no. Just up here, no.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:34.840
The cottage you were thinking of, what Terry told you, is that's where I lived.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.840
Of course.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.840
Okay, I'm getting confused now.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.840
When we lived as kids, it was on the main road.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.840
Ah, yeah.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.840
South Grover's coal then, wasn't it?

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.840
Yeah.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.840
When we were married, first married, and Terry was a baby, that's where we lived in the little cottage.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:56.840
So would many of your friends, when you were young, would many of them have been children of railway workers?

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.840
Well, I've spent a lot of them, Lord.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.840
A lot of them, Lord.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.840
Yeah, a lot of them, because...

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.840
But they're only thinking of Edna.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.840
Other than the railway houses, there was only Ifton Road, wasn't there?

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.840
Yes, there were a lot of many.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.840
And that was called Ifton then, not Roggett. That was Ifton on its own.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.840
That main road going up there to the club.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:14.840
Yeah.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.840
And then all it was, it was railway houses, yeah.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.840
Really?

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.840
Until they built after you and your council and...

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.840
Oh, very few houses. All this.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:28.840
I can... Dad used to, when we lived up on the main road there, we had a fairy cycle.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.840
I don't suppose the kids have ever seen one, have they?

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.840
No, what's that?

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.840
A fairy cycle?

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.840
No.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.840
Well, it's like a miniature bike, wasn't it?

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.840
About that high, wasn't it?

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.840
And Dad used to put us on to learn to ride.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.840
We'd sit on it, and then he'd give us a push, because there was no traffic about nothing.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:59.840
And we'd go like hell down that road, and then up over the bloody pavement down there into the field,

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.840
and let me fall ass off her head, but we...

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.840
But that's the way you learn to drive, to bloody ride your bike.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.840
You never see a fairy cycle now, do you?

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.840
No.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:18.840
It's like a miniature... you know, you get a fattened, you know, the fath-in bike and all that.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.840
Yeah, I just do like that one minute.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.840
This was a miniature bike.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.840
Well, I think, with a big front wheel, and then goes down to a little one at the back.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.840
That's a penny fath-in, that is.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.840
That's a penny fath-in bike.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:35.840
No, no, this was just an ordinary, like, two wheels on the bike, and he used to put us on to learn to ride.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.840
And he used to put us on there.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.840
I can remember having a little three-wheeler.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.840
I can remember having my little three-wheeler.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.840
Yeah.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.840
I had to.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.840
Yes, because as I said, I was eight years, and eight years is quite a lot.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.840
There's a big difference, isn't there?

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.840
Yeah, it is.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.840
You know, not many kids.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.840
Yeah.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.840
Yeah.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.840
So what was it like growing up here then?

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.840
It was rural, there wasn't much traffic.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.840
So you describe it as the moors.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.840
Some people call it the levels, don't they?

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.840
Yes.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.840
But what was special about this place as children?

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.840
What was it like to grow up here?

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.840
Oh, ten times better than what it is today, I can tell you that for a start.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.840
Yes.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.840
Oh my God.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:24.840
We used to spend most of our time, when we were young, we'd be down the moors, messing around.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.840
In the water, and a couple of jam sandwich, and then the holidays, we'd be down there all day.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.840
Yeah.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:36.840
At the woods, then we'd be open, because we had access to all the woods, and one thing or another.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:44.840
We'd go up there with a gang, perhaps three or four, five, six, seven, it was all according to who you were friends with at the time.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:52.840
And make house in the woods, and as you said, take a bit of bread and jam up with our own, Bob's your uncle.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.840
You'd be out all day.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.840
You made your own fun.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.840
Yeah, we'd go up there all day.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.840
Following the owens, that's right up there with the fox and owens when they were going.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.840
Following the hounds?

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.840
Hounds, the fox and owens, and making on the red coats and all that, yeah.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.840
Oh, I used to see them from my bedroom window on the thing, I could.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840
Really?

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.840
Yes, we made our own.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.840
The gypsies used to come, didn't they?

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.840
Eh?

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.840
The gypsies used to come up the minute.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.840
Oh, the gypsies, aye, the gypsies.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.840
Did they?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.840
With their brown and white horses and their big old fashioned caravans.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.840
Caravans, yeah, they used to be up the minute lane, didn't they?

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.840
Up the minute lane, yeah.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.840
And what were they doing up there?

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.840
Well, making pegs and then they'd come round the village.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.840
Round the village, really?

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.840
Yeah, and bits of lace and little posies, didn't they?

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.840
Yeah.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.840
Come round the door selling them.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.840
Or cut the flowers out of the woods and one thing and another.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.840
And they were harmless enough.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.840
Yeah.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.840
And they were lovely, one day you could go up there and they'd talk to you and yeah,

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.840
nothing like today.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:00.840
Oh, we used to find, which you can't do today, you know, because, but we used, well we always

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.840
have plenty to do, we never.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.840
As soon as we come in from school.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.840
I mean, today, they've got to spend money, haven't they, today?

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.840
They've got to be spending money.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.840
They don't do anything else other than spending money or flickering their fingers, do they?

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840
Yeah.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:19.840
As soon as we come in from school, we'd go straight out, wouldn't we, and play marbles

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840
and we'd be talking.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.840
I was going to say, but you know, just playing.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:29.840
You might not believe it, but we only, where Iris was saying, where she was in that little

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.840
house on the side by the school, the school wasn't all that big.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:41.840
But all of us was taught there from infants until we left at 14.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.840
Yeah.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.840
And now going up there to.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.840
Only four classrooms.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.840
Right, and they'd all be in the same, you know.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.840
You'd all know each other very well, wouldn't you?

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.840
Yes, we were all in the college.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:31:00.840
The boys used to have carpentry, not carpentry, out in the garden.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:06.840
They used to, a bit of, what do they call that then, the gardening, I'd say.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.840
And we used to do sewing or knitting or something, wasn't it?

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.840
But everything was all combined, if you know what I mean.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.840
Yeah.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.840
But opposite the school.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:24.840
We didn't have no separate teacher for, the one teacher taught us all day, whatever it was.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:32.840
Yes, there's a photo in that, in that cardigan book I got in there.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.840
Did you ever see the cardigan book?

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.840
No, no.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.840
I got several books with all this in them.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:46.840
I'll show you, I got a photo of my school's thing.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.840
Really?

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.840
And I'm in the cardigan book and.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.840
When the evacuees came.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.840
Yes.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.840
There were so many who couldn't, couldn't got to school.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.840
Yeah.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:03.840
So we used, one week we went in the morning and the evacuees went in the afternoon, and

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.840
then the following week, and vice versa.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.840
Really?

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.840
Yeah.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.840
Where did these evacuees come from, do you know?

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.840
All from London and all that, yeah.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.840
We had loads of evacuees here.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.840
And where were they staying?

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.840
Where were they staying?

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.840
Where were they living?

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.840
All in people's houses.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.840
Yeah.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.840
But we couldn't have them because we had too many, you know, three bedrooms and it was

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.840
five of us, you know.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.840
So what was it like as a child receiving all these people into your community?

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.840
What was that like?

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.840
Yeah, they were all right.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.840
We got on all right with them.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.840
Yeah.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.840
Did you play with them?

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.840
Yeah.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.840
Yeah.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.840
Yeah.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.840
So did you ever play on the reams or anything like that?

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.840
On the reams, on the waterways?

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.840
Were they part of your playground and?

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.840
What, down the moors?

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.840
Yeah.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.840
You mean, oh yeah, we spent half our life down the moors.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.840
What did you do down there?

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.840
I don't know, we just used to sit around talking and...

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.840
Well, looking for...

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.840
I don't know, we'd stay down the moor all day.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:06.840
We were looking for crabs and you name it, we were looking for it.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.840
Yes.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.840
Well, that was along the waterways.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.840
Did you ever go fishing or swimming there?

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.840
No, it was a bit too mucky for that.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.840
Yeah.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.840
Muck, one net.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.840
Yeah.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.840
But...

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:28.840
All about, you know, on, beyond the sea wall, the estuary, did you ever go swimming there

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.840
or walking out after the tide?

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.840
None of us could swim.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.840
No.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.840
No.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.840
We used to go out, well, we never, but my grandchild...

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.840
Yeah.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.840
Used to go out the bedwinds fishing.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.840
Oh really?

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.840
Oh, I mean, you used to go out getting cockles.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:49.840
You had to be very careful because it was like a patch of sand right out in the water.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.840
Yeah.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.840
But when the tide came in, it came in quickly and it came round this way at the same time.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.840
Oh.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.840
And you'd get trapped on the bedwinds.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.840
Yeah.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.840
You had to know the tide.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840
Yeah.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.840
And I walked back before it came.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.840
And he knew the tide?

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.840
He used to go out there fishing.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.840
I used to help him make his nets.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.840
Really?

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:08.840
Yeah.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.840
Yeah, you'd stab them up on the...

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.840
This is where you are now.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.840
Yes, yeah.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.840
I was on the...

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.840
Oh my goodness.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.840
On 9th Street there.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.840
Crossways, I think it's a crossway.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.840
That was a new road years ago.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:19.840
This was a new road years ago.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.840
Where did you help make the nets then?

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.840
Where did you do that?

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.840
My granda and granda used to do that.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:23.840
Oh, yeah.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.840
Is it?

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.840
Yeah.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.840
I can't see very well.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.840
Let's have a look.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.840
But there's our class and there's me.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.840
Oh.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.840
I got none there.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.840
Look because they...

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.840
And that's old boss Baker, you're who was there.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.840
Yeah.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.840
That I know.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.840
That's his daughter.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.840
They've got all their names here.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.840
That's his mother.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.840
That is her.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.840
Yeah.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.840
And that's me.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.840
That's my grandma.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.840
That's me.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.840
And that's my granda.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.840
That's my grandma.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.840
That's my grandma.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.840
And that's my granda.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840
And that's the two.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.840
That's her grandma.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.840
And that's my grandma.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.840
And that's my grandma.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.240
They've got all their names here.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.240
How lovely.

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.840
But all these, I remember all of them.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.840
Oh, and this was at Rocket School.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.840
1937, my goodness.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.840
I wonder how many of these are still around.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.840
How many stayed in the area?

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.840
Oh, more or less died, you mean.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.840
You know, a lot of them are dead, isn't it?

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.840
A lot of them that I went to school with, gone.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840
Yeah.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.840
Yeah, so the...

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:28.840
No, I had that piece of argus and do you think I could find it?

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.840
Not again, I think.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.840
What did you use to make the nets?

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:40.840
Well, you stuck it on a little oaky, because it was a big old fashioned thing you had to cook in the oven.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.840
You know, with no gas stove then.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.840
You cook your oven big black.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.840
You put the stove lid on there.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.840
And then it was...

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.840
How can I describe it?

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.840
It was like a wooden thing like that.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.840
Yeah.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.840
And they had a piece coming up the middle with all this stuff twirled around.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840
Yeah.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:08.840
And then we had to hook it in, hook it in like that, pull it out, hook it back and make the net.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:12.840
So did you have... was it like a big wooden needle you had to do that?

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.840
Yeah, it was like a...

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.840
Series of knots?

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.840
It was wood, I know it was wood.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.840
And it was sort of like that with the thing up the middle.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.840
Oh.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.840
Yeah, I used to set it up in Granshaw and make his nets.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840
Did you?

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840
There's a...

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.840
That's lovely.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.840
...pure of the pictures in there of Roggett, the little bit that they put in there for Roggett.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:38.840
I can't see that very well.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.840
Terry took me up to the church and this is the mission hall.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.840
Is the mission hall still there?

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.840
Because I mean this is just so different, even now, looking at Sodbrooke Bear, I mean it's so developed, hasn't it?

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.840
Yes.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.840
Over the last 50, 60 years.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.840
I haven't been up to Sodbrooke for ages.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.840
Goodness me.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.840
Oh, there's the Roggett Hotel there.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.840
Yes, that was a good old thing.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.840
They used to have dances and all in there in the Roggett Hotel.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.840
Did you?

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.840
Back in our school...

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.840
Mum and Dad used to go dancing in the Roggett, didn't they?

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.840
I was only seeing a girl on the thing that...

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.840
Oh yes, they used to have dances and all sorts of things.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.840
Yeah.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.840
And another thing I remember up going up to the station with what they called the tinat.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.840
Yeah.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.840
Steve remembers that.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.840
Your red tinat.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:40.840
And your red tinat, which the footballers used to change in there.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:48.840
And I can always remember that for how many railway houses and railwaymen and all that come there,

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.840
we used to have our Christmas party there.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:38:00.840
And I can always remember there was five of us girls and we all had presents like they usually did.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.840
And Olive had a famyad.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:14.840
Well, I can't remember what I had, but I know Olive, when she opened hers, she had a famyad.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.840
And we were all...

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.840
Just out of gives you know what I mean.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.840
So did you...

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.840
Did you...

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.840
Terry was saying that he used to go hunting for eggs.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:37.840
Your father used to tell Terry to go out and get eggs on the moors to make omelettes with or something like that.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.840
Did you ever go getting eggs or...?

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.840
No, I don't remember that.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.840
No?

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.840
No.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.840
So did the boys and girls play together or did you all play separately?

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.840
Yes.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.840
Well, I don't think...

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.840
The boys used to get outside Miss White's, didn't they?

00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.840
The shop.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:07.840
Well, the one boy, the boy Watkins, took Olive up the woods, he went with a gang of them, eh?

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.840
And he cut all Olive's hair off.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.840
She came home with no hair.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.840
Cut her hair all off.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.840
Can you remember that?

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.840
No, I remember it being said, but I don't remember it.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.840
Yeah, that was just that much older.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.840
Your mother must have been furious.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:30.840
When I was little, you know, when I was small, of course Rosie had left school and was working, because Rosie was 11 years older than me.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.840
Of course, yeah.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.840
You know.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:33.840
Yeah, you're just the baby.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.840
Yeah, I remember Tratty Watkins, we used to call him, didn't we?

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.840
He lived on top of the hill.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.840
As I said, when I think of it...

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.840
She had no hair.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.840
The war made hell of a difference in our family.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.840
The war?

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.840
I know we had no boys.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.840
Yeah.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:40:01.840
Oh, it made hell of a difference, because I was too old, Rose and May, which could have been about 17 at the time, they were sent up to Coventry to work in the factories.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.840
Were they really?

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.840
Ammunition factories, yeah.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:15.840
Ammunition factories, but I couldn't go because I was 14 in the August, as I think it's the war started or something in September.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.840
Oh, yeah.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.840
September the 3rd or something, but I couldn't go.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:27.840
But after that, I had to go all sorts of jobs.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.840
It was no picking and shoving and buying and getting money for nothing and more, a lot of days.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:41.840
You had to, what job the labour exchange gave you, you had to go and do it.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.840
Do it.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.840
So what did you have to do?

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.840
Well, I had two or three jobs.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:58.840
I had, one of them I know, I went to Newport and on the bus and sorting nails out.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.840
No, no, what do you think that, sorting nails.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.840
Wow.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:11.840
We were sat on benches and having piles of nails and we'd go like this and pick up the good ones and the bad ones.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.840
There's no robots then, there's no way with the robots.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840
Yeah.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.840
Picking it all out.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:25.840
Then we went, then I went to Portscrew and pulling nails out of wood.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.840
That's right, I may have done that, didn't she?

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:35.840
We had a lot of old wood would come in so they could reuse it.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.840
Yeah.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.840
So we worked on that.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.840
Then we went down the...

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.840
Didn't you work at the Boxworks?

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.840
Eh?

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.840
Didn't you work at the Boxworks?

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.840
In Portscrew it.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.840
Boxworks?

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.840
No, not the Boxworks.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:56.840
Then the tinworks, I went down in the printing works.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.840
Oh, I worked there.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:08.840
And we'd done sorts of printing things there and that's when they changed over then to they were making plastic

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:14.840
instead of doing sheets of things for making tins for everything.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:20.840
And I remember pinning salts because they always had to go through the machine two or three times

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.840
because there were two or three times lots of printing.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.840
I worked in the tinworks.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:33.840
Then there was these black things they were, they used to put them over the car head vents.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.840
Oh, yes.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.840
Black.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.840
Yeah.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.840
They'd have them down in the black and then they'd be hung up when they'd go through the ovens.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.840
But they would be to take the glare if you were driving a car.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.840
You wouldn't...

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.840
And was that in Newport?

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.840
No, we were in Lugley.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.840
Caldecott.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.840
Caldecott.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.840
Yeah.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840
In Caldecott.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.840
That's fascinating.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.840
Down the pill.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.840
Yeah.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.840
Little black things there.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.840
Yeah.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.840
And used to put on the headlights they used to to stop the glare.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.840
Yeah, so they couldn't see from above.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:13.840
And another thing we used to watch a lot from our house and then we would watch the incendiary bombs

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.840
going over Dinham.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.840
Yeah.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.840
During the war.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.840
Where's Dinham?

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.840
Just up by here in Corwent.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.840
Corwent.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:23.840
Where you saw the bombs.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.840
The training, Corwent training area that is now.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.840
Yeah.

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.840
We used to call it Dinham then.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.840
Oh, really?

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.840
My son worked there for 20 years, my other son.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.840
Oh, really?

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:33.840
Why is it Corwent?

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.840
I used to, I could see from my bedroom window you could see all the lights.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.840
Yeah, you could see them all from the window.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.840
Well, they were, the lights were looking for planes.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:48.840
Look, the planes, that's right, the planes would, they would, well, as you said.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.840
Drop the incendiary bombs, didn't they?

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.840
And then the fires would start.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.840
Why were they dropping bombs there?

00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:00.840
Because they used to stock all the little bombs and all that.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.840
Shells.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.840
Everything else.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.840
Really?

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.840
It was a depot.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:09.840
It was like a depot, like they got no, like Tesco's got a depot like there.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.840
Well, that was a depot because it was underground as well.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:18.840
That, for all the animation and different things.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.840
So you used to watch that from your window?

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.840
My bedroom window, you could see all that.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.840
No, when we was kids from the house.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.840
Really?

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.840
From the bedroom window, yeah.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.840
Used to watch it.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.840
Used to see all that.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:30.840
Yeah.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.840
Oh, was it, I mean, were you scared?

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.840
I mean, what did you think?

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.840
Well, we never took no, no, I can always remember getting under the table.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.840
Our mum used to put us under the table.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.840
I was seven when the war started.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.840
Wow.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.840
Yeah.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.840
Didn't she?

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.840
Mum used to put us under the, in the pantry, wasn't it?

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:51.840
When the siren went, we used to have to go in the pantry, yeah, and mum put a thing on the floor, didn't she?

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.840
It was all like in the pantry.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.840
Yes, because there was a big concrete slab there.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.840
They never had fridges in them days.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.840
No.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.840
There was a slab on the concrete slab.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.840
The concrete slab, yeah.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.840
Did you have an air raid shelter in the garden?

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.840
No.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.840
No, we never had a road.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.840
No, we never.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:20.840
Do you know, and I remember us when we were, we just started work, as I said at the beginning of the war, it's got a lot to say for the beginning of the war.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:30.840
That we were home and the planes come over and a bomb dropped at Roggett Poole, didn't it?

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.840
Yeah.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:37.840
And dad was in bed at the time, he must have been working nights, and you couldn't see Roggett Poole.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.840
This is the, you're Roggett Poole down here, you can't see it because it was, you know.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:48.840
And we went up and said, dad, get up, dad, get up, there's dropping bombs.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.840
And he never got up, did he?

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.840
And it was just for one bomb?

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.840
One, no, no.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.840
We've got one of the minutes.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.840
We had one boy killed over where you've just seen a pub, didn't you?

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.840
Yeah, I was at the pub, yeah, boy pretty.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:13.840
He lived in the house on a couple of little bungalows that was on there, and he come out to the gate to watch what was going on, kid-like, and he got killed.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.840
He was, it was shrapnel, wasn't he?

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.840
And, yeah.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.840
Did you know him?

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.840
Yeah.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:26.840
It was lucky that they hadn't turned out of the pub at the time, so they were in the pub, you know.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:31.840
And another one, that one.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.840
One dropped at the top of the minute.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:40.840
The minute's late, and that was dad won it, but a crater, a huge big one.

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.840
He used to go up there and see the crater when he was a kid.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:50.840
It went on for years and years, everybody would go up and have a look at this great big hole in the field, wouldn't they?

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:56.840
No, we had over a few, because that's what they were aiming for, the tunnel, look, see?

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.840
See, that's what they were aiming for, the tunnel.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.840
Yeah.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:08.840
Because everything was going through the tunnel, look, everything, ammunition, you name it, everything was going through the tunnel.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:14.840
Presumably you could see across the estuary as well in Bristol what was going on there, could you, the bombing?

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:24.840
Well, not so much, really. Tell you, we've seen the barrage balloons, they had barrage balloons to stop them coming up through the water down there.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.840
You could see them.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.840
Really?

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:27.840
Why?

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.840
Big barrage balloons up in the sky.

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:35.840
Barrage balloons, that's to stop the planes coming down low, down the water.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.840
Did you have any guns on the sea front, on the sea wall?

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:41.840
No.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:42.840
Anything down there?

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.840
No.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:44.840
No.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:51.840
We still have today, we still today, still got the firing range, we still got the firing range where they go for practice now.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.840
Was that there when you were kids?

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:59.840
Oh, Christ yes, oh, we used to always be down there picking up shells on one thing and another.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:10.840
It belongs to Quent, training area, which had done them then, but my son used to run it, because he worked at them, so he ran the range.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.840
Oh, gosh.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.840
Yes, he ran it for years.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.840
Did you ever have any American soldiers here?

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.840
Oh, yes, all of them.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.840
Yes, one wanted to be my girlfriend.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.840
Give them a ride on your bike and you'd have a tin of fruit and a bit of gun.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.840
Really?

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:31.840
One wanted to be, and the dancehall in Chapstow wanted to be his girlfriend, wanted to be his girlfriend.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.840
Really?

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:38.840
With gold teeth he had, oh, why'd we have the anchor?

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.840
Was it good fun?

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:47.840
Well, shall we say, we have no, you didn't have transport and nothing there.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.840
Yeah.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:49:02.840
You only had to rely on somebody might put a bus on or you'd go by bus and then had to leave early then to catch the last bus back home and things like that, you know, everything was different.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:13.840
But I was only younger then, they used to park, they were all down Station Road, down to Ragapool or down there, and I used to go down on my little bike.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.840
And yeah, they used to say, can we have a ride?

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:23.840
You'd give them your bike and they went off and had a ride and then you'd have a tin of fruit and some gun.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.840
Really?

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.840
Yeah, the man was glad of that tin of fruit.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.840
Yeah, I bet she was.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:34.840
Yeah, of course I'd be that much older, she wasn't there then, you know, because she was so much older.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.840
So you went to dances with them, that must have been fun.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:41.840
Yeah, I went dancing every night of the week, I think.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.840
Oh no, I used to like dancing.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:45.840
Yeah.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:54.840
And we used to go to, as you said, we had our ordinary soldiers as well, up at Chepstow as well, besides the Yanks.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:50:02.840
And no, we used to, they used to have their dances and we used to go there and one thing and another.

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.840
Where were the dances?

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.840
In the hall, in their place, you know, in their camp.

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.840
We used to have a dance hall in Caldecott, didn't we?

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:19.840
I remember we had a YMCA in Caldecott, which we always had dances there and they used to come from there then,

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:25.840
Chepstow and all that, the boys did and the soldiers and one thing and another.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:30.840
Do you know any local group who ended up in America? Did anyone marry a GI?

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.840
Who, what she did, didn't she?

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.840
Oh.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:40.840
Oh, Rosie's friend lived opposite where the dentists is now.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:46.840
What was her name? And then that little cottage, she went off to America with the Yanks, didn't she?

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.840
I don't know.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.840
I don't remember any.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:55.840
Yeah. Were they, you know, opposite the Wix's fish and chip shop?

00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:02.840
The little cottages there, like Queenie, Queenie, Queenie somebody.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.840
She went off with the Yanks.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.840
Did any...

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:13.840
We had our good tang girls during the war, if you're right.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.840
We won one of them. We used to go there and dance for them, yes.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.840
Then come home.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:23.840
I remember dancing with an officer and he thought he was on for a good thing, he did.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:28.840
And he died then.

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:35.840
The soldiers then, the privates and all, you used to have excuse me dances and all then.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:43.840
And they would tap him on the shoulder and of course they'd be dancing and this is how we'd be ready to run it.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:55.840
So I've come towards, as the newer in the end then, that we was all, we either walked on from Cardiff to Roggett in a gang of us.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840
Yeah.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:08.840
Or then we said, so let's say that, oh I, oh I'd be going now soon that we're all going there.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:16.840
I got dropped like a bloody hot spud for the simple reason that he went and bloody got the bloody village bike.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.840
He did.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.840
The one that was known for it, you know.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.840
Yeah, yeah.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:28.840
And he went and bloody got her then when he knew he wasn't going to get nothing from her.

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.840
You're not mentioning her name.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.840
No.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.840
Yes, yes.

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.840
I know you're on the phone.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.840
So there was a lot of fun to be had as well.

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.840
Oh yes.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:47.840
Were the Americans ever billeted with local families?

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:48.840
No, no.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.840
They more or less only come overnight.

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:57.840
They were at Petrie Chap's store or somewhere locally they were.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:01.840
What about POWs? Were there ever POWs here?

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.840
Oh yes, at Le Martin.

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:05.840
Le Martin?

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.840
Yeah, we had the camp.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.840
Oh really?

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.840
Yes, yes, why?

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.840
Did they ever work on local farms?

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.840
Oh no, well they weren't in the farms anywhere.

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.840
They were just like local people.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:21.840
They were let out just like, no, I'm really, I don't go to any bar.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.840
Did any hang up, stay after the war?

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.840
Not as I know of.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.840
I don't know because I was only young then, you know.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.840
I was, I can't remember that.

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:38.840
We used to, two or three of us girls, well Olive and another friend of mine,

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.840
got very friendly with some Germans that we did.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.840
And we used to meet them down at Le Martin, one thing or another,

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:50.840
and have a picnic and all this that and the other.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:55.840
And then they got moved further up country somewhere.

00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:00.840
Oh no, we've had our moments.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.840
What about foods during the war?

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.840
Was there ever a black market in food and anything like that?

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:09.840
I don't think so.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.840
I can't remember.

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:15.840
Not in the village, I did think it was in Chepstow or somewhere like that,

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:21.840
or Newport, but in the village, I said it was small,

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:25.840
there wasn't all that many houses and all, you know, we were,

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:31.840
well, you know, it was quiet really, the quiet village.

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:35.840
And your father continued to work on the railway?

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.840
Oh, he never stopped until he retired.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.840
He never stopped.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:44.840
And we had a lot of firemen, oh a lot of that firemen,

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:49.840
they come during the war then, at the beginning of the war.

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.840
Some went to Bevan boys, didn't they, down the pits,

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:56.840
had to go down the pits, had to boys at a certain age.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:02.840
And then others, if they were on the railway, which was needed,

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.840
they were all sent up here and they got the lodge.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:12.840
It was a big hostel down by, well, where Lisa lives now, isn't it?

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.840
Eh?

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.840
Where Lisa lives now, there was a big hostel.

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.840
Oh really?

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.840
Yes, and the boys should...

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.840
And all the firemen, because of course they had to have a fireman

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:26.840
on the train to shun all the coal in, like do the dirty work.

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:30.840
Yes, some used to live in there and others went into lodgings.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:34.840
But a lot of our local girls all married them.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:35.840
Didn't they?

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:37.840
Oh, I went up with a couple of them.

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.840
You lived in the village married the hostel boys?

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.840
Oh, we never.

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:47.840
Yes, there used to be, that's either lodge, if you had a room,

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.840
you could let a lodger, which is payable, you know.

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.840
And if not, you had to go in the hostel.

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.840
So where did they come from? All over the place?

00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.840
If they were on the railway?

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.840
Yes, they were all sent from the valleys one day,

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.840
all out to work on the railway, see.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.840
But if they wanted to work, if you know what I mean,

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:13.840
and they were wanted on the thing, they had to go, it's as simple as that.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.840
We could do with a bit of that, no way.

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.840
We could do with a bit of it, no.

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.840
Yeah, well I could.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.840
What about, where did you go shopping? Did you ever go shopping?

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.840
No, we never went shopping.

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:31.840
We had a little shop on the main road.

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:37.840
And then we had Gutsy Glees around the corner selling a bit of groceries.

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.840
And another one was, tell you something, the oil man,

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:45.840
he used to come round with oil, didn't he?

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:50.840
And for the simple reason that we didn't have electric,

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:58.840
we had gas mantles, and with the thing where you pull down, like that.

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.840
But of course, so you had to have your oil locked, see.

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.840
So this, from Magor I think he was.

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.840
Would he be delivered in cartons?

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.840
No, no, no, in more of things.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.840
What, ladled out?

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:17.840
Any make do, word things, you know, there weren't all this,

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.840
like there is no don't do this, don't do that.

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:20.840
Really?

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.840
You've done everything you wanted to do that.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.840
What about milk, was that delivered in churns?

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.840
Oh, milk, my sister.

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.840
Oh, you haven't got to look back, milk, yes.

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:36.840
When they left school, they used to ask me, farm.

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:41.840
They had a great big dairy, and their own cows.

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:45.840
And me, when she left school, she went out there to work.

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:46.840
What, milking cows?

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:50.840
No, but doing them, filling the bottles with milk.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:51.840
Really? Yeah.

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:57.840
And then we had to put little cardboard little rings on the top, you know.

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:02.840
And then she put them in front of her bike with a basket, and go round delivering.

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.840
Round the village with the basket.

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.840
And I used to follow her on my three wheeler.

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:11.840
They were only half pikes, weren't they?

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:14.840
Yeah, so you could have half a pint or a pint.

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:19.840
And as I said, the farm yard where we buzzed at, you had the fresh milk,

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.840
as they milked the cows in the morning, six o'clock.

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.840
We had our milk, the milk at seven or eight o'clock in the morning.

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:31.840
Fresh milk, none of this pasteurised and all this half a dozen of other.

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:36.840
And as I said, Mae used to go up then at night time, didn't she,

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.840
and get these little bottles to take around.

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.840
You could have a small one in the morning and a small one at night.

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.840
Yeah, they used to do little half pikes, didn't they?

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:45.840
Yeah.

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.840
And she used to go on her bike.

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:52.840
And I told you about these ducks, I don't know whether you've seen it,

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:58.840
on the news this week about the three ducks terrorising a village.

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.840
No, I don't think it was on the telly this week.

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.840
Well, they used to have one, Smithy's farm.

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.840
We used to hate to go up there and we'd keep her out because they had three.

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.840
Ducks hated her and they were vicious.

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:21.840
Honestly, there were, well, no one used to say that they were better than a dog.

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.840
It'd been like a geese, geese would like that.

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.840
Geese, yeah, that's what it was.

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:26.840
Oh, geese, was it?

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.840
Oh, geese are vicious.

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:30.840
But it was on the telly.

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:36.840
They'd already got geese in the village and they made pets of them.

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:41.840
But these three come from somewhere and they've been terrorising the village.

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.840
I don't know whether it was this week.

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:47.840
Terrorising the village and the cats and the dogs and everything else.

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.840
So they were open, they would go away.

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:58.840
It made me think then of when Mae was up there and we used to look up the driveway.

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.840
Go down there and get the conkers.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.840
On that tree.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.840
On that tree.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.840
On that tree, big conker trees, we used to get the conkers, didn't we?

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.840
Yeah.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.840
They were yibbly yibbly yonker.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.840
Old driveway, the driveway of conkers.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.840
Where was that?

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.840
Where was the driveway of conkers?

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.840
Oh, opposite the garage, the Stonier.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.840
Yeah, opposite the garage.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.840
None of their houses was there then.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.840
That was all fields and just the farm.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:29.840
If you'd have seen that then, there was only two little cottage bungalows,

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.840
workers bungalows, we'll put it that way.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.840
Yeah, there was a little row like that about four cottages going that way.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.840
They worked up the farm, didn't they?

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.840
Yeah, Mrs. Ewer and all that.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.840
And then it was co-sheds and lots of...

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.840
That's right, that big shed.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.840
But there was a great big...

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.840
To go around, wasn't there?

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.840
I said, if only anybody...

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.840
But we didn't have the cameras and the money then, see, to take these photographs.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:08.840
Otherwise, if we'd have taken photographs of all these different places that have...

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.840
Have only...

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:10.840
No gone.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.840
I mean, see, even that old bridge, it would have just changed now over there.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.840
Yeah, the black bridge.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.840
It was like that, now it's been like that for 80, 90 years.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.840
And now they've put a new one there.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.840
You know that...

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:32.840
You don't see it, so of course you don't think about, well, we didn't have the money.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.840
We didn't have cameras then, I don't think so.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:39.840
So until you're doing a project like this, because hearing your stories, I can see it in my head,

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.840
it'd be lovely to have images, wouldn't it, of these things.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.840
Did you have any...

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:51.840
Were there any locals, you know, myths or legends or stories you used to tell each other?

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.840
Or superstitions, local superstitions, things like that?

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.840
I can't remember none of that.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.840
Terry was telling me about roping weddings.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.840
Oh yeah, we used to rope the weddings, didn't you?

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.840
Oh yeah, where they roped them, yeah.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.840
Yeah, they roped the weddings.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:08.840
Over the church, yeah.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.840
They used to throw out all their coppers.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.840
Yeah.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:14.840
That's right, they'd throw out their coppers, that's right.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.840
Oh yes, that old tradition.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.840
Well, that's gone now, that's gone.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.840
Well, Terry used to do that when he was a kid.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:23.840
Yeah, he said.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.840
So would you have been aware of wildlife as children?

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.840
Would you have known what was around the area?

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.840
Flowers and birds and insects and animals?

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.840
Not really, not really.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.840
Flowers? Because the fields were full of flowers, weren't they?

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.840
I think it was because we had so much of them.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.840
Yes.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.840
You know what I mean.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:48.840
The woods was full of bluebells and then the fields would be full of cove slips.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.840
You know, everything like that.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.840
There was nothing ploughed up then, was there?

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.840
No.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.840
And the fields were all just wild flowers, weren't they?

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.840
And when we went to Caldecott or a man would take one of us

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.840
or her in the pasture or something and go into Caldecott,

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.840
it was great edges each side.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.840
And, you know, were there any orchards around?

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.840
Were there any orchards?

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.840
Well, orchards, yes, but only in small.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.840
You'd go up country more for the big orchards.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:27.840
They used to have loads of apple trees, didn't they?

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.840
Like a big orchard at the Battle of the Red Tree.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.840
Walnut tree.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.840
They had a big walnut tree, didn't they?

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.840
They used to go up there and get walnuts, yeah.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840
Did you?

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.840
Yes.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:44.840
One thing our dad used to do, he wasn't a man to play with us as kids,

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.840
if you know what I mean.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:53.840
But he always used to take us up the woods on a Sunday morning

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.840
out of our mam's way while she was getting the dinner.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.840
Really?

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.840
And then this is where the walnut tree used to come in.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.840
We used to get the walnuts then and he used to pickle them, didn't he?

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:12.840
And then we came back and Johnny the ice cream man would be somewhere around,

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.840
wouldn't he?

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.840
Back on the green.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:22.840
And you know, you might not believe it, but dad used to get a penny worth,

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.840
because money was money then, mind,

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.840
pennies worth of ice cream in a glass.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.840
And that's how we'd share it between us.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.840
Because there was no money around to throw away out there.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.840
No, not for ice cream.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.840
And what was Johnny, was he?

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:44.840
But he always seemed to be somewhere near when we'd come back down from the woods,

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.840
didn't we?

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.840
Yeah.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:50.840
And we'd have a penny worth of ice cream in this.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840
Share it.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840
Really?

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.840
No, it's a...

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:58.840
So you call this the Moors, this is the Moors.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:06.840
Do you know, so, places like Redwick and Goldcliff and Nash,

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.840
would you know that area much?

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.840
Would you ever go there?

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.840
No, we never went down there, really.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:12.840
No.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.840
Mam did, Mam worked down there.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:22.840
When Mam was 12, she left school and she was working in this big house at Redwick.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.840
Oh, really?

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:27.840
She had to walk there in the morning and walk home at night back to Cloudycar.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.840
And how far was that?

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.840
Eight miles, something like that.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.840
I remember her working down there, but I'm not coming with boys.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.840
Yeah, she always told me when she left at 12, she had to walk because there was no transport.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.840
No.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.840
And it was a job, she was sent there to work.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.840
As a maid?

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.840
This big house, you know, cleaning, just cleaning.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.840
You don't know the name of the house?

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.840
No.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.840
No.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.840
And, yeah, she had to walk.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.840
That was very...

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.840
Redwick, did you just...

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.840
Redwick, yeah, she had to walk.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.840
Oh, really?

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.840
I mean, that's quite a long way, isn't it?

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.840
They left school at 12 in Memphis.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:01.840
Yeah.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:02.840
Gosh.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.840
Yes, well, I left when I was 14.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.840
They won all these exams and all this that and the other.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.840
Oh, no.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.840
We never had nothing, did we?

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.840
What about Lanwerne?

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.840
Did that ever affect you, the steelworks?

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.840
The what?

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.840
The steelworks at Lanwerne, is that...

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:24.840
The only thing that affected us was the noise and the mess and the dust going past our house

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.840
because our house was there on the mighty corner of the road

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:32.840
and the lorries streaming by all the time from the quarry.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.840
Oh, for the sale?

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:40.840
Very busy, very busy road with the lorries for Redlam-Werne.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.840
Yeah.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:47.840
But after that, you know, once it was built, that was the end of it, as the saying is.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.840
Yeah.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.840
So a lot of these houses had gone up.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:54.840
But then they'd gone up to accommodate workers at Lanwerne.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.840
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.840
No, no, they were put up.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:03.840
But most of the people came from the valleys to work in Lanwerne and they lived in the houses.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.840
They weren't especially put up for them.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.840
Yeah.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.840
No, these were...

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:08.840
Oh, council houses.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.840
Most of these were railway houses.

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.840
Really?

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.840
They were.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.840
There must have been so many people who worked on the railway.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:16.840
Yeah, there must have been.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.840
There must have been so many people who worked on the railway.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.840
Yeah, but you know, we all saw a man working on the railway, didn't we?

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.840
Well, I was going to say that was their main stay.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:31.840
Because it was such a big place here, you know, years ago, Seven Tunnel was famous, you know.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:32.840
Yeah.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.840
It's hard to imagine what it was like.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.840
Yes.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.840
Yeah.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:41.840
It would have been a good place if you'd have gone in and had a look, and that is over the chapel over here.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.840
Yeah.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:47.840
Because, tell you what, I run the walls in there, they've got a lot of railway memorabilia.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.840
Yeah, they have, yeah.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:51.840
In the chapel here, over there.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.840
What, is it open?

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.840
No, you don't have to see it.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.840
No, I don't think so.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.840
You don't have to see Coral.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.840
But there's a lot of railway stuff.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.840
Yeah, is it a Methodist chapel?

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.840
I'll tell you another thing.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.840
It's a Rocket Non-Political Club.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:12.840
Dad was one of the first members of the...

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.840
When it was a little shack, a couple of men made a little shack together.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.840
Really?

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:18.840
He was one of the...

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.840
Dad helped build it.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.840
...memorabilia.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.840
You know, the people that started it.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.840
One of the founders.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.840
Yeah.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.840
I found hundreds of it.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:28.840
Yes.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:29.840
Oh, really?

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:30.840
Yeah.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:31.840
So is that still open today?

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.840
Yes.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.840
Oh, yes.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.840
And where is it?

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.840
Ken's playing over there next week.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.840
Oh, is he?

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:37.840
Oh, yes.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.840
He practically lives there.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840
It's all right, Father.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:40.840
My son lives over there, isn't it?

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:41.840
Where is it?

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.840
Over here, did you say?

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.840
Yeah.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.840
Over there.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:46.840
Yeah, Non-Political Club.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.840
So I would go to the end of the road.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.840
Yeah.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:51.840
And turn right?

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.840
Yeah.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.840
Go right up to the end.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:54.840
Yeah.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.840
And then you see it.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:56.840
And it's there.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.840
Next to the hairdresser is a room by the corner by an hairdresser.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.840
Really?

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.840
I can't believe that.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.840
Yeah, that's...

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:03.840
And the chapel is out onto the main road.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.840
On the way down into...

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.840
They're all on the same road.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:06.840
Yeah, on the same road.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:07.840
Really?

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.840
So does the chapel still have people going there for...

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.840
Oh, yes.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:14.840
Oh, yes.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:15.840
It's a very thriving place.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.840
Really?

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:17.840
Yes.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:18.840
Oh, yes, very thriving.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:19.840
Perhaps I should try and go and see that.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.840
Yes, I got a lot of...

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.840
You'd have to see Coral.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.840
Yeah.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.840
Coral Yates.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.840
Yeah.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:25.840
Because she does a lot for the chapel.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:26.840
Does she?

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:27.840
Yeah, she spends a lot of time there, doesn't she?

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.840
Yeah, she's a part of the chapel.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.840
So as young women and you wanted to get your hair done or you wanted to go and buy a dress

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.840
or a frock, where would you go?

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:36.840
Oh, we'd get our hair done.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:37.840
You can have your hair done.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.840
Oh, well, that wasn't there.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.840
I mean, it was a bit of a mess.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:40.840
Yeah.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:42.840
Oh, we never had a hair done then.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:43.840
Oh, we never had a hair done then.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.840
Mam used to cut it.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:45.840
Mam used to cut a fringe.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:46.840
Really?

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.840
She used to have fringe, but I never...

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.840
I always had curly hair.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:49.840
She had curls.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:50.840
The way we hair, I had a ribbon in mine.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.840
Really?

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.840
Yeah, Mam used to...

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:53.840
Because it was curly, Mam used to put it in ranks overnight.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.840
And then when she got up in the morning, she had all these...

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:55.840
Really?

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.840
Oh, yes.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.840
Coral was always hanging down her back.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840
I was always down there.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.840
She was different to us.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.840
She was a foreigner.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:01.840
Oh, yeah.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.840
Oh, yeah.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:03.840
Oh, yeah.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.840
Oh, yeah.

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840
Oh, yeah.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.840
Oh, yeah.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.840
Oh, yeah.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.840
Oh, yeah.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.840
That...

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:13.840
No, that...

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.840
No, we never did.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.840
I mean, I was only saying...

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:25.840
We've said, no, when we think that all the dances and that I went to during the war and

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:29.840
one thing and another and that, but we never had no money for...

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:34.840
I don't know what clothes and that we wore because now if you're going anywhere, you're

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.840
spending a fortune buying this and the other to go to it, wouldn't you?

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.840
Yeah.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.840
And the dance and all this.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.840
But I don't know what we did then.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.840
Yeah, I don't think we did then.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.840
Did your mum make clothes?

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:46.840
Did she have a sewing machine?

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:47.840
No.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.840
Did she?

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.840
No.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.840
No.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:51.840
I don't know what she made.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.840
No, she didn't know.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.840
She had a sewing machine, but she didn't make clothes, did she?

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.840
No, I don't remember.

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.840
As I can remember, I don't know where we got our clothes from.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.840
I suppose we had hand in me, don't I suppose?

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.840
As the five girls we bound, I suppose we bound.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.840
I know I had hand down from all this.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.840
I did.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:10.840
I know, but perhaps we did on some things.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.840
I know we used to wear them best with the buttons down the front.

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840
Do you remember them?

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840
Oh, was that a Liberty bodice?

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.840
A Liberty bodice, yes.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.840
Everyone wore those, didn't they?

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.840
We had them.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.840
We had them.

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:31.840
So when did it start to change?

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.840
When did the houses start to go up?

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.840
When did it start to develop here?

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:39.840
Well, when the steelworks really, didn't it?

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:45.840
Before, well, where I'm living now, they put up little bungalows, didn't they?

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.840
Oh, that's right, yes.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:54.840
And I don't really know where they went.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:12:00.840
I first lived when I got married.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.840
There was a field there, and we used to call it the sandpit.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:05.840
Yeah.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:10.840
Because it was just a rough old piece of ground.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:11.840
Yeah.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.840
I ended up living in one of them.

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:14.840
Really?

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:22.840
When I, you know, one day after I got married, went to living rooms.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.840
Then we went up to Underwood.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:30.840
And then a man from Rogget, then our councillor, came up there and told me that there's an

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:35.840
house going in, Rogget, he said, if you would like it.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:41.840
And it turned out to be just the one I liked with a bay window on the end house.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:42.840
Really?

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.840
But that's always, we used to call that the sandpit, because it was rough ground.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.840
Yeah.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.840
The same as Rogget Poole, that was always underwater, wasn't it?

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.840
That was water, yeah.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.840
That's why it's called the Poole, Rogget Poole, because it's all underwater.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.840
Now it's all houses.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.840
Really?

01:12:58.840 --> 01:12:59.840
Yeah.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:00.840
I wonder what stopped it getting flooded.

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:05.840
There wasn't many houses, you're a tally one proud.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.840
No, there wasn't, I think, only railway houses until they put them in the bungalows.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.840
That's right, there'd be old stone-built houses.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.840
They put some stone-built houses.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.840
Weren't they?

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.840
People, they come from away, I don't know why, didn't they?

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.840
They were all from away that come to the bungalows.

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:25.840
And then they knocked them all down the bungalows and then put all them council houses.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.840
Oh really?

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.840
Do you ever think about that you're below sea level here?

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:31.840
Do you ever think about that?

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.840
No, not really.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.840
Mind?

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:41.840
The tide have come in a field, it have come in a field, I think it was about two and a

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.840
half fields or more when we was kids to get down to it.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.840
Dad said he remembers it once when he was a kid, he'd come up the station as far as

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.840
the station.

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.840
Did he?

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.840
Yeah, when dad was a child he told him.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.840
Oh really?

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:56.840
I don't remember it.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:05.840
But I do know that, not now so much because they put a sea wall there, but before it was

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.840
gradually coming over, instead of three fields, it was two fields.

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:11.840
Really?

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:17.840
And there'd be a ream and where we'd have to jump over it to get into the next field

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.840
and things like that.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:25.840
But of course that have stopped now because they sort of put, you know.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.840
The motorway come through, didn't it?

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.840
What was that like when the motorway came through?

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.840
Do you remember that?

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.840
Well I remember all those motorways.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:38.840
Does it make a big difference?

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.840
Well this one here, you mean this motorway here?

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:43.840
Yeah.

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.840
No, the one down there, the new one.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:49.840
Down the, not the old one.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.840
No, I know the one you mean.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.840
The new one down.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.840
I got a photo of one of them.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.840
Because it had to go through.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:00.840
I got a photo of them as they were building the bridge over the road.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:01.840
Really?

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:07.840
Because we was going to Newport one day and they put lights there as they were doing it.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.840
They had lights there, you know, stop and go like.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.840
So when they'd stop and I took a photo of it.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.840
But now...

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.840
It went right through the rifle range.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.840
They had to build a new rifle range because the motorway went through the old one.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.840
Because Ray was there then working.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:32.840
Oh yes, this motorway you're at, you know, cut through.

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:43.840
We used to have half a dozen or more lanes quite near that we go up to the woods anywhere

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.840
and anywhere, you know.

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.840
And there's Mrs. Norm.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:54.840
The windmill, what they call the windmill lane, where the windmill is up there.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.840
You've seen the windmill, have you?

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:57.840
No.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.840
You mean the very big one?

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:00.840
Aye.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.840
No, it's only a ruin but you know.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.840
Okay.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.840
There's the windmill.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.840
I can see the windmill from here.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.840
You mean it's an old windmill?

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.840
It's always been there.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.840
Yeah, it's always been called the windmill.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:17.840
We don't know how many years it's been there.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.840
A woman there, Mrs. North, used to live up there.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.840
There used to be two little stone bungalows there at the top of this lane.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:27.840
Yeah.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:33.840
And she used to have to walk all the way down the lane because she had no water in there

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:40.840
and a tap down the bottom of the lane that got purely down to Rocket Pool on the main road one day.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.840
They used to have to come down and get their bucket of water.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:44.840
Really?

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:50.840
And when David says that with Turkey Tump they had to go to the well, didn't they?

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.840
Oh, there was a well there when we were kids, wasn't there?

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.840
They had to get there and get the well.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:55.840
Where's Turkey Tump?

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.840
At the Minnitz.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:57.840
Really?

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.840
So this is when you were children?

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:00.840
Yeah.

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:01.840
Yeah.

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.840
Someone said that he, this is somebody on the other side of the usk at Marshfield,

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.840
he said he used to drink out of the ream.

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.840
Have you ever done that?

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.840
They would drink water from a ream.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.840
No, no, no.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:17.840
No.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:18.840
No.

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.840
Well, I never did.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:27.840
Have you got any photographs of your childhood or your father or anything like that?

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.840
There's a photo there, there, look, of the five of us.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:31.840
We're going to dress five as kids.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.840
Oh, don't you look lovely.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.840
And you'll see, you'll see I got a hat on.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:38.840
What?

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.840
That, and do you know why?

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.840
Because I used to get so fed up of people saying,

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.840
what beautiful hair she got, what beautiful hair she got.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.840
And I would always have her head on the side.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.840
Oh my God, isn't that lovely?

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.840
So lovely.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.840
And your hair's all pretty much the same, but you're...

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.840
Yes, obviously she always wore a hat.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:06.840
I said they used to call me copper top because I said it's nice to hear that everybody says,

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.840
oh, what beautiful hair, what beautiful hair.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.840
Oh, I got bloody fed up with it.

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.840
I used to say, oh, I'm going to be a beauty queen.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.840
I used to say, oh, I'm going to be a beauty queen.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.840
Oh, I got bloody fed up with it.

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:21.840
I used to say, and I always used to wear a tan then.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.840
Oh, lovely.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.840
But I used to get fed up with it.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.840
Do you see the difference in me now to Rose?

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:31.840
Yes.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.840
You know, it's so many years.

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:34.840
Yeah.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:38.840
She used to look after me when I was born because she put lead in Luxie.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.840
Was your mum working?

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.840
Yes, my mum always worked.

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:43.840
What did she do?

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:48.840
Well, she only worked in later life, didn't she, when she went up the hospital?

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.840
No, she worked at the Box Works for years.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.840
Did she?

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:53.840
Yes, my mum did.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.840
I got a photo of her working at the Box Works.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:56.840
Where's the Box Works?

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.840
At Potskiewicz.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.840
Oh, really?

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:00.840
Don't ask me what they've done there.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.840
I don't know.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:02.840
It's called the Box Works.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.840
I don't remember that.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:09.840
My only time I remember, ma'am, is when she went to work up at the St Lawrence Hospital.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.840
Oh, wow, that was later life.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:12.840
And later, I know.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.840
They were married and all that.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:16.840
Divorced.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:21.840
What are any other local characters you remember here?

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.840
Who was that?

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:27.840
We used to have big carnivals here years ago.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.840
What is that?

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.840
Yeah.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:30.840
Carnival, yeah.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.840
I've got photos of that.

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.840
That's been my photograph.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:37.840
Chrissie, Ivy's daughter was under once.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.840
Oh, she was five years old.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.840
I remember the carnival queen.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:46.840
And her dad drove the lorry over onto a field over there.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:48.840
That's right, yeah.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.840
Yeah, big carnivals years ago, we used to have.

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:58.840
Yes, I got some photos in my other little box of photos, because we got Andrzej's now.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.840
I got Chrissie on the cart, I don't know.

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:06.840
And I got them with the people marching up the street and one thing and another, but of course.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.840
Yeah.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.840
And you were part of the carnival?

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.840
Yes.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.840
She was a character more than in one, she was.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.840
She was good.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.840
She used to do all sorts of things.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.840
What sorts of things?

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.840
She was good, Mrs. Trinidad.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.840
Was she Irish?

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:21.840
I don't think so.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.840
Name like that.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:23.840
I don't know.

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.840
I don't know where she came from.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:25.840
But if you had any trouble.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.840
Well, I suppose lots of communities would have had somebody like that, wouldn't they,

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.840
at one time?

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.840
Yeah.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.840
And actually played an important role, didn't they, really?

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.840
Yeah.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.840
You know?

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.840
Every finish would have a midwife.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.840
Another one used to be, lived just down the road, what was her name?

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:47.840
I bet you'd tell her that she'd be out sweeping that bloody pavement and by her gate, if she'd

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:53.840
swept that pavement once during the day, she'd sweep under there and she'd be sweeping it

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:59.840
and sweeping it until somebody come along and once they did, whoop, really, talk, talk.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:04.840
But she was always sweeping the pavement out the front.

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.840
Who was that?

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.840
Eh?

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:07.840
Who was that?

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.840
I can't think of her name now.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:14.840
She had a son.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.840
She did.

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.840
But she'd always be out there.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:19.840
Where did she live then?

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.840
Just out next to one.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:25.840
Oh.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:35.840
That councillor, as I told you, what was it that come up and got me that house?

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:40.840
Where did Phyllis Andrews live?

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.840
Yeah, I know where Phyllis lived at the road, aye.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:44.840
I know.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:45.840
How does it, can you?

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.840
Well, next door, down on...

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.840
Mr Walker.

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.840
That Mr Walker was the councillor?

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.840
That Mr Walker was the one that come up and got me the house, aye.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.840
Aye.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:59.840
One of them two houses there, but she was always sweeping them out, even if one of yours

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.840
try and miss her.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.840
Cantles lived on the corner.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:04.840
Who?

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:05.840
Cantles.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:06.840
Trevor Cantles.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:07.840
Aye, that was earlier.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:08.840
He was a kid, Trevor Cantles.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.840
One of them went abroad, didn't they, to live, didn't they?

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.840
No, there was only Trevor Cantles.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.840
Trevor?

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.840
Oh no, there was a daughter, wasn't there?

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:18.840
Yes, I think she went abroad to live.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.840
Yeah.

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:25.840
How many people living here now, would you say, have been here for all their lives?

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.840
Are they very...

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:29.840
Not a lot.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.840
Not a lot.

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:37.840
Because there are nearly every houses that have been put up have been people have come

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:42.840
from down Wales way or somewhere, more often not down town, isn't it?

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.840
Yeah, from the valleys.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:49.840
I would say a lot of people come here from the valleys when the council houses went up

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.840
to work at Lambwood.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:55.840
Because I know we keep saying, oh Christ, when a lot of them, nobody knows.

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.840
I would say I got...

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:58.840
Nobody in the street.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.840
I got neighbours now.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:05.840
I never see, there's, they're rented, they're renting it.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:09.840
But I never see them.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.840
I don't even know their names.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:20.840
That panel in the fence, they said, I'm waiting for the landlord to put a new panel in there.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:28.840
And these two here, I never see them because they're both working and they're two kids

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.840
have come, grown up all while I've been here.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:32.840
Really?

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:33.840
But I never see them.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.840
You like them, don't you?

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:36.840
They don't get no bad.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:43.840
The thing of this street now, you go all down this street and then cross over and come back up.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:48.840
There's nobody here living here now than when we was kids.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.840
Because they're all young people.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:24:00.840
The only one here is John Michael, when he lived on the main road when we was kids.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.840
But he lives in this street now.

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:03.840
And that big house.

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.840
Anybody else in this street, they didn't live here when we were children.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:12.840
That's one thing I miss is my friend, she was living next door.

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:18.840
And we went everywhere together, holidays and all sorts of things.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:24.840
And night time we'd be sat out under the trees down there with a cup of tea or something.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:27.840
And good old Natter, she was as good as gold, she was.

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:28.840
Wasn't she awful, awesome.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.840
I mean, she'd do everything.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:35.840
And, but no, you don't see...

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:36.840
I don't see my neighbours.

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.840
You don't see anybody.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:39.840
You don't see anybody.

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:46.840
Everybody keeps theirself or they're out working and they just don't bother.

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:50.840
It's a bit of a shame, doesn't it? It feels a shame.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.840
Did you ever go to church or chapel as children?

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.840
Oh yeah, we used to go to church and chapel.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.840
Did you?

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.840
Yeah, we'd go to chapel one week and church the next week.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.840
Whoever we were friends with.

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.840
And then we could go on the two outings to Barry.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:07.840
Didn't we? Whoever we were friends with, we used to go Europe.

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.840
Yeah, well, it used to go different to me, you know.

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.840
When I was a kid, I used to go to chapel one week and church the other.

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:17.840
And then we could have, my minn, that was an outing to go to Barry.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:18.840
On the train?

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:24.840
On the train. That was, you know, it was an organised, fish and chip dinner.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:28.840
And two shillings in a packet to spend on the fare.

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.840
Oh, the thrill with those shillings.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.840
Two shillings, you know.

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.840
That was a great thing to go to Barry Island.

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.840
Yeah, to go to Barry for the day, can't.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.840
So we had two trips to Barry because we'd go into both places.

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:47.840
What about, did you ever have, I've spoken to people who've talked about

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:51.840
they used to go skating on the reams in the winter.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.840
Did you ever have anything like that?

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:54.840
No.

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:55.840
Can't remember.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:56.840
No.

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:57.840
Going down the hill.

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.840
Not a big enough piece of, the only ponds we had,

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:06.840
and that wasn't big enough to, you know, not skate on it.

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:10.840
No, not the reams. I shouldn't have thought the reams were that wide, were they?

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:11.840
Eh?

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.840
The reams. You know.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.840
What?

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.840
The reams. They weren't that wide, were they?

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.840
No, all the way down.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.840
Only wide enough to put a stile over them.

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:21.840
We could jump over them, couldn't we?

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:23.840
Yeah, we used to jump over the reams.

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.840
Did you?

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.840
What, with a pole?

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.840
No, just run and jump over the reams.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:29.840
Really?

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:32.840
And your foot went in, your foot went in.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.840
Did you ever fall in?

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:35.840
I can't remember.

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.840
Probably had some wet feet I spent.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.840
I can't remember.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.840
Did you ever, did you ever, you make boats for the reams?

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.840
No.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:45.840
No.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:46.840
No.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.840
No.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.840
No.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:49.840
No.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.840
That's a...

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.840
Shall I turn this off now?

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:54.840
Shall I?

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:55.840
Shall I?

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.840
Shall I turn it off?

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:59.840
That is absolutely fantastic.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:00.840
Oh my goodness.
