WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
So this is Fiona Liddell, one of the volunteers with Friends of Cardiff Reservoirs and I'm

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.800
talking to Annie Smith and we are at the Lisvane and Stanisian Reservoirs. So Annie, thank

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.760
you for agreeing to take part in this project.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.760
My pleasure.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:25.920
So can you tell me when you were employed with Welsh Water, perhaps go back to 2020,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.400
what was your role?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.320
I'm Annie Smith and my role with Lisvane and Stanisian was when I first started working

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.640
for Welsh Water as the Enroll Partnership Manager, which is the Enabling Natural Resources

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:53.200
and Wellbeing Partnership Manager. I saw the job advertised, which had an element of all

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.320
of the ecological side of protecting the site and also engaging with the community and

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.400
working with the community. It was quite a unique job description that you don't really

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.920
see come up every day and it caught my eye. I remember showing it to one of the lecturers

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.000
at the university and saying, what do you think about this job description? And he said,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.800
that's written for somebody, nobody's got all of that. And I said, well, I have. I have,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.680
I've got all the community side of things and the communication side of things, but

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.920
also background in environmental law management. So we won't apply for them. But don't be

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.560
surprised if it's written for somebody. Anyway, so I went for a job interview in August or

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.840
September in 2019. I was interviewed by Richard Cowie, who was chair of the Reservoir Action

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.880
Group, Nicola from Cardiff Council and Vicki Martin, who was the Head of Visitor Attractions

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:04.160
at Rush Water. And anyway, I got the job. And that's how I came to work for Rush Water

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.600
on a two-year contract to deliver the NREL grant, which is Rush Government Funded Grant,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.880
to do what it says on the tin, enable natural resources and help you. You don't have to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.640
prompt me now. What was the question?

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.000
If your role was an engagement officer, what did that mean? Who did you engage with and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.600
for what purpose?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:43.320
So Rush Water took over the site in 2016 after the campaign to save it had come to fruition.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.560
And they were very keen to make sure that they kept the community involved in that journey

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.960
and any future plans that were taking place. So the intention was, it was proposed by the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.720
Reservoir Action Group to set up a Friends of Group, the community wanted to set up Friends

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.640
of Group. And through the NREL grant, there was an opportunity to take that element of

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.760
the community engagement forward really. And it was a really good vehicle to kind of get

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.160
the community engaged with the future plans of the site and what we're going to do with

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.760
the future plans of the site.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.960
So my role as partnership manager was to work with the community, work with both our Action

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.680
Group, work with the cloud of council, help set up the systems for a Friends of Group

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:44.400
and put into place certain elements that would enable the public to be able to come back

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.840
on site whilst protecting the ecology. So it's kind of that balancing act of getting that

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.280
message out to the community that we do want to open it up to the community, we do want

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.920
to open it up to the public, but we will only be able to do so if we do it in a way that

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.440
also protects the environment. Working with our regulators, Natural Resources Wales, working

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.720
colleagues such as Dam Safety to make sure that everything we were doing was safe and

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:26.120
in line with policies and regulations, while also being able to let the community have

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:35.840
an input and how they want to be able to use this site and save the site for future generations.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.000
Can you tell us what was Welsh Water's vision really for the way this place looks and feels

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.920
and is used?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:51.560
So Welsh Water already had existing visitor attraction sites. They had four open. They

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.000
got Llandegfair, Llysfron, went up in North Wales, Brenneg and went right in the middle

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.480
of Wyadah, Ellan Valley. So I think they already had sort of like an idea in their head that

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.480
they would like to develop this into a visitor attraction site. That helps enable people

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.080
to access the water for safer recreation use as well because obviously reservoirs are

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.480
quite dangerous if they're not in that safe environment. But they also needed to do it

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.680
in a way that engaged the local community. So I think out of all of the different sites,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.160
this was the trickiest one because it's the only one that is in the middle of a city.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.240
The immediate population surrounding it is about 30,000 people, whereas all of our other

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.680
sites people have to drive to that in quite rural locations. So I think it was constantly

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.760
that sort of like balancing act, but they knew that vision of bringing people in touch

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:06.600
with the outdoors, the water, the green infrastructure. That was always one of their main visions.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:15.520
And the overall vision of the visitor attraction sites is to support the wellbeing.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.640
Thank you. So can you describe for us what was the work that was undertaken in order

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:28.560
to develop what we see here today? So to create the Friends of group, Washed Water

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:35.560
hadn't done that before. So as you can imagine, Washed Water undertake lots of capital infrastructure

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:44.400
projects, a lot of it quite dangerous. We use a lot of contractors. So to use volunteers

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.760
on our lands delivering projects was a new concept to them. So that was one of my first

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:57.680
kind of, I suppose, tasks really to have a look at how we can make that happen, how we

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.240
can understand, how we can work with community as volunteers on our land and to take in some

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:12.400
of our projects. So in the background, I had to put together policies to make that happen,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.000
work with Reservoir Action Group to understand how they wanted Friends of group formed. Reservoir

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.560
Action Group, rightly so, had a campaign, it was a campaign group, it was to save the

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.400
reservoir, whereas the Friends of group was to work in partnership with Washed Water.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:37.200
So we took that bill to work in partnership element of it. They wanted to be independent

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.840
of Washed Water, but to work with us. And that's kind of as the basis of forming the

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:53.400
policy, working with directors of health and safety, legal, just to make that happen. So

00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:01.280
it was really the trigger of how Washed Water did that. And now the volunteering manager

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.000
has got that system set up across our sites across the whole of Wales. So it really was

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.280
not just what helped happen here on this site, but what's happening across Wales.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:18.200
So that was one element. Once we got that set up, we were able then to actually do some

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:26.640
volunteering work in between a pandemic, which was a bit tricky. It was a bit stop and start.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.760
But once we were able to get people out on the site, get people into woodlands, get people

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:40.680
on site, that was brilliant. The NREL grant also helped fund the pathways that we see,

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.360
which means that people were able to walk around the site, which is protected as a SSSI

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:52.520
for the grass and fungi. So again, adding to that wellbeing element. They also funded

00:08:52.520 --> 00:09:00.200
things like the bird hides, a few activities, some equipment for the Friends of group. And

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:06.440
also one thing that was kind of a bit of a spur of the moment, but worked out really well is

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:15.240
creating the dry stone walls as well. I really enjoyed doing that project. The pilot one was

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:22.840
just the Dry Stone Wall Association, myself and the late chair of the Friends of group,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:30.840
who came out on a very miserable December day and built the stone wall. But the idea of that,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.680
it was utilising all of the stonework that had been left over from the restoration of the reservoir

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:46.520
and create something for nature. So it should hopefully outlast all of us. So that was quite

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.400
good. During the project, I realised there's potential in the woodlands as well.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:59.800
That was something that I think the focus had been on the visitor attraction building, the site,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:07.240
surrounding reservoirs and land, but also attached to the site are some ancient woodlands

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:14.760
and some recreation woodlands. And fortunately, at the time that the First Minister wanted to

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:22.760
create a national woodland, a forest for whales. And we were successful in getting one of the first

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:29.080
grants. And again, working with the Friends of group, we created nature trails, story trails.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:37.720
We took out invasive species, we reclaimed ponds and all of that delivered all of that, really.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.960
So what does it mean to you to see the place as it is today?

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.600
I'm proud. I'm proud that when you speak to people and people say,

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.080
did you work on that reservoir? And I was like, yeah, I've been there. It's amazing. It's lovely.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:04.280
The staff are great. It makes you feel like you've been a small part of a really big piece of history.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:12.840
I think at the time, it felt a little bit like, oh my God, are we ever going to achieve this,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:21.240
especially with COVID and the amount of work that needed to be done and how eager the community was

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.680
to get on site. And actually, the expectations of the community as well. It's a really important

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:32.680
site for people. I first knew about the site when probably when they drained the reservoir

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:38.600
and around that time, the campaign time, my husband and my in-laws live around the area. My

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:45.080
father-in-law has got an allotment next door. And I remember the expletives coming out of my husband's

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:52.280
mouse when the reservoir was drained, driving around the area, and I remember the people who

00:11:52.280 --> 00:12:01.880
worked around the area. I knew about the site, but I grew up in Penaath, so it wasn't something that

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:10.120
formed part of my childhood or growing up in Cardiff. I've had people who have worked around

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:16.920
the area, worked at Cardiff Met on Kingcoy campus and came to me, so where are these reservoirs?

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:23.720
Where are they? And I say, you've probably driven past them most days of your working life. You

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:30.200
just don't see them. But I remember the first time coming onto the site, and it's so hidden,

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.160
it doesn't feel like you're in the middle of Cardiff. And I had that site to myself, which was

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:41.720
amazing. But it's really nice now that that's being able to be shared by lots of other people.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:49.960
And hopefully, even though my kids roll their eyes and get bored of it, that maybe one day

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.000
when they're older, they'll be able to bring their kids here and say,

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.120
your grandmother did a bit of this. So yeah, be nice. It's nice.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:58.700
Yes.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.360
Ami, thank you very much for sharing your stories with us.
