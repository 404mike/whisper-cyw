My first friend was a girl called Becky Hogue. I've known her since play school.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.920
Probably first thing I remember about them is being at play school together.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.120
The slides and games and things. I knew them in school up till year seven.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.640
We're good friends because our parents knew each other.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.120
Our parents are still good friends with each other and we're still in touch.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.160
Because of the distance, because I'm around 250-300 miles from where Becky lives,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.000
we quite often communicate on social media, Facebook, sometimes I haven't found all Twitter

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.720
but mostly Facebook. I've lived in Somerset for the first two and a half years of my life

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.520
and the rest of the time I've lived in Dorset and more recently North Wales.
