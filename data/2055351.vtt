You've shagged

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
You've shagged

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200
We've shagged

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.400
You've shagged

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.300
You've shagged

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.600
We've shagged

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.000
Hello

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.700
We are

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.020
The land in no junction you've shed

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.580
And we've been working on the famous story of Beth Gellert

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.500
We've even written our own play about it

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.100
However, not many people know the real facts behind a legend

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.860
So, if you listen to the play first

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.420
Then afterwards we'll tell you the shocking truth

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.700
The story of Beth Gellert

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.700
One day, hundreds of years ago, in the 13th century

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.980
Prince Ruelin and Prince F. Joan are staying at the Summer Palace

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.180
In the pretty village of Beth Gellert

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
When they decide to go hunting

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.180
Let's go hunting Joan, look it's a gorgeous day

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.700
But what about the baby?

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
Joan, what do we have servants for?

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.700
We can leave Griff with one of them

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700
Marie

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.700
Yes, my lady

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.700
The prince and I are going out hunting

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.700
Will you look after Prince Griffith for us please?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.700
He's in his cot, see, fast asleep

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.700
Yes, of course, my lady

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.700
The baby will be quite safe than me

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.700
We'll probably be out most of the afternoon

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.700
But we won't be too late

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.700
I'll call the dogs

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.700
Gellert, Taron, Maddox, Bryn, Conwy

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.700
Gellert, Gellert

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.700
Gellert was their favourite hunting dog

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.700
Um, where's Gellert?

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.700
Oh, he'll be around somewhere

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.700
He'll catch up

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.700
He's faster than all our other dogs put together

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.700
Is dear old Gellert

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.700
Come on, let's go and saddle up

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.700
We're wasting time

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.700
Servant Marie watches the hunting party gallop off in the sunshine

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.700
As the prince and princess ride away

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.700
I think to myself

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.700
They expect me to stay inside when it's perfectly good weather out there

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.700
The baby's in his cot, I'm fast asleep

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.700
No harm can come to him

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.700
I go downstairs and cross the great hall towards the door

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.700
And shout to the other servants

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.700
I'm going out for a walk

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.700
Then I open the door

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.700
And go out laughing to myself

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.700
He he he he

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.700
I'll be back before then

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.700
And they'll never know

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.700
But when she goes out

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.700
The servant doesn't shut the door properly

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.700
And along comes a huge sea wolf

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.700
There are still wolves in Wales in the 13th century

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.700
Well, someone's been careless

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.700
The palace door is open and cracked

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.700
And I'm hungry

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.460
I'll just nudge the door so that it's a little bit more open.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.860
I wonder what I'll find inside.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.860
A moment later, Gellert, the prince and princess's favourite dog,

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.660
who's also seen his master and mistress setting off on their hunt,

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:47.820
is just about to run and join them when passing through the royal bedchambers,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.220
he notices something.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.420
Ruff, ruff!

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.020
Wait, hang on, the baby's on his own.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.300
They never leave the baby on his own.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.700
They always make sure he's with someone.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.300
Where's the servant?

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.700
I'd better go have a close look and make sure he's all right.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.020
Ruff, ruff!

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.860
I'm lying in my car having a nice nap

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.020
and when I wake up I see Gellert standing next to me.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.820
I love Gellert.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.220
He's my mummy and daddy's favourite hunting hound, all soft and velvety.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.820
So I say, hello, Gellert.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.020
Dogs can't understand baby language,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.420
but I think Gellert gets the general idea because he says back.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.420
Ruff, ruff!

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.220
Hello, baby.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.380
Babies can't understand dog language either,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.620
but I think Griff also must get the general idea because then he says,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.380
I love you, Gellert.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.580
Ruff, ruff!

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.740
Just a minute.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.180
What's that at the bedchamber door?

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.780
That doesn't smell familiar.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.540
Ah, it's a wolf.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.180
I'm a bit scared.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.420
Alone with a baby facing a wolf.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.740
Maybe we could just run and hide,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.140
but where would we hide?

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.140
Or maybe we could just run really fast,

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.460
but no, I'm being silly.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.540
A baby can't run,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.140
and even if we could, a wolf can run really fast too.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.140
Hmm.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:29.140
I spy with my little eye a nice, succulent, juicy baby.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.900
Ruff!

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.260
And a dog.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.700
Ruff!

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.300
And a dog.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.220
But not really a very big one.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.220
Oh no!

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:46.020
I can see a big, sharp, dark wolf coming slowly towards me.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.020
Ruff!

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.620
I have to protect the baby.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.220
It's going to bite me!

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.900
Gellert!

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.620
Ruff!

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.220
This wolf's really too big for me.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.420
I don't know what to do.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.620
Well, there's not a lot I can do.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.020
I'm a baby, so I start to cry.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.020
Ruff!

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.020
Ruff!

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.020
Gellert!

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.020
Gellert!

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.020
After everything the prince and princess have done for me,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.620
I have to save him.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.020
I have to fight.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.620
That's what the prince and princess want me to do.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.620
Help! Help!

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.620
Gellert!

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.020
He's part of my family, and that's what families do.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.620
They look out for each other.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.620
Help me, Gellert!

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.020
So, I need to kill it.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.020
Ruff!

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.020
You can try.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.020
Help!

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.020
Don't worry, Griff.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.020
Everything's going to be all right.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:45.020
I'm just nudging you out of the crib so you can roll underneath it for safety.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.020
Then I'll take it on.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.020
There.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.020
Come on then, dog.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.020
Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.020
Do your worst.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:59.020
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.020
I bite and scratch at the wolf.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.020
Ruff!

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.020
And I bite and scratch back.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:14.020
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:19.020
After a huge fight, I see our brave dog, Gellert,

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.020
by the big, dark, sharp wolf.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.020
Over and over, five, maybe ten times,

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.020
the wolf crawls beneath

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.020
the great tapestry curtains.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.020
I'm done for.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.020
And dies.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.020
And I am safe!

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.020
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.020
I did it.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.020
Now, I can't lift the baby back into the cot,

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.020
so I'll just wait beside him

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.020
till my master and mistress get home,

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.020
just for safety.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.020
Thank you, Gellert. I love you.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.020
Meanwhile, all Prince Harannan and Princess Joan

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.020
have enjoyed their hunting.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.020
But in spite of this, they come home early.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.020
To be honest, they're very about to go out.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.020
It's rather odd he didn't join us, isn't it?

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.020
Where's he got to?

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.020
I suppose he'll show up later.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.020
There's a horrible smell in the castle, isn't there?

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.020
Let's go up and check on Griff.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.020
They raced up the stairs.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.020
Ruff!

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.020
I'm so happy that the Prince and Princess are back.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.020
I can hear them cunning.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.020
But in the bedchamber,

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.020
a terrible sight meets their eyes.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.020
The cot is empty.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.020
Where's our baby?

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.020
Gellert!

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.020
Where's the baby?

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.020
Why is there blood around Gellert's nose?

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.020
Where's the baby, Gellert?

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.020
Why is there fur all over the crib?

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.020
And why does it smell like death?

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.020
Gellert!

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.020
Gellert!

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.020
Have you killed our baby?

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.020
Ruff!

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.020
I tried to tell the Prince and Princess what's happened,

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.020
but they're human, so they can't understand dog language.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.020
Suddenly, my dad...

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.020
...sticks a knife.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.020
It's a Gellert!

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.020
Poor Gellert, when he's so bleed...

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.020
...and dies.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.020
And the minute he dies...

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.020
Look, Hugh, under the crib.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.020
It's our baby!

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.020
But I don't understand.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.020
Why was there blood all over Gellert's?

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.020
There, look, there beneath the curtains.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.020
A wolf, a huge she-wolf, dead.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.020
So Gellert didn't kill our baby.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.020
He was trying to protect it from the wolf.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.020
Oh, no, what have I done?

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.020
Yes, you monster, what have you done?

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.020
You've killed the family dog!

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.020
Gellert, I am so sorry.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.020
What a tragedy.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:20.020
Meanwhile, the royal servant has been enjoying her walk.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.020
Oh, I've had such a lovely walk by the river,

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.020
but at last it's time to go home.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.020
As soon as I walk through the door,

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.020
I get this horrible stench of blood.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.020
I almost vomit.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.020
I go upstairs towards the baby's room.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.020
The stench gets worse.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.020
I walk through the door of the bedchamber

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.020
and look towards the floor.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.020
The Prince is on his knees,

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.020
his eyes full of tears.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.020
The Princess in tears too, holding the baby.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.020
I see Gellert on the floor.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.020
Dead and covered in blood.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.020
And a huge wolf in the corner.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.020
Also dead and covered in blood.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.020
I realise what's happened, and that it is all my fault.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.020
I too drop to my knees, a tear falls down my cheek.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.020
This, this is all your fault.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.020
I sentence you to death.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.020
In the end, the Prince and Princess

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.020
don't put the servant to death.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.020
But she is sucked,

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.020
and she never leaves any baby in her care,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.020
alone, ever again.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.020
And the agonised Prince digs the grave

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.020
for their faithful dog

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.020
by the river where the maid servant had walked

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.020
with the tombstone telling of his faithfulness and bravery.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:40.020
Thousands of tourists visit this grave or berth,

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.020
as we say in Welsh, every year.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.020
Berth, Gellert.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.020
And is it not the saddest story you ever heard?

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.020
Now put away your tissues,

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:55.020
because we are going to tell you the truth behind this story.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.020
The true story behind this story is another story.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:04.020
Over 200 years ago, in 1802,

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:09.020
a man called David Pritchard was living in South Wales.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.020
One day, he and his wife decided to move to North Wales.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.020
We don't know the name of David's wife.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.020
But we've decided to call her...

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.020
Sylwain.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.020
We also don't know why they moved,

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.020
but we've made a few guesses.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.020
David, we're moving.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.020
What? Moving? But you know my dad lives here.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.020
Yes, that's why I want to move.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.020
Hmm, here's another guess.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.020
David dear, I've got something to tell you.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.020
I want us to move.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.020
What? Why would we do that?

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.020
Because I'm absolutely sick of it here.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.020
I don't know. It sounds like a lot of bother.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.020
We've got our whole life here.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.020
How would we even move all our things?

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.020
Oh, stop whining. You're always so miserable.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.020
I'm ready for something new.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.020
The scenery upstairs is beautiful.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.020
Just think how lovely it would be to wake up

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.020
and see the sunrise on the mountains.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.020
Well, that does sound nice.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:15.020
Also, there's a hotel for sale for just £450.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.020
What a bargain!

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.020
Let's do it.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:23.020
So we're only guessing why the Pritchards moved,

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.020
but it is true they did buy a hotel,

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.020
though we've guessed how much it cost.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.020
The hotel was, yes, you've guessed it,

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.020
in a pretty little village called Berthgallet,

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.020
named after an eighth-century saint

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.020
who settled here called Kellett.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.020
Nothing to do with dogs.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.020
And the hotel was called the Berthgallet Hotel.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:53.020
It seems the hotel didn't do very well at first

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.020
for the Pritchards.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.020
Listen David, we've been here all week and we're broke.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.020
Yes, I know.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.020
Tell me, have you ever heard of the folk tale

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.020
about the master and the faithful hound?

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.020
It's a very common tale all over Europe and Asia.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.020
No, and I don't want to hear about it

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.020
unless it helps our business.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:23.020
All you ever talk, David, is nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.020
But it will help our business, my dear.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.020
Let me whisper my plan into your ear.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.020
You see, it's perfect, just perfect.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.020
Yes, I suppose I do see some potential for a once.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.020
Later that night.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.020
Are you sure this is a good idea?

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.020
Yes, of course. Don't be silly.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.020
It's a brilliant idea.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.020
I'm not too sure.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.020
No, I know we have no money

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.020
and we need money to pay the bills.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.020
But what if someone finds out the truth?

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.020
Don't be stupid, no one will ever know.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.020
Now you do it for a bit.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:11.020
My hands are tired and my clothes are getting really dirty.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.020
Right, get the box ready to put in the hole.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.020
There, now the gravestone's in place too.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.020
Teehee, it looks so real.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.020
Yes, David Pritchard attached the story

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:30.020
of the faithful hound to a real Welsh prince called Chwelyn.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.020
And pretended the whole thing had happened in Bethgallant.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:39.020
And even dug a false grave for the imaginary dog

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:43.020
and erected a false gravestone telling his story.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:47.020
The whole thing was a scam and it worked.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:52.020
Thousands of tourists come every year to cry of the dog's grave.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:57.020
And they do say that whenever money is exchanged

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:03.020
in the Bethgallant Hotel, now called the Royal Goat Hotel...

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.020
I'd like a room with a view please.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.020
Follow me, that would be £1000.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.020
You can hear the ghosts of the Pritchards laughing.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.020
That's it.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.020
We hope you've enjoyed our two plays in one by...
