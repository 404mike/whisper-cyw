So I see lots of bonnie lasses in my color white, but my head dissent of new and bonnie Kate McBride.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I know, I know a chap that wore one away, still I'm surprised myself sometimes, that's all I've got to say.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Roman, Roman, the bonnie lances fly. Roman is my Roman, with my lucky by the side.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:43.000
When the sun is gone to rest, what's time that I'll rest? For it was Roman in the morning.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000
One night in the grove when we were took on side by side, I kissed her twice and asked her once if she would be my bride.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:04.000
She was shy and so was I, said we would bathe the same, but I got braver and braver on the journey come unhanged.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Roman, Roman, the bonnie lances fly. Roman is my Roman, with my lucky by the side.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:27.000
When the sun is gone to rest, what's time that I'll rest? For it was Roman in the morning.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Last night after school when we got home at half past nine, I'm sitting by the kitchen while I ask her to be mine.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:49.000
When she promised I'd look up and dance the heaven fling, I've just been tailed you're house and I've walked on my sweet ring.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Roman, Roman, the bonnie lances fly. Roman is my Roman, with my lucky by the side.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When the sun is gone to rest, what's time that I'll rest? For it was Roman in the morning.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Roman, Roman, the bonnie lances fly. Roman is my Roman, with my lucky by the side.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:35.000

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Why can't I at school be a Roman in the morning?
