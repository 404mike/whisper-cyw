00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
My goodness me, that's my father-in-law and my mother-in-law.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And here they've got chickens and look here, we used to put old sacks and something on the railing to dry after we'd washed them, you know, door mats sort of thing, you know.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So they've got a lot of white chickens there.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Yes, this is all gone now and it's a window, they built it up and it's a window and that's a dining area now at Ashfield.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Since I've come. Lots of changes.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Yes, that's right.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Oh, and these are the Robinsons at Ashfield. Oh, good Lord, yes, that seat is at Ashfield now.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Yes, and that's my husband.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
How old is he there?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Well, about three, I think. The Robinsons came to Ashfield during the war from near London and they were paying guests, you see.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And when the evacuees were coming, like these didn't come straight away, but you know, Arthur's parents knew they were coming.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And well, why can't you have evacuees or something, you see, but they knew these were coming, but because there were several bedrooms at Ashfield.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And Annie Poffrey was a sister to the previous owner of Ashfield. She came from the Dufferin in Llanorthal.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So Ashfield, well 1926, well yes, well Arthur would only be 24 then he was born in 1924.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So two years there.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Yes, that's right, yes. There used to be two seats like that at Ashfield, but when I went there there was only one, but that one was still there.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You know, strange shape. They've got interesting shapes at the back to read on.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Indeed.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Oh, this is something that, this is from Bertie Davis. Yes, that's right, yes.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Oh, it's about the Lewin Farm. Oh, that's the prices of the Lewin Farm.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Oh yes, they were doing photography, I suppose, by the look of it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Well no, well they haven't got any, well it surely was, but they haven't got any rosettes, so they didn't have those.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
She's got a posh hat on.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
That says it all.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Yes, that's right, yes. Oh, they're at the War Memorial there, yes, that's right, yes.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Oh, that's right, that's gone down memory lane a bit.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
You certainly have, Doreen, yes, my word you have.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Yes, that's right.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
That's great, thanks ever so much.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Yes, that's right, yes. Well I'll just have a quick look, because I'm picking Doreen Hope up next to you.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
My love.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
You want to go to the luncheon club?
