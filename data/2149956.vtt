WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Yeah, I can do if you want.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay, so today is April the 5th, 2023.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Yes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And this is part of StatPoll's oral history project.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Joining me today, so I'm Julian Rollins, the tutor at StatPoll.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I've got a couple of students here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So Richard is joining me, Richard Burns joining me with the questions.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And our interviewee for today is Hannah.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Hi.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Hannah Marshall.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Yeah.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Yeah.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Who lives in StatPoll and also comes here and works with us here at StatPoll Allgarden.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So I think my first question for you Hannah is how long have you lived in StatPoll?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
All my life.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Yeah.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Yeah, literally all my life.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So you were born here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Yeah, I was born here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yeah, I was born in Stackpole.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So what's your earliest memory of StatPoll Allgarden then?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
My earliest memory?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It must be about seven years ago where me and my mum and my stepdad would come down

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
here for a cup of coffee and tea and just have a walk around the all gardens and then

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the woods.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So we're a bit away from the village here, aren't we?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
How long does it take you to walk into the village?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
To walk from here to the village it will take me about 30 minutes.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Yeah.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So it's about three mile.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Is it?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Yeah, so we're quite separated from the village but it's kind of somewhere that you could

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
come and, you've got a dog, haven't you?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Walk the dog.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
He can't do any more runs like that, I used to.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So when you used to come here then, you'd come and walk around, you'd go to the cafe

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and stuff.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Yeah.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
How come you then ended up coming here to help with the gardening then?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I guess it's always something I've always been interested in, gardening.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But like I'd just finished college and I didn't know what to do and mum said why don't you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
go down the wall gardens for a bit and have a do it there.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So it's your mum's idea.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Yeah.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So volunteering then and doing a bit of college work as well.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Yeah.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So how old were you then?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I must have been 16, 18, around that.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Okay.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Yeah.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So how old are you now?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
24.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So a few years.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Yeah.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And has much changed then during the time you've been here?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Oh, a lot has changed.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
A lot.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I mean all the plots used to be with a fish pond whiz and then yeah, everything's just

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
changed.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So you're growing, you're doing gardening as part of the team that look after the whole

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
place.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Yeah.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And then you're also growing stuff on individual plots.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Yeah.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
What do you grow on your plots?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I've got spinach in, I've got lavender, I've got two roses and then sometimes I grow carrots,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
leeks, onions and maybe beetroot this year.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Lots of different things.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Yeah.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So when you first came here then Hannah, what were your kind of, what was your level of

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
gardening knowledge, gardening understanding then?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Had you done a bit before?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Yeah, I did.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I potted around in the garden at home and I had quite a big understanding of what gardening

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
was and what to do.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
But yeah, it's grown since then.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You've learned more.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Yeah.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
What do you think you get from gardening then?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Just exercise, new knowledge again and just new knowledge really.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And just meeting new people and friends, making friends.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So there's quite a, yeah, it's quite a sociable thing here, isn't it?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Yeah.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Yeah.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Richard, she wants a few questions.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Right, I've got a question for you, Hannah.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Yeah.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I suppose the question is, what is your favourite part about Datspo Gardens altogether?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I think it's just being out and making friends and just having a social and obviously the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
gardening as well.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I really enjoy that.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Sounds really good.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Okay, do you have a particular favourite time of year at all?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I think my favourite time of year is autumn because it's not too hot and it's not too

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
cold.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I hate the heat.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Yeah, I actually agree with that statement.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Is there a favourite job like doing in the gardens?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I quite like pruning.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Pruning the fruit bushes and anything physical.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I love doing like digging.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I'll do anything that needs heavy needs moving, I'll do it.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Fair enough.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Well, say for example, well like today obviously it's raining isn't it?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Yeah.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So do you have a particular favourite job that you like to do inside?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I quite like sanding or potting on.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I really enjoy them too.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So you mentioned sanding for the benefit of the recording then.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
There's a bit of woodwork goes on on rainy days in one of the polytunnels isn't there?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
What are you making?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Bird boxes and bird feeders I think are the main ones and bug boxes.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So it's all gardening related stuff and then it's sold in the shop isn't it?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Yeah.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So you mentioned that it's a sociable thing that you've got a group of people that you work with,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
which is nice isn't it?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It's quite a tight-knit group.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Yeah.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You've also got visitors coming in through the summer, get more of them during the summer.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
How do you feel about that?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Do you have much interaction?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Sometimes they'll come up and ask about the yacchiums, the really tall dinosaur plants as I call them.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I sometimes talk to them if they're asking what I'm up to and how am I coping with the heat and everything.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So it gives them a bit of an extra, more information about the place doesn't it?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Yeah.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And sometimes I'll get asked directions as well.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It's like where's the lily pond?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
About an hour maybe, a couple of minute walk.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Or the other one is where's the big country house?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Oh, yeah that's the main one.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So what about your neighbours and stuff then? Is this somewhere that they use much?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I think they do. During the summer I do see some of them come down here in the summer and have a walk around.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So somewhere just for a bit of a walk?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Yeah.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Little kids, dogs, that sort of thing?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Yeah, mainly dogs.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And of course we've got the woods just over there as well so it's quite a good place to park.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I think the fact that we don't charge for parking helps as well.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Yeah, it does help.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So Richard asked you about the favourite job.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I was thinking, can you sort of talk us through like a normal day?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
What time you get here? What do you do first?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I get here about 10 maybe, depending if we're running a bit late or whatever.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And then we'll have a little morning break and then if it's nice out we'll go outside,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000
either do some hoeing, some weeding on our veg pots in the summer or even watering or whatever we need to do.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And if it's raining we'll either go in the top polytunnel and do some woodworking there,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:13.000
like making bug boxes and sanding and painting or we'll go in the greenhouse and put on some plants.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It's nice in those polytunnels on a rainy day in the winter.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Yeah.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Yeah, it almost feels like the summer.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So we did ask you about what benefits you think you get from it.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So it's about being outside and getting fresh air and exercise.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Yeah.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But it's also about being part of a sort of a team, isn't it?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Yeah.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Do you prefer, so people are very much given the chance to sort of choose their way of working,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000
do you prefer to be like part of a little team doing weeding or would you rather be off doing something on your own and then come together?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
It depends what the job is. If it's something that I can do on my own, I'll do it on my own.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
But if I like, if I want to do a team job, I'll go on a team job and do it with people.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Just depends.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And the veg you grow then, we've spoken about this in the college work recently, haven't we?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Yeah.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So I'm going to ask you the same question again. What of the stuff that you grow then, what do you do with it?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I will take it home and mum will either cook it or make some like food out of, make a meal out of it or whatnot.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Is that important to you, the fact that there's like a product from the gardening or would you be happy just to do like flowers and stuff?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I don't mind doing both. I like, I quite like the both side. I like my flowers more as well as the veg.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Yeah. So if we did away, you know, if they did away with the veg growing altogether and just said the job is to keep the place looking good, you'd be happy?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I'd be quite happy, yeah.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Which is, I mean, as you go around, you mentioned the ecuums.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Yeah.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
As you go around, which is the bit, is there a corner that you particularly like?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Over in, I do like the sensory garden because in the summer it's really shaded.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Is that over by the crockery?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Yeah. And up past the gravel circle, it's really shaded by there so it's nice and quite cool.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Have you got any other questions? You've covered quite a lot of country, haven't you?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I can't think about any.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I was tempted to ask, although it's a bit like it because it's my little part of the world, to ask about the college work.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So you do, all the time you've been here, you've been doing some sort of college courses.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
How do you find that?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I quite enjoy them actually. It's just like learning something new.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Like I think the other last year, I think we made clay pots and I've never ever worked with clay before.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
So it's just little bits like that I like learning about.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
It adds a bit of variety to the day, doesn't it?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Yeah. It breaks it up a bit.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Great. Is there anything else you think that we haven't asked you about?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I don't think so.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
You want to tell posterity, you want to tell people in the future, straight forward a hundred years.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Oh God, I can't literally think of anything.
