00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.160
It feels like all of my life I have been all run and scared

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:36.240
Now here I stand all alone all at home with myself

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:56.840
I was living in confusion created an illusion now I'm leaving my past behind

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:25.640
The best things in life are free and that's the way I'm gonna be

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:38.720
Like a bluebird on a wing this time I'm gonna swim

00:01:38.720 --> 00:02:00.480
And there'll be no more crying no more crying for you no no

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:13.000
And there'll be no more singing those lost and lonely blues for you no
