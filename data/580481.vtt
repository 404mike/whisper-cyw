00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
The beds, as I say, were not very comfortable, I would imagine.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.440
I don't know whether they were actually straw filled, probably horsehair filled,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.800
but as I say, not very comfortable.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.440
The sheets and bed linen were a delicate shade of grey.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.680
Why on earth this was? Every other hospital I've worked in, the sheets were spotlessly white,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.920
but in Hensel, something to do with the laundry, I don't know, but I was appalled

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.120
at these horrible grey sheets that we have to use.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.040
The bed linen, of course, were no duvets in those days, it had to be blankets.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.440
And these, again, were washed as frequently as they required, is the only way I can put it.
