00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.300
It's Friday the 17th of May 2019 and I'm here with Jill Willey in her house in Raider.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:16.200
Jill, as you know, on the 20th of July 1969 we had the first landing on the moon.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.700
How old were you when that happened?

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.600
I would have been in my late teens.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.300
I would have been 18.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
Do you remember anything about it?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.300
Oh certainly, yes. I remember all the excitement building up to it.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.600
I think people were almost in a state of disbelief.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.600
Is it going to happen? How can it possibly happen?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.600
How can mankind possibly get all the way up there?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.100
The little stick figures that we saw jumping around in the films, which of course we've seen forever more,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.100
they were almost beyond belief really. They looked a little bit like cartoon characters.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.400
Yes, as they said, one giant step for mankind, wasn't it?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.400
Where were you when you were watching it?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.400
Oh, where would I have been? I don't know if I saw the actual landing.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.900
I'm not sure if that bit was televised. I suppose it must have been.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.400
But of course we saw it for at least several weeks afterwards.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
We're living in Lincolnshire.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.400
Some people heard it on the radio.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.700
Yes, I think most people had a TV in those days.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.700
I know we'd certainly had a TV for well over 10 years by then.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.700
One thing I remember thinking, people talk about Neil Armstrong,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.700
Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.700
That would have been wonderful, but the way I looked at it was,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.700
we were all on the earth, they were all up there.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.700
But Buzz Aldrin, who came second,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
how wonderful to be the first man to be in close proximity

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and to presumably watch Neil Armstrong actually set foot on the moon.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I think Buzz had the better deal actually. I really do.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We always talk about getting there first.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm not sure where Buzz was when he got onto the moon,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but at least he was the closest person to the first man on the moon.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.300
I mean, how wonderful that would be.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.300
Also what I do remember was people's attitudes towards it.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.300
I mean, the Americans were all patting themselves on the back,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.300
basically, because I think they'd won the space race.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.300
I remember seeing an interview sometime before when Yuri Gagarin,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.300
if you remember, was the first astronaut actually in outer space

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.300
and how disappointed these guys on the radio were

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.600
because Russia had got there first.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.600
But of course they went that step further and made it to the moon.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.600
I suppose the Cold War would have been at its peak then really,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.600
so it was very much an enmity.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.600
But I remember them being so pleased that they got there first.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.600
And I think really the Western world was happier about that too,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.600
because there was always that sort of slight,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.600
oh dear Russia, you know, that slight,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.900
not being very comfortable with Russia and what Russia was doing.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.900
And then in hindsight, I remember how people's views changed.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.900
I mean, mankind had stepped on the moon

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.900
and nothing could ever, ever be the same again.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.900
I mean, the myths that we'd comfortably lift with,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.900
ad infinitum really, about darker the moon and the spirits

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900
and this lovely mystery about it,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.200
and a little man called Akin Drum up there,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200
you know, banging his ladle.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.200
All that was suddenly dispelled.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200
All that was suddenly shattered by the fact

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.200
that a human being had sort of gone through that barrier

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.200
and actually walked on the moon.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.200
And I think people started questioning their beliefs,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.200
their religious belief.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.200
And I think that also coincided with

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.200
perhaps a drop-off in church attendances

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.200
and that sort of thing.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.500
And people were just querying the sort of things

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.500
that they'd held precious to them for, you know,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.500
for so long, really.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.500
Yes, it was amazing.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500
Yes, certainly, yeah.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.500
And of course they're still up there

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.500
doing all sorts of strange things, aren't they?

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.500
Well, good luck to them,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.500
as long as we learn something from it.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.500
Brilliant.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500
Thank you very much for that, Jill.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.500
That's very, very good.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.500
You're welcome.
