00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.320
The location of the interview is the Swicker office.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.000
Today's date is the 13th of October 2015 and with me I have Sarah and Ren.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.840
Ren would you be kind enough to go first and spell your name in full for the record?

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.280
I'm Ren Hubbock-Mellie, so that's R-E-N-N-N-N-H-U-B-B-U-C-K-M-E-L-L-Y.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.760
Lovely. Sarah would you do the same please?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.560
I'm Sarah Annoil, which is spelled S-A-R-A-A-N-N-W-Y-L.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.080
Lovely and we're off. So the carnival just gone, Cardiff Carnival 2015.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.440
How and in what way did you lovely people take part?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:01.080
Well, we were participating in glorious fashion by puppeteering a giant blue bald naked fertility goddess

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.200
down through the streets of Cardiff, which is an awesome experience.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.040
A really hard physical work and just really, really sort of celebratory and fun as well as quite adversarial at times.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.000
Of course, the vision and the author of the work was Nicky Fogarty.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.520
What were her influences when she made this piece?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.120
I remember she said some photographs with me way before she ever bent a willow cane and covered it with anything.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.840
I think the whole idea grew and grew and grew until it became enormous and became much bigger than she expected.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.120
That's true.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.440
She was looking into pre-Columbian fertility goddess ideas basically around feminine empowerment and feminine sexuality.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.520
But accessing a whole load of sort of contemporary and sort of 70s feminist ideas about the female radical sort of sexual power.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.360
I remember her showing me a picture of a sort of a pre-Columbian fertility goddess and we both agreed that,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.200
yeah, she's all bum, belly and bust. That's what she's going to be.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.560
Nicky was saying that.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.920
So Nicky's inside this backpack and she's in a sense coming down.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.400
She's an extension of the spine of this giant blue woman who's got to be at least three meters high, if not higher.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.360
And I'm right in thinking that she's in a, we can name it, why not, we're advertising a Tesco trolley too.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.640
And that she has two hands which can be operated as well and they're on bamboo sticks.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.280
And this is where you both come in. Is that right?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.840
Yeah.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.680
Yes. So what was it like operating that?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.360
What was it? Because it seems to be quite a powerful statement to be parading a giant,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.960
naked blue woman through the streets of Cardiff in 2015.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.200
Exactly the kind of statement I personally approve of.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.480
How did the audience react or not, as the case may be?

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.720
Well, there was lots of different kind of reactions.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.560
The older women were cheering as soon as they saw it.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.000
Yeah, because there's also not just that this beautiful blue woman,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.240
there's also these quotes that she put on, such as we are people, not things.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.680
She took, I think, from the internet or other places.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.760
So they were all over.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.400
And I think people are also quite confused by what it was.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.160
They weren't entirely sure how to take it.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.720
So the men, a lot of them were just sort of quite quiet and didn't really know how to react.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.480
It was quite interesting that because it wasn't sexy, but it was naked.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.840
She had a big belly, big boobs, big bums.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.080
People were initially like, my god's big naked lady.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.360
And then they were like, well, there's something more being said here.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.920
So that was just, there was not confusion, but an interesting sort of it was the biggest impact,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.520
I think, of that particular carnival.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.160
The biggest.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.320
Yes, it was the biggest single visual statement.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.960
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.560
You know, really strong, really big.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.600
Yes.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.000
Yes.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.400
And she had half the sky written on the back as well, which is Chinese phrase,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.320
which is basically women are half the sky.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.820
Excellent.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.000
And so she had the sky and the sky theme going through it,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.480
which is why the sculpture was blue and had stars.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.560
Desert and everything at the bottom.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.480
Yeah, that was a thing of great beauty.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.680
And there will be pictures of this in the Victoria archive that we put up as well.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.240
And that's a mistake in your saying that there was one male scallywag who,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.040
in fact, took it upon themselves to express their artistic critical opinion of.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.680
Yeah, I was I was operating one of the hands.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.200
So while Sarah was with the other arm and Nicky was sort of pulling pushing the trolley,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.280
this man sort of stepped out pretty much in front of me and he just looked at it.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.280
And he initially was sort of quite happy to see it, I think,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.640
because it was like a sexy lady.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.600
But then he read some of the quotes and he basically said, F you.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.800
And he tried to laugh it off almost.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.720
And I was like, I was I was not entirely sure what he said at first.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.800
I realized I was it was too late to be like, why did you say that?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.560
And what really offended you about this?

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.680
It was interesting because the whole thing wasn't negative.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.560
It's hugely positive.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.080
So basically it was just celebration.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.640
It was saying nothing negative about men, nothing negative about women,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.240
just a celebration of female sexuality.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.040
That's it really.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.040
But basically, because it made it really clear to me as somebody

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.800
who basically just assumes that we're all feminists these days,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.160
that that isn't the scenario.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.880
I don't know where you go down the street and you see like men hanging out of windows,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.680
cat calling it.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.180
Yeah.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.680
And you're like, because of the buzz.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.480
Because there's a boo.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.680
It's kind of sad.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.040
But also, yeah, a lot of younger women, one young lady came up to me and said,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.480
can I just ask what this is about?

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.320
So she was probably about 18 or 19.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.320
And I said, well, it's about us being people, not things.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.720
And she said, oh, that's what we thought it was about.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.220
Yay.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.080
Yeah, it was positive.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.880
Very positive.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.080
I think it was.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.080
And of course, you did mention what should we call the tumbleweed factor,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.280
that not only did you have the biggest structure with the three of you

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.800
weeding it, the length and breadth of Cardiff City Centre,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.000
but then you have the last stretch on the way home.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.720
How were you affected by the wind and the rest of it?

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.240
Because it was a big structure.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.680
Basically, I pulled my back out.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.040
Will your lawyers be in touch?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.680
They will, yes.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.080
Because it was hugely heavy.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.280
Really physical.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.640
But that was part of it, really, because you put loads of work into making

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.480
the sculpture move and dance and stuff.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.760
We had this really strong wind, especially on Churchill Way.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.120
And we were almost toppled over in this.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.480
It felt almost like both of you had a physical fight as well,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.040
because you had to push this big object.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.800
And it was hard.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.240
It wasn't easy.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.680
And you had to just keep on going.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.560
So it was like this endurance test as well.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.120
And it sort of mirrored the struggle of women.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.280
No, no, there's a synergy about the whole.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.920
Absolutely.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.360
I could see it all in my head.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.400
It was great because we were dressed in blue and we had sky face paint on.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.240
So it was like we were part of the sculpture.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.720
And then to puppety of the arms, we have the dance.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.280
So it's like this thing that we were all part of.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.080
It was really great.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.480
A gestalt being more than the sum of your parts.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.040
Yes.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.560
Yes, that's how I felt about it.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.840
Of course, the Cardiff Parliament War 2015 parade

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.400
is not the only parading you have done with Swicker.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.240
You are, if not veterans, then you've certainly had a taste

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.760
of more on one occasion of the National St David's Day parade.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.920
How does that feel?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.640
How does that compare?

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.800
What are your experiences there?

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.280
What did you do?

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.160
Were you dragons?

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.240
Yeah, that was quite interesting.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.480
Such sculptures that we had on us were probably one of the biggest.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.760
The costies, yeah.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.560
In the carnival.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.640
And there was a lot of attention on us, especially when we got to the end

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.720
and we were just out in the castle.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.080
So many people wanted photos and that was really odd.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.560
Ren basically had a shamanic experience.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.800
She went into dragon mode and she wasn't Ren anymore.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.560
Jumping around like, I was a fly.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.200
Sometimes the costume came over.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.400
It really did.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.600
That's what it felt like.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.280
I was in an altar state, definitely.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:06.760
Really?

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.320
It's good.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.280
That's funny.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.240
That's fantastic.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.840
She was photobombing my photos.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.480
Yeah, I was like.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.680
Yeah, the thing about that particular parade is that you get to see in such sort of explicit

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.360
and again, celebratory party manner, all the different sort of communities, basically.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.840
So you have people and they're all, you know, the Malaysians of Cardiff or so and so.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.280
It's just so great that everybody's coming together into that thing.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.240
It just doesn't happen.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.480
And it makes you realise how many different communities there are in Cardiff.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.160
Yeah, hidden communities for most of us.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.000
Yes, definitely.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.120
And you're both practicing artists.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.480
I want to again, just for austerity, for we are talking into the future here.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.680
Would you care to say a little bit about yourself as an artist?

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.680
You're yeah, well, you've come and practice a statement from Ren.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.200
What do you think, Ren?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.000
I'm a writer and I also perform as well.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.600
And a lot of the stuff that I perform is quite graphic.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.560
It's quite explicit.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.680
It's about the body.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.720
It's about boundaries and a lot of it's about sex.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.800
So I try to sort of broach to be subjects by basically throwing it in people's face.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.440
And it's comic.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:18.600
Yeah.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.120
And also I host events.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.600
I'm trying to set up a young writers collective called Etch.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:31.160
I'm also trying to set up an open mic for specifically to

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.600
try to encourage people to perform, like to experiment performance as well.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.720
And it's called Duke.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.600
You're not trying to set it up.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.160
You are setting it up.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:39.640
Yeah, I am.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.320
Yeah.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:41.960
And also I'm...

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.840
Listen to your manager.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.720
I'm also in the third year of uni and my dissertation is creative writing

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.040
and is also focused on female sexuality.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.920
So it felt very much synchronous for me to...

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.760
To go through that experience in carnival.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.240
Yeah.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.240
And to realize that this fight isn't over.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.120
That we need to keep talking about this.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.360
Yes.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.320
Yeah.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.280
That's not old hat.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:06.520
No.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.360
Oh, I'm an artist.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.160
I'm a contemporary artist, which means that I do all kinds of stuff,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.520
which are really hard to pigeonhole.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.680
But basically my work as an artist tends to involve engagement with other people,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.640
conversations, work involving video or kind of event based stuff.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.000
I also curate, which means I work with other artists and their practices

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.160
to make events happen so they bring all their artwork in.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.760
I'm writing as well and I'm writing a book at the moment.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.640
The main thing, which really was odd about doing the sculptural thing,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.320
is that I've just started a project for three years called Perfect Me,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.080
which isn't feminist per se, but it absolutely hits all of those things,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.920
those things, those kind of targets,

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.800
because it's about our relationship to our bodies, our physicality.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.320
So I have a big problem, like most women, accepting my body,

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.600
feeling overweight and generally being burdened by the Western objectification of selfhood.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.320
So yeah, it felt very, very, again, synchronous that we were doing it.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.600
But also you're bald.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.640
And also I'm bald.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.720
So not that big of a deal.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.800
I'm a pre-Columbian for tinnitus.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.300
Yeah.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.040
What can I say?

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.800
Sara Red, thank you very much indeed.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.040
I'd like to award you the invisible but yet eternal.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.040
You are both heroes of Cardiff Cardinal.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.680
Thank you very much.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.280
Yay, thank you.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:22.840
That was lovely.
