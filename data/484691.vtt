Steve's Stories

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Steve's Story number three, Cardiff Carnival reaches out

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Cardiff Carnival is always a highlight in the Cardiff cultural calendar

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but its influence has spread and Carnival arts,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
dance and music have helped animate many special events and parades in the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
capital over the years. In March 1991

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Lady Diana stood on the podium on the balcony

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of St David's Hall in the Hayes and waved on Swickr Carnival's contribution

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to the large scale National St David's Day Parade.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This included huge multi-coloured dancing leaf-shaped

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
sails, a Carnival design based on the leaf cutter ant

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
found in Trinidad. These towering costumes

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
were energetically danced in a long line and the impact of their

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
constantly swirling and diving choreography was clear to see on the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
smiling faces of those who lined the route.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I remember that St David's Day Parade in particular because

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as a parade organiser I know that one of the things that must be avoided

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
when finalising any parade line-up is sound clash.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Sound clash occurs when any two marching street bands

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
are placed too close together so their music interferes with

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
each other's playing. The more powerful group drowns out the quieter one

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and it becomes very confusing for the accompanying Carnival dancers

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
as well as the musicians themselves. Now on this particular

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
parade Samba Galez, the Cardiff School of Samba, were performing

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Samba rhythms played to a funky Brazilian swing beat

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but the group were placed too close to a military drumming band

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
whose beat was intended to be the metronome for the steps of the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
accompanying uniformed soldiers. In the ensuing

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
sound clash the funky swing of the Samba beat overcame

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and infected the military drummers to such an extent that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the marching soldiers couldn't help but break step and began

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
bumping into each other. I can still remember the helpless

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
fury on the purple-faced Sergeant Major as the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
domino effect brought on by Samba Galez wreaked havoc on his

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
military formation. Whilst the annual Cardiff Carnival

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is the highlight of Swicker Carnival's calendar, the company has

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
successfully delivered a huge number of projects of

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
varying sizes across Cardiff and indeed across South Wales

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
over the past quarter century. Cardiff Carnival's influence

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
on special events in the city have ranged from lantern and fire spectaculars

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
on City Hall lawn to open-air carnival theatre

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
in the Roald Dahl Place in Cardiff Bay,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Cardiff costumes, music and flair have helped bring the New Year's Eve

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
family festival Kilenig alive and even accompanied the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
progress of the Olympic Torch Relay through the capital.
