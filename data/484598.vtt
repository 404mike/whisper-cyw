00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
Here we go.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.920
Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project, Steve Fletcher, interviewer.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.640
Nigel Watson, interviewee.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.840
The venue, Swicker office.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.480
The date, Sunday the 19th of October 2014.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.360
Nigel, for the record, would you spell your full name, please?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:35.520
Nigel, James, J-A-M-E-S, Watson, W-A-T-S-O-N.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.120
Thanks very much indeed.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.720
Before I founded Swicker, back in 1990, I had the most fabulous and transformative

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.760
cultural experience with a fabulous group called Theatre Taliesin Wales.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.160
Nigel was the founder of that group and artistic co-director.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.200
Please tell us more about Theatre Taliesin Wales, who were they and what did they do?

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:14.240
Right. Well, the first thing to establish is that I founded the company with a dear friend and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.480
colleague who is still a dear friend and colleague, Stuart Cox, who has been living in Mexico for 13

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.400
years. I'm very profoundly pleased to say that we're working on a project together in Cuba at

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.600
the moment. That we had worked together, we'd met and worked together in the 70s in Triple Action

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:45.040
Theatre and then we'd worked together under the first company I formed called Theatre Saga here.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:56.160
And we had wanted to look initially at simply developing a one-man show that we would jointly

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:06.560
script and that I would perform and Stuart would direct. And so initially it was planned to be in

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:15.520
fact a double project in Sri Lanka that we would mount a project about the Welsh shaman and non-conformist

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.800
William Price and that we would do a children's show to go with that. And we wanted to explore

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.840
the very fertile and rich Sri Lankan mask tradition. Neither of us had worked very extensively

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.880
with masks, so there was a technical aspect to this project. We got quite some work done,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.960
we got quite some way towards a residency in the University of Colombo, British Council was supportive

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.760
and then the civil war broke out ferociously once again and the Foreign Office was saying we can't

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.280
offer you any kind of protection. So the project price went on the back burner and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.880
we thought we developed for children and we came across a collection, a retelling of a collection of

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.440
very ancient Indian fables about a character called Dr. Bidpai. The stories were from a collection

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.520
called the Panchatantra which means the five treatises and go back to Buddhist times before

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.760
before Christ. And a good claim can be made for them that these stories have traveled in one form

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.840
or another because they're parables like Aesop involved in the story of the five

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.080
parables like Aesop involving talking animals and so on around the world. So we developed this as a

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.880
children's show and then decided that we added additional material and it became a family show

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:51.040
and then by reorientating material something for adults and toured widely, played in all manner of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.680
places, lots of schools, lots of art centers and village halls, all kinds of venues.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:07.440
Then we had the good fortune to have contact with the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, the Institute of Indian

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:20.320
Culture in West London where most unusually in India classical musicians do not play as accompanists

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.640
for theatre or dance shows. It simply isn't done, it's not part of the protocol.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.440
Other musicians do that work and very fine they are but on this occasion due to our contacts and

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.480
due to the the chemistry being right, a sitar teacher and the tablet teacher both extremely

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:47.280
fine players in their own right agreed to part compose part improvise a score for the performance

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:55.760
and so in a way the apogee of performance was to tour with this and where possible

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.360
a double bill with a short concert an interval and then

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.400
a word in the stargazer's eye was the title that we made.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:16.640
So that had a life in its various forms of something like five years and then after that we

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.920
had a very good positive response. Clearly I'm not ready to do another one man show so

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.480
we started to think about the possibilities of working given our passion for the Indian performing

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:42.480
arts with the variety of Asian communities on our doorstep in Cardiff and the most advanced

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.600
community manifestation of that was Samarja Cultural Centre, a cultural and religious centre

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:58.640
in Grangetown and we spent a year really supporting ourselves by other means

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.440
having at some point decided that we would give to promote a word in the stargazer's eye,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.160
we would promote ourselves and give ourselves a company name and we talked about various options

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:26.000
and I had always been attracted by the shamanic nature of this legendary stroke actual bard with

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.360
poems from the sixth century but legends about whom existing from the middle ages certainly

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.360
perhaps they were much older that that turn constantly on the idea of transformation that's

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.680
what I mean when I say shamanic that that humans turn into animals and vice versa

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.840
and transforming is what performers do to varying degrees all the time in whatever mode they're

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.760
operating so this established first of all the kind of Welsh focus of the company and

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.660
and

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:08.000
as I say led us to spend a year negotiating with the Gujarati community and largely from

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:16.880
Kutch in western Gujarat about making a production with members of the community

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.320
in the Samarja so that took place in the company started in summer 84

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:37.200
and in 1986 we using the Irish and Welsh material at the root of the European Tristan and Ezell myth

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:44.720
Tristan and Ezold as it's most widely known through Wagner we use this material as a as a classic

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.960
eternal triangle between an old king and his young bride and a young lover and other adventures

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.480
with dragons and so on so together with a professional core and

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:08.000
a multilingual production that we rough scripted what there was in English and

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.680
staged together with something like

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:21.280
30 to 40 community participants of all ages and this production created quite a stir I think it

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.840
was the fair to say it's the first of this kind in Wales and we made a BBC radio documentary about

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:36.240
it there was a sort of a significant swell of interest in the ideas behind the premises

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.400
behind the project that we were using Welsh or pan-Celtic narrative material

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.840
of a sufficiently universal character to as a magnet to bring people around with a story that

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.560
they could relate to

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:03.360
and obviously that was the first of a trilogy of Indo-Celtic community plays it was after that

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.200
first play that you came and I think you actually visited me in London where I was working at the

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:17.040
time you explained about the success of Tristan and Ezold the first Indo-Celtic community play

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:26.480
certainly your passion for interculturalism and celebration and the intergenerational nature of

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.160
the vision that you laid before me when I was working in London was so strong that I thought

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:42.080
I better join you in this and I relocated to Cardiff in 1987 and well over to you what happened next

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:51.120
well we were of course very gratified by the warmth of the response to the project and

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:59.360
clearly the ideas that were almost assumed not in terms of simply of being citizens of the world but

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:10.880
of bringing together artistic techniques Welsh clogging and Gujarati folk dance and

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.120
Indian music and Indian music and scales from older Celtic music and Indian scales

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.840
the aesthetic issues were because they were practical ones how shall we do this where shall

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.160
somebody stand what how shall we make this particular kind of music together

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:36.560
were the primary practical questions and problems and challenges that working artists had to face

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.640
but with the kind of looking at the documentary or sorry the

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.640
the film footage and trying to think through some of the resonances that the production

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:56.000
gave rise to we I have to put it that way around that the the practical aesthetic challenges

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.040
were first because those we we couldn't shell but you had to deal with on a day-to-day basis that was

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.680
the nature of the work so then the wider resonances of what the work might represent

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:14.080
came after on reflection and thought well we've done this people seem to think it's a good thing

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:24.640
to do and they enjoyed the show and took its collaborative celebratory spirit to heart

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:36.160
we should go on and do another how do we extend expand develop mutate the idea without simply

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:47.360
repeating ourselves and not boxing ourselves into some kind of creative ghetto so as you say Steve

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.080
as you say Steve with your

00:11:53.040 --> 00:12:00.000
workaholic presence helping to put the company on a on a on a more sensible

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.480
organizational and administrative and financial backing

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.120
we began to think about how we should extend it as I said and and the issue then of of

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.880
of perhaps bringing a company from India to work with a core of

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:26.160
Wales-based performers of whatever ethnicity and the community which wasn't closed it wasn't

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:32.560
or rather it wasn't open only to Gujarati but but the center itself was very open anybody could come

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.200
that was a basic condition that we set down for the collaboration and I don't think there was

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.000
any real difficulty with that there was certainly a long process of quite understandably because

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.360
this was a first and because I believe I'm right in saying that the city council had turned down

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.520
an application to financially support the building of the center so it was funded simply from

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:02.800
collections from the local community and so what became a center then to some degrees became a

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:12.000
fortress not only because of elements of gross racism and graffiti and so on but simply because

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.800
of the tendency for a community to turn in upon itself if there is not an active warm welcome

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:29.760
from the host community or so we broached the issue with the community elders and they thought it was

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:40.720
a good idea and so Stuart spent a time in the spring of 88 I think I'm right in saying or 87

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.800
and I in the autumn of 87 looking at traditional folk theaters in both north and southern

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.720
India I think it is um

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:59.520
it was very valuable for us to be able to draw some comparative picture of the state of

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:07.760
folk theater in India predominantly rural folk theater um in retrospect it seemed terrifyingly

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:15.280
obvious that we should have brought a Gujarati company so that the community would have been

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.480
able to speak to the performers and whilst that's what we did it's one of those things

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:26.560
that research throws up you don't the obvious isn't clear until you've been around the houses

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:32.000
you don't know what your own front door looks like until you've been into the next street so

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:40.240
following that research um arrangements were made for uh the predominant form in in Gujarat

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:51.520
called Bhavai which a company had never been outside India before to bring a something like

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:59.360
15 16 17 people a synthesis of two troops together with um their supporters and from

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:06.640
the administrative office from the National Theatre of India in Bombay to to bring a troop

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:15.920
to Wales to make a new production uh to tour shows of their own and and to create

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.040
as as big a splash as we could uh as an example of a living vibrant

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:32.400
non-classical traditional art form that at its grassroots level was still hugely popular

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:41.520
which meant that um companies Bhavai companies toured in rural Gujarat they would arrive at a

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:49.920
village uh perhaps at the weekend and would play a series of very brief extracts trailers

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:59.520
from their repertoire which was huge of both ballad operas and sung plays spoken plays and the

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.720
the villagers would choose which pieces they wanted to see so it was like cinema trailers

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.640
so this was an entirely fascinating tradition um a six and seven hundred year old tradition

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:19.360
terms of age that we're used to thinking about classical theater in Asia no in Japan and so on

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:29.520
but that had survived that stayed the same by changing as many populist and folk traditions

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:37.520
do by by continually updating and changing their material so they came to Wales where we

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:46.640
this time we chose the narrative material of Tumshan Khatti the Welsh bandit to outline a

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:52.800
problem that was unquestionably a problem in Wales in the 18th century and that still is in India where

00:16:53.360 --> 00:17:01.440
um fathers and mothers have lots of sons and um they divide the farms down into smaller and smaller

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:08.560
dimensions and areas and units that become economically unviable and young his son simply

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.920
go off and they either go to the city or they become outlaws they they live by robbing and

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:24.320
stealing because farming is no longer an option so we developed this production with

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:33.040
greater degree of community participation there was a great deal of communal pride in

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:41.280
these artistic cousins coming from India and and and showing off if you like to Britain the the

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.840
some of the cultural riches of of the state of Gujarat

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:54.560
uh in particular and they toured their own shows and we we did a number of workshops with the

00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:01.200
London International with lift the international festival for people and um BBC Wales made a tv

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:08.160
documentary and and so it made the event made a bigger splash as we hoped it would

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.480
um and by then I would think we were sort of making the work and doing the administration

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:23.760
but also trying to promote an active agenda of the virtues and the value of interculturalism of

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.000
people simply opening to others through participation in projects like this

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:38.720
is. So it was a spoken and sung in English, Welsh and Gujarati or Kutchis, Rusty,

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:47.120
piece which again produced a very positive reaction bigger waves I would say.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:59.200
I think that I have to say that we had many supporters from the Welsh language community

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.760
but I think there were also it's fair to say um naysayers who found this

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.920
agenda a muddying of waters that they wished only to exist between Welsh speakers and English

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:22.000
speakers and um who in other words were simply wishing to edit out the reality of the multi-ethnic

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.400
communities of Swansea, Cardiff, Newport and a little bit in

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:35.680
Connors Quay in northeastern Wales that uh this didn't simply figure in their picture of Wales.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:41.360
We understand the kind of cultural breakdown and talk about one individual's sense of what Wales

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:47.440
means to them what their Wales is uh and I was naive naive enough to be

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:56.000
shocked I think by some of the arguments sometimes heated arguments

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:06.880
um that uh I think in all soberness that uh reeked of um straightforward fascism.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:15.040
I need to say that people who are saying these people should simply be deported or given the

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.080
opportunity at best to learn to speak fluent Welsh in one year. All those failing some kind of

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:28.800
test should be deported. I heard this from scores of people so it was some group of people's notion

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.920
of an agenda at that time so I'm simply wanting to draw attention to the fact that this this

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:42.720
reasonably enough ideas transformative ideas are never received smoothly and there were um

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.000
um people who were consciously against such an agenda.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:58.800
Um the trilogy continued and and grew a pace I remember in particular as we moved on to the third

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:06.640
play that the the participatory elements and some of the tasters that Tally-Es-In some of the things

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.000
that Tally-Es-In, Tally-Es-In Wales were bringing to Cardiff for the first time

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:18.080
you know the whole idea of a multicultural community orchestra um I can remember organising

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:27.680
first ever Ghanaian drumming sessions as part of these projects um I think I am right when I suspect

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.360
the roots of Samba Galez are probably in there as well as we began to explore community percussion

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:39.680
in lots of different ways so um take us on to community play number three because

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:48.080
your observations are absolutely acute Steve in that that in and around and after Tumsun Katty

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:59.120
uh we were all very much well aware of simply the time it took to it would took at least a year to

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:06.640
develop the various strands to make beginning such a production feasible, organisational,

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:12.720
financial, particularly organisational but at the ground level that is to say in South Cardiff we

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:23.520
wanted to try to push a little bit or or um expand out from the samargin organising events

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:34.960
um in South Cardiff or anywhere really um that would function on their own function on their own

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:45.600
right but also hopefully feed into uh the the larger shows which would make community involvement

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:53.520
that much more real that much fuller and that's much more enjoyable so we ran

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:02.880
cross-cultural music concerts in chapter we ran a community orchestra we did projects in schools

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:09.200
including two that I remember with great and profound pleasure in a school for the deaf and

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:16.320
hearing impaired and sully one with a South Asian and um uh Welsh team and one with an African

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:25.280
Caribbean group um both particularly percussion and drum base that was received I have truly to

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:32.320
say ecstatically by the school the children many of whom were resident and the head teacher and it

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.960
was a great source of sorrow that we couldn't when the money ran out that we couldn't carry those on

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:44.640
that they're some of the projects that I feel proudest of so we were looking for opportunities

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:54.880
to to run dance classes drama classes um through the year to to to widen the net to to build the

00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:03.360
the links of the web uh to connect more people with more people through art so that was a kind

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:11.280
of significant shift which meant that we were um working locally through the year on those kinds

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:17.840
of projects um taking on people because you can't do everything running projects uh one in a Welsh

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.280
language junior school in specifically in relation to some of the things I've just been saying um

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:33.120
um so I think that expansion of activity is an important

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:43.680
um growth and development probably between the second and third of this I'd call them a triad

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.760
more than a trilogy uh because they weren't they weren't uh directly thematically linked but they

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.760
were they were politically linked by the underlying premises of our intercultural

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:03.920
premise or premises and so the third piece

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:13.920
playing fast and loose with the legend of Madog uh the 13th century Welsh prince who sailed away

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:22.160
from north Wales and allegedly discovered America and that there is a memory with the

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:30.000
Mandan indigenous American people just west of the Mississippi of blue-eyed and blonde haired ancestors

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:42.880
uh that we involved not only other Asian groups the Punjabi um Bangra group of young people and

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:50.400
an African Caribbean young girls or teenage girls dance group as well as you were saying Steve a

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:59.360
sort of cross-cultural uh percussion group so we were looking at all kinds of resources and um

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:06.320
we had a dear colleague of mine whose early death saddens me as I speak of it uh Elvira Lewis

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.840
where else in the world would you have a minister who leads a double life as an actor it's

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.480
I'm sure there are elsewhere but it's a peculiarly kind of Welsh set of circumstances

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:23.120
and one of our South Asian supporters playing Queen Elizabeth singing um jailhouse rock

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.880
at the end of part one so that's what I mean by saying playing fast and loose with cultural

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:38.080
references and creating a kind of playground where men can play women anybody could be anybody

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:45.760
by adopting costumes by by mutual agreement by a set of circumstances affinities playground rules

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:52.640
of saying this is just like a children's dressing room where here are the costumes let's try on what

00:26:52.640 --> 00:27:05.120
we like and see what kind of roles we might care to play out and so um in that the third piece was

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:12.240
a promenade uh the previous piece had been two-sided and four-sided seating in the

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:19.200
rectangular samarj but madhok was a promenade piece the audience stood and we simply acted amongst them

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:31.760
and the the premise that of anybody could be Welsh if as the historian who wrote the book

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:39.120
Gwynedd William said if you make his view as a marxist internationalist if you make a commit to

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:46.080
Wales what's the problem with being Welsh a view that we espoused and very glad that he came and

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.720
said a few words on the opening night of the show and was 100 behind the project

00:27:50.720 --> 00:28:03.200
of making it globally available we speak largely in the current times about

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.320
on the one hand how

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:14.560
colossal theoretical sums of money pass in a nanosecond around the globe they're simply noughts

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.200
on a computer screen but the movement of peoples at the moment the focus is on

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.760
Africa and the Mediterranean and people drowning in boats globalization produces

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.400
changes some of which are difficult and challenging to deal with

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:40.160
as our ideas about what our work meant and what it might mean and what its potential significance

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:50.720
that it was a response to changing circumstances that in the intervening years have changed even

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:57.440
further this movement of peoples has not stopped it is simply one of the most significant features

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:05.680
of the world we live in like it or not that is the case and so I think that we hope artists have

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:13.280
their antennae out and are looking at social trends so whilst as artists I wouldn't pretend

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:19.600
that our priority wasn't with solving the aesthetic problems that we set ourselves

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.280
we were at in and of the same time and especially discussions with you Steve

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:31.520
continually sifting and resifting and thinking about how are people who are opposed to this

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:40.000
what might they think was this simply bigotry or fear of change which we all recognize in ourselves

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:47.360
of the people who came and said I couldn't recognize my own country at one of our performances

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:54.800
at which we we have to reflect on the kind of subjective nature of of what or confusing the

00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:01.840
subjective and and the kind of officially approved view of Wales that you largely see

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:08.560
it for example it's one picture of Wales I'm not against it it's not illegitimate but it's not the

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:16.000
only one and it's that sense that that many projections and images overlap conflict yes they

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:23.280
do conflict but many overlap and that is the kind of kaleidoscopic social situation we were in then

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.880
and we were hoping the work would reflect so what seems to be quite clear is in terms of

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:35.600
Swicker's origins and again you know the birth of Cardiff Carnival that Theatre Taliesin Wales

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:42.880
certainly for me was a a fabulous eye-opener and that some of the central tenants that

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:48.960
I took and helped make the foundation for Swicker were the the interculturalism

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:57.520
the openness of spirit the importance of involving and being inclusive and accessible

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.960
and probably most important because these were fabulous groundbreaking works which still stand

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:11.840
the test of time today which was that the upbeat and ultimately life-affirming and

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:20.800
celebratory nature of what Theatre Taliesin was doing the the come down for the you know hundreds

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:27.120
who took part or watched particularly the participants at the end of a 10-week making

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:37.280
period for the theatre was massive and so it it it created it's shone a shone a beacon as to what

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.160
might be possible and could be possible in addition to all the great work with Taliesin

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.440
was doing so we're going to return to this conversation in a couple of weeks

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Nigel can I thank you very much indeed for that you're most welcome Steve and I'd just like to

00:31:52.560 --> 00:32:00.880
to conclude at length not too great a length by simply saying that even though it was difficult

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:07.280
for us at the time I think that the growth I my view of the growth of sugar is simply that

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:18.320
that I think like all good work in any form in the performing arts somehow if it's localized if it's

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:24.480
if it's based in a great spirit of place generates further ideas which ripple out

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:33.440
and in terms of our you know there were three of us really the organization couldn't sustain

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.800
the amount of work that people wanted to do and so that we split the company in two and thought

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:48.000
that that would be the best way forward to promote a specifically grassroots community events program

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.440
that could garner a great deal more money whilst we looked at at perhaps working abroad or

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.600
elsewhere where people said well why don't you come and do something with us

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.400
it didn't work out for Taliesin partly for health reasons and I should say that many people working

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:13.120
in new work experimental modes of performance groundbreaking there's often a great health

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:22.640
strain because three people did eight people's work for a long time and I don't wish to be

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:29.440
in any way mawkish but but this is true of so many organizations so the idea of modest financial

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:35.040
financial remuneration to to round the clock working easy to shrug at but it should be

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:41.440
remembered that these things don't happen without a certain level of obsessiveness by those people

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:50.480
involved and it takes its toll so I'm absolutely delighted to go on the record to say that I

00:33:50.480 --> 00:34:00.400
congratulate Steve on his what 30 years 25 25 of swicker and and that the carnival mode that he

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:07.680
chose that seems to me the absolutely correct one to maximize all the kind of potential creativities

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:14.720
of its participants when I was talking about a room full of a children's room full of

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:21.680
costumes and masks and anything can be anything that could expand everybody's individual creativity

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:29.280
so I wish the company and if as long as he wants it another 25 years if he wants

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.720
it. Heartiest congratulations. Thank you very much. We're equally cursed and blessed by that I think.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.480
Take care.
