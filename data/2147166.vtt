WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Also where...

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Sorry, what's this term?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yeah, what your full name is and where were you born?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Okay, my full name is Elijah...

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The get up spelling later...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Modena Salisuo...

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Modena Selatio...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Salisuo...

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And where were you born?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Can I spell it for you?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We can do that outside when we do the form, but this is my note...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Oh, okay...

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And then we'll do the official form with Donald...

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And where were you born?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Nigeria...

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What part of Nigeria?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Lagos...

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Lagos, Nigeria...

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Okay...

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Elijah...

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Are you a Muslim?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Yeah, Elijah...

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Elijah...

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But when you go to Hajj, they call you Elijah...

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So that is why I'm bearing Elijah...

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You understand now?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Yeah, so as a feminine...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Is that right?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Yes, it's feminine...

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Okay, so...

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Do you write it correct now?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I've...

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Because instead of Hajj, it's Ajja...

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Elijah...

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You could have heard it before...

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Anybody that goes to Hajj, they call it Elijah...

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
They call men Alaji...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Alaji...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Yes...

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Okay, cool...

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
My name is Modena...

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I think you can't...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Modena...

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
M-E-G-I-N-A...

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Yes, kind...

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Is that okay?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Yes, it's okay...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Donald will get the official spelling...

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So it's correct on the form...

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But this is just for conversation...

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
These are notes for me...

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So I can have the conversation better...

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So tell me about Lagos and Nigeria...

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
What do you remember of that area?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What do you remember growing up there?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Family, friends, the food...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
What can you remember?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Well, I'm not growing up in Lagos...

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I was growing up in Ijebu and Ibado...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
In Nigeria...

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Lagos is the former capital of Nigeria...

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So I was growing up in Ijebu, Gosti and Oyo State, Ibado...

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So I can remember that...

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I go to school...

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Primary school...

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
My primary school is...

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Muscle and Primary School, Ijebu and Moshi...

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So after that...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I continued my secondary school in Ayikwe High School, Ijebu Ayikwe...

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Then from that, I moved down to Ibado...

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I started doing business...

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I started selling spare parts...

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Motor spare parts...

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I'm one of the distributors of glass industry...

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
No-skin glass, TSD and Isoglass...

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
TSD and Isoglass...

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
They are the only ones that produce glass in Africa...

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Isoglass is the first in Africa...

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
While TSD is the second in Africa...

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
That TSD as...

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
As modern...

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
As another factory in UK here...

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Which ever you see any glass motor...

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
That they put TSD in, triples...

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Have you ever seen?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Okay...

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
If you look at your door of your car...

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
At times you will see triples here...

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
There's a grade of glass...

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Yes...

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
They have company in Nigeria...

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I'm one of the distributor...

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And I'm the only lady that...

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Have their distributing...

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Though they have now closed down...

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
They closed down in 2005...

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
After I left Nigeria...

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
When I was in Nigeria, I was a big business woman...

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Selling glass motor...

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Isoglass...

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And...

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And spare parts...

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
For cars and lorries...

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So...

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Then...

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Suddenly because my ex-husband...

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Is a nurse...

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So the calling...

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
He apply here...

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So the...

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
When he apply here...

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
They call him to come and work here...

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So he travel in 2003...

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So when he travel in 2003...

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Then...

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
He has to come and meet him in 2004...

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
That's why I left my business to come and join him...

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Do you know what Pethu called him?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Can I own that?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Sure...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
You can tell her how you wish...

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So when I join him...

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Before we arrive here in the UK...

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I've got questions about UK...

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Can you tell me about like...

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
What was the place like growing up?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Like, you know...

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
What memories you have?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
What games did you play?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Okay...

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Well...

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
What good memories you have?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You may have some bad memories...

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Yes, yes, yes...

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I didn't have...

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I can't say I have bad memories in Nigeria...

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
But...

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I have very good memories...

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Because I come from the...

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I come from the rich house...

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
My family are very rich...

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Because...

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
My first travelling is...

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
1986...

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I go to Hatch to perform Hatch...

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
That time...

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So...

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Then...

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Because of my family background...

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
When I got married in 2009...

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
In 1990...

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
When I got married...

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
We...

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
When...

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
In Africa...

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
When we are celebrating...

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
We invite the musicians to come and play music for us...

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So...

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The musicians they play for...

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
They play...

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Play in that...

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
My marriage ceremony is Salawa Bene...

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And Waka System...

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Okay...

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And...

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I enjoy my childhood...

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But as you asked that...

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Which kind of play that we play...

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
No...

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
We don't have...

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
We just have outside play...

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
When I was little...

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
But...

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
That outside play...

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I don't know how to describe it...

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Because we play...

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
We play outside...

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Like using stones...

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
To play...

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
By...

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
When...

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Can I describe it?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Okay...

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
That play is...

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We line...

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
We use a stick to line the floor...

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Then we put stone...

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We throw stone...

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Then we do like this...

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Who's going to catch it?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Hopscotch...

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Yeah, you call it hopscotch...

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Okay...

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Okay...

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So...

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Only that good there without...

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Without...

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Rolling down or...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Without shaking...

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
That is perfect...

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So to pick the...

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
That is the type of play that I play...

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
When my youth...

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
When I was little...

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Good...

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So you...

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So...

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
You had quite a playful childhood...

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Simple...

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Yes...

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Not too stressful...

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Not stressful...

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So let's go to the UK then...

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
You arrived in UK...

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And then when I arrived...

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
What year did you arrive?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
2004...

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
2004...

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Can you remember...

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
The first week...

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
What did it feel like?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Yeah...

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Okay...

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The first week I arrived...

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I arrived UK...

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Is that...

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Okay, let's start from the first day...

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
First day, start there...

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Okay...

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
When I arrived in UK...

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
The first day...

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
See, when I want to sleep...

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I asked my...

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
That my...

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Is that...

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Please close the door...

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And lock it...

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Because you didn't lock it...

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
You just jammed it...

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So there's no need for that...

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I said, why...

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
If somebody just come in...

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Say no, no, no, no...

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
There's no need...

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Then I asked about the iron gates...

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Because in our country...

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
That is the main...

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Risk...

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Because there's no security...

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So when they said me...

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
No, no, no, no...

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
There's no...

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Come and look...

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
There's no iron gate...

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
There's nothing...

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Okay...

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I'm now thinking...

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
That...

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
It is how people live here...

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
No security...

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
You said if anything happen...

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Just die, die, die...

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
They will come now...

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
You say...

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Wow...

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
That's fine...

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So...

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I said, why...

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Why did you lock it?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Because you didn't lock it...

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Because you didn't lock it...

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Because you didn't lock it...

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Because you didn't lock it...

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Because you didn't lock it...

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Because you didn't lock it...

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Since that day...

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I think...

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I must leave here...

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Instead of me to go back...

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Because...

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
In Nigeria...

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I have everything...

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
People are having...

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I don't have any problem...

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
But the problem is security...

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
You cannot move without fear...

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Even when there is...

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Huts there...

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
But still...

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
You have to wind up...

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Using your aircon...

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And in the house...

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
You have to do wiring...

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Fence...

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Big fence...

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Everything too...

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And...

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
That's it...

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So when I arrive here...

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Security is the...

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
My main...

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Thing that I leave...

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
What was the weather like?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
It was very different...

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Okay, yes...

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Weather is different...

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Yes...

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
That one is natural...

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
That one is natural...

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So as far as...

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Okay, how was your first winter?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Yes...

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Because...

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
The time that I come is summertime...

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Summertime...

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Then I...

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
When it's time for night...

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Seven days...

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
See...

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Moon outside...

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
He said...

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Wow...

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So...

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The night will never fall...

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
In this country...

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Then he is telling me that...

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
The night will fall but...

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It's going to be around...

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
After nine...

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Ten o'clock...

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I said...

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Wow...

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Ah...

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I like it...

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So...

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I'm happy...

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
But...

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Then I asked him...

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
How am I going to pray?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
He is telling me that...

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
There is an app...

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
That we are going to follow the app...

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Whatever the...

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Announcements are done for...

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
That it's time for prayer...

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Yes...

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Then I think that...

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
How am I going to do my Ramadan?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Because...

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
How am I going to fast until...

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Ten o'clock in the night?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
He said...

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Maybe during the Ramadan...

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
It's going to fall...

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
During the time that...

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
It's going to be winter...

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I said...

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So there is winter...

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Now he is telling me...

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
How the weather is...

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Summer...

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Winter...

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So...

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
He said...

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Okay, I will wait...

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I'm so lucky that that time...

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Is winter...

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
It's Ramadan...

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So we have to fast from...

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Ten o'clock...

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Ramadan...

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
So we have to fast from...

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Six till...

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Four o'clock...

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
In the evening...

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
So that is it...

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So it was okay...

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But you were able to pray...

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Which is a bit complicated...

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
But you got that...

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Yes...

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Okay...

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Can you tell me about...

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
How you settled into the UK...

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So like...

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Maybe making friends...

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Or meeting Age Alive...

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Or whatever it was...

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
What did you do to...

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
To socialise...

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And to bring your cultural practice here to the UK...

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Okay...

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Well...

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I don't have to rely...

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Because...

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
As I told you...

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
That before I come here...

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I come from rich family...

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So I don't have time for friends...

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
For friendship in my own country...

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Because...

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
When I left secondary school...

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I joined my family in business...

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So...

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
It was...

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
All my friends...

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
We happened to meet in the shop...

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
After the shop...

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I'm not saying more...

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
That means...

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Those people who are beside me...

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
That's telling me...

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And most of them they are men...

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
No women among them...

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Only...

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
The women among them is those people that marry the man...

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
But...

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I'm the only one that is young...

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
That I'm a woman among them...

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
The young people there too is men...

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
So that is why...

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
There is no...

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I can't...

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I cannot go and play with them...

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
On Saturdays we used to do parties...

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
A lot in my country...

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
But I'm not attending...

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Because I don't have women friend...

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So...

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I just keep on to my shop...

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
To my shop...

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Understand?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And...

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
When I come here...

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Then on Sunday I just used to...

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Wash my clothes...

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Set myself down with my children...

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Because...

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
I have housemaid...

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
That doing...

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Housework for me...

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Taking care of my children...

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Like that...

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
In shop too I have houseboys...

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
That used to help me sell my markets...

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I would just go to the company...

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Sit down in my shop...

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
At times reading Quran...

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
At times just talking to customer...

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
When they bring the customer in...

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
So that is why I don't have time to socialize with people...

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
But when I come here...

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
You know what I'm not doing before...

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
So...

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I never...

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I never worked in any company before...

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I never had monthly salary before...

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So all that one I started here...

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So when I come here after two months...

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I started looking for a job...

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
So when I reach one place I ask them...

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
When they want to give me job...

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
They ask me...

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Have you ever do this type of job?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I say no no no...

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I'm a self employed...

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I never do it before...

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And...

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
They said no they can't give me work...

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Because...

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I will not know how to do it...

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
If you teach me how to do it I will do it...

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Because I'm over 40...

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So...

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I know what I'm doing...

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
So then they employ me...

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So when they employ me...

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I started working with them...

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Then...

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
One of our town friends here...

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Come to tell me...

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Because he's the one that stand for me as guarantee...

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
So...

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
He's telling me that...

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Where they put me to...

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Is too far from house...

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
That I'm going to use all my...

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Money on FOI...

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
So...

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Then I tell them...

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
When they angry with me that...

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Oh they told you that you can't do it...

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I said...

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
If you have anyone in this city it's okay...

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I said no...

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Okay...

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
So then I left them...

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
I work in another place...

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
So I left them...

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
I started looking for another job...

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Then I get another job...

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
So that is how I started working...

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I work in industry for a year...

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Then after that...

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
They stopped me...

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
What industry is this?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Bikri...

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Bikri...

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Afana Bikri...

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Afana Bikri...

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
So I worked there for a year...

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
So when I worked there for a year...

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Then they stopped me...

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I don't know...

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I thought that they employed me fully...

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
You know...

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I don't know anything...

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
But when they stopped me...

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Then I said...

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Why did I do wrong?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
They said no you didn't do anything wrong...

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
You are not a full employee...

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Just hire you because...

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Some people are sick or some people go on...

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
What do you do?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
So then I started looking for another job...

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Then I got a job for...

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Newport City Council...

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
At school...

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
So then I started doing cleaning job...

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Since that...

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
That is 2005...

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Till now...

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I am still working with them...

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
So tell me about your culture...

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Muslim...

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
What practices do you...

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Still practice that you did in Nigeria...

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
That you do here...

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Food...

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Music...

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Religion...

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Faith...

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
What do you still use here?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Okay...

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
You know...

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
As I told you that...

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
I am a Muslim...

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
My parents are Muslim...

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
But...

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
They are Muslim by mouth...

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
They used to pray five times in a day...

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
But they don't know...

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
They don't know much about it...

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Because they are Muslim by...

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
How do I call it...

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I forgot the name that I want to use...

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
For them...

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
So...

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
But...

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
The...

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
But when I want to marry...

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
When I am about to marry...

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
My man...

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
My ex-man...

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
That time...

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I introduced him to the house...

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
That this is my man...

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I want to marry...

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Firstly...

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
When they send me to Hajj...

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
They don't send me to Hajj...

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Because they know about Islam...

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
They send me to Hajj...

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Because they have money...

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
To go and perform Hajj...

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Because in our country...

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Hajj works...

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
They respect those people who have money...

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
They respect those people who go to Hajj...

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
To perform Hajj...

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
That is why...

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
When we come back from Hajj...

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Whenever your name...

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Your name will now change...

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Understand?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Like...

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Me in that ambian in Medina...

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
When I come back from Hajj...

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
They will call me that name again...

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
They will now call me Aladja... Aladja...

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Do you understand?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Do you understand now?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
So...

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
If you are a man...

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
When you come back...

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
They will now call you Aladja...

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
So wherever you go...

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
When the head is...

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Ah! This one is Aladja...

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
They will give you more respect...

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
So...

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
That is it...

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Apart from that...

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
We have Christians...

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
We have Muslims...

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
We have traditional religions...

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
That we are living together happily...

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
In every family...

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
We see the three...

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
That three religions...

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
That is Islam...

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Christianity...

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
And...

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Tradition...

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
In the family...

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
So...

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And it depends on...

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Which one you belong to...

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
During the...

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
During the...

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Idil Kebid festival...

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
And Idil Fitri festival...

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
They will come to us to do...

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Our festival...

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
The Christian will come...

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
The traditional people will come...

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Excuse me then...

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
When they do their own festival...

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
We join them...

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
We do it together...

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
And...

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
In my family...

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
They like...

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
They are socialites...

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
That is what I want to say...

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
They are Muslim socialites...

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
They like social...

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
They used to drink alcohol...

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
They used to play...

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
They...

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
They invite musicians...

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Whenever we want to do something...

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
We invite musicians...

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Musicians will come here to play for us...

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
But...

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
When I want to marry...

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Then...

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Apart from that one...

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
It is part of our culture...

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
That...

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Rich people will not marry...

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Those people who are not rich...

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
They are against it...

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
So...

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And as for me...

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
When I want to marry...

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
I decide not to do that...

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
But my parents are against it...

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
The fight...

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
That no...

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
I will not marry them...

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
But in our home...

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
We are not choosing for our guests...

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
And they are not choosing for our men too...

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
You choose whoever you like...

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Then when you bring them home...

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
The family will now debate...

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
That...

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Is it good for you or is it not good for you...

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Then...

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
When I choose my own husband...

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
They said no...

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
But...

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I should not marry him...

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
That he is going to disrespect me in Fushu...

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Because...

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
If he has money in Fushu...

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
He will go for another lady...

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Then I said...

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Okay...

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Let's try...

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Because he said he will never do that...

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Because when he goes to the screw of nothing...

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
I give...

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
I used to give him pocket money...

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Because he doesn't have money on his side...

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
But at that time...

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Nigeria is still good...

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
The government sponsored him...

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
So I just gave him pocket money...

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
When I am about to introduce him to my house...

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Because our own Koshu...

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
That's why I said...

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
They don't know much about Islam...

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
We have boyfriends...

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
We have gay friends...

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Like this place...

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
But the difference is that...

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
We don't call them...

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Boyfriend or gay friend...

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
If...

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
If anybody has shite for you...

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
It's your wife...

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
No matter...

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Whether you do the marriage or not...

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Understand?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
And...

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
If at all, if you didn't have shite for you...

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
But you are living together...

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
They will call you husband and wife...

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
So you may not do marriage at last...

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
You will do...

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
So...

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Like me now...

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Because they are against it...

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
My family is against it...

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
But I decided that's what I want to do...

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
So at the end of the day...

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
When he finishes school...

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
My family asks me that...

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Okay, if you said that's the person you want to marry...

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
We are going to release you...

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Because I told them that...

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
If I don't marry him, I won't marry him...

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Because that time I was full...

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Because I realized what they told me...

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
That's what he did...

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
When he went bikini...

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
So...

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
And that time I...

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Think that...

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
He is my first man...

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
I will not leave him...

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Unless he said I don't want...

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
I will stay with him...

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Then when he finishes school...

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Then my parents ask me...

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Where is he going to live?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
I said he is going to look for work...

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
He said, no, you can come to this site and look for work...

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Then they give us a flat...

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Complete building...

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
So we lived together there for 15 years...

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Without paying cover...

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
He didn't know how I prepared the food for him...

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
He didn't know how I prepared the food for him...

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
He didn't know how I prepared the food for him...

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
He didn't know how I prepared the food for him...

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
I prepared the food for him...

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
I prepared the food for him...

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
He never spent on my children...

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
I have four boys...

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
He never paid their school fees...

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Because in Nigeria you pay your school fees...

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Anything you want you do not like here...

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
That you can go to hospital free...

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
You can do this free...

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
You did everything with your money...

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
You did everything with your money...

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
So everything we did in Nigeria...

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Before he came here he knew nothing about it...

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
So everything we did in Nigeria...

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.640
He lived with me for 15 years...

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.880
He has two brothers that came to live with me...

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
And is one of his friends...

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.240
They are four that come to my house to live...

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.840
They live in Nigeria three times a day...

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.840
Because in Nigeria we eat three times a day...

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.120
We are not used to eat this one...

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.120
Eat this one...

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.120
Eat this one...

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.120
At any time...

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.120
No...

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.040
We eat three times a day...

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.040
Only...

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.040
We are not using to drink.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:21.040
You know, just, you know, when you eat something, you drink, you hit at any time, you're like,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:27.040
no, our eating based on the time we did it.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:36.040
So, we lived together for, before we do the wedding, we lived together.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.040
I have my first born in 1988.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.040
In Nigeria.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.040
In Nigeria. All my children were born in Nigeria.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.040
So, I have my first born in 1988.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:56.040
And at the end of the day, my parents said, okay, we are going to do the wedding.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:01.040
Because his father said, his father insisted that he want to do the wedding.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.040
Of course.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.040
They wanted to do the wedding in 1990.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:15.040
So, when we do the wedding, they spend a lot of money on me and do everything as they're supposed to do.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.040
That's why I said, I enjoy a lot.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.040
It's when I come here. It's a change.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:34.040
What they tell me in 1986, when I bring in O to meet my parents, is now coming up.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:40.040
When I come here, you know, it's now in us.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.040
I'm now here.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:49.040
It's now telling me that we do mistake by marrying after not five years together.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.040
So, you know, it's lost.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:29:00.040
But unfortunately, when I come here too, I started to work in, I don't have friends.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:07.040
I keep to myself as I don't like to have friends before.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.040
No, I told you from shop to house, from shop to house, from shop to house.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:21.040
But when I come here and I started working, I face my work, I make friends within the working environment.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.040
After the working, everybody goes to work as I'm doing before.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:35.040
But unfortunately, when it left me in 2015, all my children who are growing up, they all married.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:44.040
Because when I reached here, I started to continue studying Islam.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:56.040
When I started studying Islam, I grew up with it much more better than Nigeria.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:04.040
Because that time, I want to practice it as it is supposed to be practiced.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:12.040
My family are getting annoyed with me.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:20.040
If I tell them, you are doing what is not good, you spend a lot on nonsense.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.040
You don't have to do this really.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:29.040
But they are telling me that I go astray. I go astray. I go astray.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.040
Do you understand?

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:39.040
But when I was here, I started to use what I read before.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:47.040
Because now I'm lonely. I don't see my parents again. I don't see anybody again except him.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:56.040
When we arrived in 2004, I noticed him that he changed.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:01.040
You never drink alcohol at home, but he is now drinking alcohol.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.040
And it's now changed.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.040
When I told him, you have four boys, they never see you drinking alcohol.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.040
He said, oh, you are in the UK, you can do whatever you like.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:19.040
Do whatever you like. UK means you came.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.040
That is how it started.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:35.040
At the end of the day, 2015, when his children got married, he decided, oh, he wants me out of the house.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:43.040
That is how I'm now thinking that.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.040
He wants me out of this house.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:50.040
And before I continue.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.040
So how did you find Age Alive as a project?

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.040
Yes, that is where I'm going.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:04.040
My children support me because I spent a lot of time with them.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.040
They know that I never do anything except that I bring them here.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.040
And when I bring them here, I leave them with me.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:18.040
That is why I started working immediately.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:25.040
So tell me about how you have grown and what does Age Alive feel?

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.040
That is where I am going.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:33.040
If not because he left, I wouldn't know Age Alive.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:41.040
My children, when they marry, they marry white people.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:46.040
And they convert them into Muslim.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:51.040
So I now follow their groups.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:58.040
They converted Muslims and Muslims, born Muslims.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.040
So they do the gathering, then I go to their gathering.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:09.040
When I go to their gathering, I have to stop some working.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.040
Some of my work.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:21.040
At times I work almost 24 hours a day because it is in my blood before.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.040
Before I come here, I work 12 hours a day from 6 to 6.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.040
So I have to drop some of my work.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:37.040
Now I face my grandchildren, my daughter-in-law.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.040
So we move together.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:46.040
That is why as we are moving from one place to another, that is how I met Age Alive.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.040
How has life been since Age Alive?

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.040
I enjoy them.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:58.040
When they introduced Age Alive to me, they said they are doing exercise.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.040
Everyone is doing.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.040
They tell me the time.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.040
I say, that is fine.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.040
All the work I can do, I can do it.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.040
My work starts at 3 o'clock.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.040
It is okay.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:19.040
So then I continue with them.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.040
Then when I am with them, we talk a lot.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:29.040
I told them that if people suffer before they come here, I never suffer.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.040
I suffer in this country.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.040
I didn't suffer from government.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.040
I suffer from the person that brought me to the country.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:42.040
But government, yes, fear for me.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:48.040
Because if they didn't fear for me, I would have left the house.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:54.040
Then we would have been able to marry.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:00.040
Because if it was my country, we would have been able to marry again.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:08.040
Because we would have left my mother's, my parents' house and built our home.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:15.040
Or if we didn't go and build our home, we have houses that we built already.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.040
We would have packed and left outside.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.040
Understand?

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.040
With another lady that won't see us for life when he has money.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:31.040
Because when he brings us here because he has money, that's why he does that.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:41.040
And if it was my country, people would now tell me that, yes, yes, he is still your husband.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.040
You have to submit.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.040
You have to do this.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.040
You have to do that.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.040
That is the difference.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:54.040
That if you want to go and let him go, you can remarry.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.040
Let him have his own life.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.040
And I'm happy with that statement.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:04.040
I'm happy with that statement that let him have his own life.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.040
Let me have my own life.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:10.040
But I will not go against my Quran.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:16.040
Because Quran tells us not to have a girlfriend or boyfriend.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.040
Not to go into prostitution.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:29.040
I limit myself by having fun with people but not to have any intercourse with anybody.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.040
That is why I love this country for that.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.040
So I'm free.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:40.040
Though my parents are Tundu, I don't have a mother or father again.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.040
But I still have brothers.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.040
They tell me that.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.040
Remember, we told you, you have to submit.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.040
I said no.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.040
Forget about submitting.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.040
If he goes the wrong way, I won't follow him.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.040
I will go the right way.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.040
I will do the right one.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.040
The right one is to be on my own.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.040
To do my life as I like.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.040
That is why I like Ece Life.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.040
I enjoy them.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:20.040
But unfortunately, when there is the pandemic, I have to get another job.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:31.040
And that job is tying me down up to now that I cannot make up to go to their club.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.040
Times will change.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.040
Times will change in time.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.040
Yes, times will change.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:46.040
My final question is, if your great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren are researching their great-great-great-great-grandmother,

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.040
what message would you leave them in this archive?

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:55.040
The message I want to leave them is to be good.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:01.040
First of all, they should do religion by practicing Islam.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:13.040
Because before I started really practicing, you know I told you that when I go to Hajj, I know nothing about Islam.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:16.040
My parents know nothing about Islam.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:22.040
They send me because they want people to respect me because they have money.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:29.040
And if they don't send me out to perform Hajj, people won't know that.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:33.040
Because you know you cannot put money on your body.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:38.040
But if they know that you have one great-great-great-great-great-grandmother,

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.040
they will respect you as I told you.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.040
Anybody that goes to Hajj, they will respect the person.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.040
So that's what they want from me.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:55.040
So when I come back, as I told you that we are Christians,

00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:03.040
the Christian people in my eyes, we are trading.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:09.040
They come together and they want me to join their religion.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:15.040
They are now preaching to me because they know that my parents are not deep Muslims.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.040
They don't know.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.040
So they started preaching to me.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.040
Then I decided that I want to join them.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.040
I want to join them.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.040
That's fine.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.040
Then I told my foolish mother and father that I want to join Christianity.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.040
They said, don't join them.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.040
I said, why?

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.040
They said, okay.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.040
Then they give me a comparative book.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.040
Excuse me.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.040
So I read it.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.040
When I read it, I shall learn them.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.040
I ask them.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.040
It is what you call the gospel.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.040
Then they know that I know what is inside their Bible.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.040
So they now say, oh, don't go near Elijah.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.040
Don't go near her because she's not possessed.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.040
She's not possessed.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.040
So that's why they don't know.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:02.040
That's why I know that wherever I go in the world, my Islam is number one.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:09.040
Unless you tell me, you bring me another book that telling me is not right.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:14.040
So that is what that is the legacy I want to give my great grand children.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.040
Firstly, you have to do Islam.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:23.040
Unless you tell me that you see another one.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:30.040
Because even inside the Quran, the Quran says that if they tell you something, read it and compare it with Quran.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.040
So I'm the best.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.040
So if you don't see anything, you have to do the best.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.040
That is number one.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.040
Then number two is that to be kind.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.040
If you are a Muslim, if you are a real Muslim, you have to be kind.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.040
Because whenever Quran tells us, Quran says pray and be kind.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.040
Pray and do good.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.040
Pray and do good.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:02.040
Wherever Quran mentions about prayer, it says do good.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.040
Do good and pray.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040
Do good and pray.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.040
And that is what we call humanity.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.040
Because if you do good to people, that is humanity.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.040
Then you serve your God.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.040
It is great.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.040
So that is what I want to give.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.040
Thank you very much.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.040
I have no other questions.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.040
Anything else you would like to say or add?

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:34.040
I mean, I think we've gone through Nigeria, we've arrived, gone through family, we've gone through some hardships to understand.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:40.040
We've talked about the importance of your faith and your message to your great-great-great-grandchildren.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.040
Anything else you would like to say, leave a message for?

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:48.040
The message is do good.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.040
Pray and do good.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.040
Pray to your God and do good.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.040
And don't just pray.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.040
Do the right thing.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.040
Do the right thing.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.040
That is Islam.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.040
Unless there is another one that comes up.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.040
Even in the Quran, the Quran tells us how he made mankind.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.040
That I am your maker.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.040
This is how I made you.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.040
And the scientist said, yes.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:18.040
What he says is correct.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:23.040
That nobody can see that except the God Almighty.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:32.040
So Alhamdulillah, that is the legacy I want to give my great-great-great-great-grandchildren.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.040
Thank you very much.
