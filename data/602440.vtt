WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So, first, can you repeat your name for the record?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Derek Hughes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Okay.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And are you originally from Swansea?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yes, I've lived in Swansea all my life.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
All your life?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yes.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Okay.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And so, when and why did you first become a supporter of Swansea?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well, I was in Swansea Technical School, which is down the bottom of White Street, and we

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
used to have boys from our school that played for the school boys.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Swansea school boys were a terrific team, one needed a shield, more than any other team,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
except for Manchester.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But then, as we got a bit older, we started to go down to see the Swans, and my great

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
friend in school is elder brother, Scryne, played for the Swans.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, Billy, Scryne and I, we got to know that we could sell programs for the Swans.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So, we used to sell 20 dozen programs.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They were thruppance each other at first, then six-pence, and used to get so much a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
dozen, it amounted to something like an old money.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We sold the 20 dozen, which we would, because in those days, it was always sold out.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You know, you'd get six and eight pence, you know, money, plus the tips.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Which years are we talking about?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This is 1948, the season 48, 49, 49, 50, and probably 50, 51.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And then, if you were lucky, you would get to put the half-time scores up.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And the half-time score box was on the small bank, and it was the best view in the ground

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of the match.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So, you were able to stay there.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And you'd get five shillings for that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So, all together, you'd come out of there with about a pound, which was like, I would

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
think, 20 or 30 pounds a day.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It was a lot of money, really.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And the half-time scores, then, you'd put them up, and people would look at their programme,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
you know, A, game A, the score.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And as a footnote, whatever the score with Cardiff was, because of the love-hate relationship,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
it would get a cheer.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So, if Cardiff were winning, hey!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
If Cardiff were losing, hey!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And that's still true to this day.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So, as I say, I used to stand at the top of the road leading down to what was the Arsenal

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
end, and the junction with St Helens Road.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And SEL programme was there, about one o'clock, just before the match.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'd started, go down, go in, and you could stand on the touchline and watch the game

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
at the very least.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Good, convenient.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And one morning of the match, I went to get my programme, and 13 and 14, and Rish Carter,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I don't know whether you've heard of him, but he was the rain moony of the day,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
rain-frooding London, I think it was Derby, because they were down there playing the Swans.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
He said to me, oh, son, and rub my hair.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And I haven't washed my hair since.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
He was an and-a-hole, so Tommy Lawton was a great player.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
You'd meet all these, and they were like all guys, and they were all men.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
They're good with kids, and we in general, you know.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So they'd give you autographs and you've got no problem.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And they'd say that the team in those days would consist of 11 internationals every game.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Oh, yeah, I went to them every game.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Albeit, they were Irish and Welsh internationals.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
There weren't any English.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The only Englishman who played regularly for them was a guy by the name of Weston.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
He wasn't an English international, but he played what was in those days centre-half.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And Roy Paul, who played left-half, was the first player from this country to go and play abroad in South America.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
In South America?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
He played for Bogota.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
He was a former Swans player.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Roy Paul went out there for a few years, but whilst he was here, he also played for Wales.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000
They were, in those days, the Swans, if they lost two of them games, it was a disaster.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Oh, really?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Yeah, they'd lose one, perhaps, or none at all.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Wouldn't win many home away games.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
But the underground would be packed, really.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You know, I don't know what the capacity was in those days, but just before the match over the Tannoy,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
they would announce which health and safety now would have a fit.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Please move further down so people could get in, you know, so on the big bank,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and be sort of standing shoulder-to-shoulder packed in there.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And they'd, us little kids, they'd pass us down over their heads, the crowd would, for us to stand in front.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Happy days, lovely boys.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And great games we saw.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
What's the greatest game you remember?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Well, I remember seeing John Charles playing down there, and his brother, Mel Charles.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And the Swans, as they say, I saw them down there when they were promoted then.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Later on, I told you, stick my son down.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
When, in the season, I think, when they got promoted to what is now the Premiership.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And in fact, they finished sixth that year in the Premiership.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Oh yeah, that was the greatest result.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
As a footnote, do you know that they're in the Guinness Book of Records?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Oh really?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Yes. What happened was Swans were relegated in consecutive seasons,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and had to apply for re-election to the league.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So they applied for the fourth division, they won promotion to the third, the second, and the Premiership in consecutive seasons.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And then they, I think, they went straight back down again.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And the sad thing about that was that the captain, I've forgotten his name now, but he started to play really badly,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and the crowd was to be wimped.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
A poor man had Parkinson's disease, and we didn't know.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
That's a sad note.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But in general, they were lovely days, and we used to enjoy the games.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And there was another footnote, there'd be one policeman there at the game, and he'd be watching the game.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And the spectators were integrated.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
They waged, and there'd be good-natured banter, but never any violence and fighting.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
In fact, when my son was 13, I'd been taking him down.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Then the skinheads arrived on the scene, and that stopped me taking him.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
When was that?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Well, my son was only 57.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Did that be 1970, say?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
You know, 70, 71, that kind of thing.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And that was skinhead.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But in general, the Vetch field, which got its name from?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I've heard a couple of stories about that.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
It's a weed called the Vetch.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
It's a weed that grows along the seafront.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And the weed is the Vetch.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It is.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
It's the weed field.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Really.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And there we are, really.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I'm still going to support them.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I'm hoping to get tickets for the game with West Ham.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
My son and I, my son is now 54.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And he and I, so I've got to, perhaps you can advise me how I can get hold of some tickets.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I shall phone the office and see.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Because the fixture list is coming out Saturday, the 23rd of June, for the coming season.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So once I know when West Ham are down here, I'm hoping it's more towards the end of the season.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And then I can get in touch and see if I can get a season ticket or not.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And unfortunately, there's only a couple of thousand tickets.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
It's quite difficult to get a ticket.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Do you know if they're going to extend the Liberty?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
There is provision for them to put another tier on the Liberty.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Really?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Yes.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Since they've got 40 million, I hope they do that.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Because they certainly have this approval.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Have you been to the Liberty Stadium?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Oh yes, indeed.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Do you like it?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Oh fabulous, fabulous.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Because the conditions down the Vetch, you know, were primitive, to say the least.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Also funny, on another footnote, yet another footnote.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Watching the European Championships, which are brilliant, and thoroughly enjoying them.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
But the ball, the modern ball, I think is a bit too light.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Oh yeah.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Balloon.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
But the old ball weighed a ton.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And I remember one game where Roy Keane was probably the grandfather of Keane.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
You know Keane?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Yes, sure, sure.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
He was full back, and Fisher was it, two Irish internationals.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And someone, I think it might have been Tommy Lawton, with a hell of a shot on him.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Hammered the ball towards goal, and Keane met it, and headed it to the halfway line.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And he turned, and it weighed, it was soaking wet.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And it must have weighed about four pounds.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000
He turned to his colleague and said, oh that hurt, it stiffened, and fell over backwards, completely unconscious.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
That's a nice story.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Oh, he's always wonderful.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I know with kids behind that goal, all cheering.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Hey, any of it?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Yeah.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Last question, you showed me your wallet about West Ham, like do you fancy West Ham as well?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Oh yeah, another story.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Serves you right.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:26.000
When I was a little boy, after the war, about 1946, I was 11, we started to play football in school again.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Because we didn't through the war.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And my mother, I was 13, I was in the technical college by this time.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I played before that.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And in the technical college, you had to have your own kit to play.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
If you were picked for the school team, well obviously.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It was very difficult to get kit, so my mother managed to get me a tight yellow jumper.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So we were playing in the trials, and they know this place, Ganges, the field, up in town here, playing trials for the school.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And one of the lads had a West Ham jersey, a proper West Ham jersey.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So he went in my, so we swapped jerseys.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Wow.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Now, the West Ham jersey, because I was only a little lad, probably came down there.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And I've been a West Ham supporter ever since.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
That's a nice story. Thank you. Thanks for sharing it.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
There we are.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Well, if you leave us a contact, like a telephone number or an email, we might contact you again.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It's my home number, which you know the code, 01792, isn't it?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000
893758, so that's my phone.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And my mobile is 07760.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.000
471230.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Take this to the chemist and we'll make it through.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Thank you very much.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
It's been a pleasure.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
It's been a pleasure for me.
