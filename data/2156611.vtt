00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
Today is Thursday June the 23rd. My name is Jill Willie and I'm here today speaking with

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.320
Roy Evans at his home in Ryder, home with an absolutely beautiful view. Well Roy, thanks

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.280
very much for agreeing to talk to me. First of all, can we start by just asking your year

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.240
of birth please?

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.240
1948.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.360
Right, that's fine. Okay, now you've lived and worked in Ryder all your life. Can you

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.080
start off with your early life, where you were born?

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.680
I was the first child to be born in Cai Glass when they were elected them as they were finishing

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:52.080
them. So I was born there in 1948 with my brothers, you know, and we had a happy time there. And

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.880
the whole row, there's loads of us children up there and we had some great fun like, isn't

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.880
it? Yeah.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.800
Were you able to play in the streets then? Was it safe to play on the road?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.000
Oh yes, there's, outside our house in Cai Glass we lived in number three. There was

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.440
a lamppost there and there was another one up by my uncle in number 11 Cai Glass. And

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.000
we found out in the winter, if we hit the lamppost with a big stone, we'd knock the

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
light off so we could play hide and seek. And then every Saturday morning, Mr Williams,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.720
who worked for the electricity board, would be coming up with his ladder to go up to put

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.240
the timer back on the clock or the lights. And we'd do the same thing again.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.440
And did he ever catch on?

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.600
No, no, I don't think so, no. When we were very young, one of the highlights Saturday

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.440
morning, Mr Williams, they'd come up, the bread men, two brothers in red at the time,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.640
he'd come up with his horse and cart with the bread. And the bread, he had a canvas

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.760
sheet on the back of the trailer and the bread was piping hot and mum always had a round

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.240
loaf with rings on it. So we'd take that in straight for mum and she'd cut the crust

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.520
off both ends, put butter on it for my brother and myself. That was one of the treats on

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.600
the Saturday.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.920
That was your reward for delivering the bread?

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920
Yes, yes.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920
Wonderful.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.840
And then do we add another man come up, Bimmy I think, the milkman, he used to come up a

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.080
glass with his milk flukes again, horse and cart. I can remember them, days well.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.360
Things have certainly changed.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.880
Oh, they have, yeah.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.760
You wouldn't expect to see that sort of delivery anymore.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.360
What other families lived in Kiglass near you?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:59.400
Number one was, her first husband died, so there were Joneses and Carraddocks then, and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.280
there was a family of ten between the two, two families. And then number two there was

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:17.720
Missy Sharp when I was younger. We were number three. And number four was Mr. Watkins, Margaret

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.640
Watkins, she was in the Beauty Queen contest and her father worked for the council and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.760
he was one of them. He used to go round with a bit of a truck with two bins on to sweep

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.720
the roads. And then next to him there was Jill Williams, his home, Quentin Davis, and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:48.120
he was a character. And the next one then to him was Tom Jones, Dai Jones is Auntie's

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.560
father, we call him Dai Spanner, and they had a sister as well. And the next lot to

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.600
him was Eddie Futcher and he was a character. Because he didn't carry glass at the time.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.800
We had massive gardens at the back because the road by the British Leeds, it was only

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.240
enough for one car, so you can imagine how big the gardens were. And Eddie was no gardener,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.960
so the council wrote to him to tell him to tidy his garden up. And he replied back to

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.680
him in the letter and said, when I applied for a council house, I expected a council

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:30.840
house, not a homestead. Which was just like him. The next lot to him was the Bowenzes,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.480
they were a very big family again. There was a big family of eight or nine there. And

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.760
then I don't know, there was another one, Bacchie Kinsley, he worked on the post but

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.400
he did cobbling as well. He had a little shop down there opposite the bay. And who was the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.800
next one? Oh it was the next one was Jane Arborer's house, she lived there with her

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.880
And then there was my uncle Bill was number 11, he was a bit of a character. And then

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.320
number 12 was the Murphy's. And I always remember when we were a lot younger, we used to call

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.360
other boys here at Green Gardens, and some of that were boys, they used to call them

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.840
the Bay Boys because they always went drinking in the bay. And you'll be guaranteed Saturday

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:26.880
night they start at number 12 and jump the hedges. And my father had a big privet hedge

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.240
with a peak on it. And in the morning a big big dense in it and the Bay Boys called it

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.840
Beeches Brook because nobody made it. So you know we had a lot of, we made our own fun

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.400
up there then, like isn't it? Not damaged nothing but just good fun, you'll have your

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.480
gates taken off the hinges and things like that. So we had a happy childhood there.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.480
Well he certainly did, we could almost write a book about Kiglass itself couldn't we?

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:04.720
Oh yes. Yes. Oh wonderful. And then school days Roy, which schools did you go to in this

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.360
town? Cuntida School, the other side there, but then Mrs Lloyd was headmistress and we

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:22.680
had to recite Cuntida, we used to say C W M D A U D D W R Cuntida. And my wife said

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.480
why couldn't you learn something like that even when you were in school all the time?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:35.040
And after that Raider School. That was a good time there, like isn't there? A wonderful

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.640
headmaster, I can't think what his name was now. Mr Price. Mr Price, he was a good headmaster.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.040
And then we went to the big school, Secondary Modern, which we thought was massive. We

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.920
had a lot of fun up there but I think the most that was in the school was ninety odd

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.520
then, you know we had a lot of fun and farm children came, most of them come to Brindale

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:05.080
School. We used to call the ones who went to Landrinders Grammar School county cabbage.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:14.800
Alright. And what are your memories of Bryn Tyrion? Did you enjoy sport there Roy? Oh

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.600
yes I loved sport, yeah it was good, good all round really, like I enjoyed it up there.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:28.520
Were you in the football team? Yes I played for Radisher Schools, Wynn Lloyd and myself

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:38.600
and Pinchy, yeah. We hardly won a game. Taking part that counts. And your school subjects

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.520
then, did you have any favourites? I quite like maths, I hope that's a spell in, I still

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.000
am a bit like isn't it, you know. My wife always says she thinks I was a little bit

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.440
dyslectic the way I used to pronounce things. She said of course today they pick it up,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:01.400
you know. No we had happy times eh. I didn't like being in the choir. Friday was choir

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.680
day or gardening so we all went gardening instead of being in the choir. And where did

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.600
you do the gardening Roy? Well they did start up, they used to be up where Ainsley Richards

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.760
lives now, up behind there. They started to dig some of the ground up. Now that I know

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.160
a bit about gardening nothing grew there much because there was trees everywhere and it

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:28.200
took everything out of the soil. And when we were in the garden digging it we used to

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.600
find bullets because the army were billeted up there during the war and they used to go

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:41.080
practising in the field behind. They were all dads most of them like isn't they. So

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.680
did you have a lot of time trying to find all these bullet holes? No it's just that

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.480
when we were digging the garden and we were picking them up like isn't it. Of course

00:08:52.480 --> 00:09:00.120
we didn't know if they were alive or dead then like isn't it. And another time we started

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:07.440
to be, it seems dull today but on a Friday afternoon we used to go up to where the car

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.320
park is now, that was part of the big old house then before it was pulled down. And

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.880
we started to dig down and clear the old cellar out which was there with stones and

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.320
we were tipping them in the wood because we were going to make a swimming pool there.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.120
So we were all up there every Friday for an hour for a long time doing it. And once we

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:34.720
dug it out after they built the one that was in the school then, the local people collected

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:42.120
the money for it. So they filled the cellar up after. And I think that was my training

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:50.040
for being in the building site lifting the stones up. Very good start. Good transition

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.640
from school into the building trade. So could we talk a little bit about that now, how it

00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:00.880
all started and where you worked in building trade. It was in the Red area wasn't it?

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:09.760
I started my time with Bernard Lloyd. In those days in school we didn't have what you call

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.360
a careers officer coming round much. My father said to me one day when I was ready to leave

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:22.440
school, I got you a job he said, he doesn't want any carpet but he could do with a mason

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:29.520
and that was my starting life. So he'd asked Bernard Lloyd, so I started with Bernard then.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.160
We never went to college then. Bernard said if you go to college you'll swallow the union

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.640
book. It can teach you more on site which you could like you know. And when I started

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.600
I was mixing cement because I was told how can you tell a labourer how to mix cement

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.120
if you can't do it yourself. That was the upbringing you know. And as I said King Morgan

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.200
was very good to me and Dick Mitten was very good. And the Carpenter's were very good,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.520
they were very skilled carpenters. John Lloyd, Bill Johnson and of course Derek Cadwallagh,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:08.600
Ralph Oakley they were all good tradesmen then. And Bernard Lloyd now, did he have his

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.680
own building firm? Because I think he took on a lot of apprentices. Yeah Bernard he was

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.960
the main builder in town here. The only other builder at the time was Tom Morgan and Tom

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.720
only had his brother Idris and two other boys but Bernard had the majority. I think there

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:34.720
was 20 working for Bernard when I started. And where did you work? I believe you mentioned

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:41.240
the Therrow estate. We used to go up there patching the barns up round town putting slates

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:49.440
and rows all manner of little jobs like wasn't it you know. You'd be pushing it up a street

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.200
with a wheelbarrow or a truck with a ladder on. And my friend Dick was telling me one

00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:00.600
day, Dick I learnt my apprenticeship with, the bloke laboring for him then was called

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:07.480
Evan, this was Jill Williams' grandfather. And Dick would say we'd be pushing the wheelbarrow

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:13.440
up by the police station pitch. And he used to say to Dick, take over, this was half past

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.400
seven quarter to eight in the morning, take over Yonge. And he said, so Dick could get

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.080
the wheelbarrow to go on, Evan would go in behind the back of the Coombe tither arms

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.200
coming out wiping his face and he said, that feels better. He'd been in for a pint that

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:38.200
time of the morning. And when they were never without a good bucket because in those days

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.400
the ashes were put in buckets put outside the houses because they were hot. If we had

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.680
a hole in our bucket they'd tip the ashes into the bucket with a hole and take the good

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:56.240
bucket. They had it all worked out by the sounds of things, my word. And you've been

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:03.440
in the building trade all your working life then? Yes, yes. Of particular interest is

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:10.160
the bread oven I believe, Dick Mitten of whom you've been speaking, told you a little bit

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.960
about this and how to construct one. Could you give me any info on that? I haven't built

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.120
the bread oven myself but I think Dick might have done one and he was telling me what they

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:28.000
used to do. He said, I think you had roughly a two foot diameter hole, ring I should say,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.680
and then you put a brick upright which is nine inches and then a brick on top which

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:40.200
made it 13 inches and you go round like that and build the bread oven door in. And when

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:48.080
that's set you filled it all up with sand and you mounted the top like an oval shape

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.720
and then you bricked over the top of it and when that's set it was all done in line more

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:58.440
to them but the joints were very very tight because they didn't want the fire to break

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.840
it up. And once that's set you open the bread oven door and pull the sand out so it was

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.840
still formed all then as a little place like in there. They used to put all the all the

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:16.120
bracken and sticks in the fire, get it all warm and then pull it out so the fire bricks

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:22.520
were warm and then you can just push the bread in. And would these be used in commercial

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:33.680
bakeries or? No, mostly in old farm houses, things like that. Where my brother lives now,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.160
I did some work up there, repaired some work and there was a massive bread oven up there

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:45.120
that was a very big one and that did the baking for the estate for the whole area. And where is

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:52.080
that? That's up in Llandinan. And I think we did some work years and years ago for Elwyn at the

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:59.600
Lyon Hotel. Elwyn asked Dick was there a do you think there's a fire grate, an old-fashioned fire

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.960
grate? And Dick said well yes, he said if it's an eight foot opening and about that four foot

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:12.080
return it's surely a big grate. So Elwyn and William, they had I don't know how many tonnes

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:18.720
of stone out from there and we we did it up the oak beam and all but in the corner if I

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.120
I haven't been in there for years now in the corner there's a baking oven and I'm sure that's one is

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:31.280
dead out of stone and you don't often see a baked bread oven dead out of stone but see the lion is

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:38.000
that old I suppose he didn't have fire bricks in them days you know so I'm gonna go one day into

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.360
the lion to see was I right was it a stone one I think back of my mind it was like you know.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.600
Can you tell me exactly where the lion is in in Raerder Roy? It's

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.600
um

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:58.560
great opposite Crompton's Pet Shop either lay and royal with a big arch you go in on the back

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.160
it's a very old hotel yeah yeah a very old hotel I believe well to your credit Roy you built a very

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:16.960
beautiful home here with the most wonderful view um how long did it take you to build your your house

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:25.520
all told it took me four years I did so much up to the winter that I left it and then it was um

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:34.400
Saturday and Sunday till dinner and so I did it that way so it paid off and it certainly has and

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:42.880
you really have got a lovely what annoyed me after I spent four years building it and because it's

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:50.160
the value of it has gone up I'm penalized with council tax because I've I've gone up a band

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:58.160
you know they don't take into account how hard you worked to do a job like I said you know. All

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:04.800
credit to your expertise but um it's gone against you a bit there but never mind you still you've

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:11.600
still got this this lovely view all right well look thank thank you very very much Roy it's been

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.640
the most interesting talk it really has. Do you want to see a photograph of the peak?

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:23.840
Have you seen them? Oh before we finish yes we'd better talk about the peak hadn't we and um your

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:29.280
contribution to the new peak yes I'd like to see the photograph but could you tell us a bit about

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:37.280
the well the peak it was all done just mounds of stone where people have been climbing up it and

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:43.440
it kept falling down and David Evans David Lloyd who was the mayor of course David's passed away

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:51.280
many years ago they did a mayor's project and he approached Dick about rebuilding it and Dick was

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:58.640
the main man behind it all and a gang of men went up a couple of days before and pulled it down

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:07.040
and Dick made a template to build the peak he had one of these uprights he used to have on the

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:13.920
old big H television aerials and he fixed a piece of hardwood on the top about two foot six

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:21.920
diameter or two foot diameter the top made loads of holes in it and he went up two days before fixed

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:29.040
it up cemented in this place then we put string then through these holes all the way down to shape

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.480
the radius of and tapered of the actual stonework so all we have to do then is follow the lines to

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:43.520
go on up and I think there's about 20 the three of us doing the building Dick Mitten Les Farme

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:51.520
and myself and there's about 20 people up this Sunday mixing the cement and we thought we'd be

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.760
back in town before the pub shut on a Sunday at two o'clock they used to and we ran out of cement

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:03.040
so we were late coming down and the pubs were shut and you were looking forward to a drink

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:09.600
and there was a time capsule built in there and and when was this what year roughly was this

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:21.520
oh what decade perhaps I think I was 27 now and I'll get if I get your photograph the date is on it

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:28.000
all right yes that that that would be lovely yes super super

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.320
well thank you for getting the photographs Roy we've established now of course that

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:47.840
it was 1977 the um I suppose that'll be the Queen's silver jubilee am I right yeah

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:58.240
yeah there's a television pipe the pipe at the top of the peak and then we had this thing going

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.960
round and we put lines all the way down we just had to keep following it round and round and round

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:10.320
till we got to the top all right so that's how how you built it yes and the um the peak as we call it

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:16.160
of course that's a very prominent landmark yes um on the top of guastedin are I correct yes the

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.480
mountain overlooking and there's a lovely photograph here of all the local people

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:27.600
mainly farmers who were involved in that can in in that construction absolutely lovely um

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:35.200
now you you mentioned your father that he'd worked on the corporation up in the the eland valley not

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:42.000
far from here uh can can you tell me what he did and one special garment that you kept from him

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.640
well he worked he ended up a general foreman up there but they worked on the filter beds and

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:54.480
and there was about 40 in their gang then like they used to filter the water from one bed to

00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.960
the other and so on but today it's left goes all the way down the pipes to to Birmingham now to

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.480
Franklin like isn't it but in the end days the water was clean when it left here but because

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:12.560
there were so many seepages into the pipe track it had to be filtered the other end so they

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.200
they more or less did away with a lot of it up there then he was up there for many years

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:26.640
yeah I see and he was originally from where Roy Pantador he was born and then he came down

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.760
to live in raider then rest of your life Pantador being a little village about three or four months

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:38.400
away is that correct yes on the way to family advice oh I see now I believe you contributed

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.360
something rather important to Carrod the donkey jacket could you could you tell us a little bit

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.880
about that well they were issued with these white coats we called them donkey jackets why I don't

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:58.640
know they could uh it was part of the issue for work and um it was a very funny the backs of them

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.560
sort of came in oval shape and on a wet day the blokes used to pin it up so it acted instead of

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:10.480
the water and drip it off down your legs it acted like a little truffet they turn it up and put a

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.400
pin in it so so the water would drop off the back of their coats better like isn't there very good

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:25.280
design yeah and then there was a some of the olden says that there was a helicopter something going

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.800
on in Valley and a fella said what's all the other all them sheep down on the hill and they said oh

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.760
it's in shape as Birmingham Corporation workers because they were real white they were these coats

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:42.240
so I I was in my garage for years it was sentimental value so I give to Carrod because

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:49.440
I wouldn't want it like isn't it yeah well at least people can see it and have a glimpse into how

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:57.680
people were yes well right what changes have you seen in red particularly with regard to the way

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:04.720
industry has gone I know there's quite a few in industry that's come and gone in this in the estate

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:12.000
isn't there yes well when I was I can remember the factory at Brunavon factory my sister and my

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.040
brother worked there for a while they were making sun visors for the car industry then that closed

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:23.040
and then Ray Hicks very play to me started compact that autumn of years wasn't it and then

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.160
they were taken over they had two shifts down there people from Birmingham came to work here

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:35.200
then and there was about 50 odd people working there apparently and then we had priest jacksons

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:44.960
that was a big outfit again and then we had uh what did they make um right priest bolts and

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.720
things like that you know and was that down on the brim berth yes yeah industry it's uh far um

00:23:51.280 --> 00:24:00.800
it's next to radar rbs now but it it's like a um oh food place now I know we got two but

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.080
that's rbs it philip pew added and it was like farm food and stuff to start with yeah

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.840
and then the other side the brook they weren't there then when we were small

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:18.240
what we called the glass factory but that's still there but it didn't operating like it used to you

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:25.200
know the thing that things have changed yes perhaps attitudes have had as well and you

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.960
were mentioning something about the motto that um was it dick mitten said or king all king morgan

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.400
he said to me his advice he gave to you yeah when i started the first week at work he said

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:43.760
roi three things to remember on the building site life limb and property and always think of the

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:49.600
man coming behind you what he meant by that is do your work tidy so it's right for the carpenter

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:56.560
and stuff after but today they've come and gone those days are gone it's number one now look after

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:03.520
number one but he was he was very very good that's a very wise words i'm sure which probably stuck

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:10.560
with you yeah oh it always stuck with you all your life yeah yes yes and he is a character he

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:16.560
always told me to um he i said he came out one day he was always drinking a lot of water

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:23.520
and i remember him telling me don't you drink much water water i said not a great deal okay boy

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:29.840
well look here he said what you do when you go to the toilet he well you go do what you want and

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:37.360
he flushed flush the toilet and he said that's what i drink water for it's my way of flushing me out

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:43.520
and they should all do it he said again more wise words yes yes and i mean they're going back 50

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.160
years now and i used to think well what is he on about well when you think back he was quite right

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:55.440
you know absolutely yes we make a big thing of that now don't we not being high dehydrated

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:01.440
fine so on the whole you've had a very happy life really very interesting oh yes i would never go

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:11.440
from raider never no but we're saying like the likes of emras and them fellas like we were always

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.880
called if you're born and bred in raider he was a boogie boy because that's that's where you've been

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.920
born but now there's not many of us left now brian poor old brian lauras always used to say there's

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:29.200
not many of us boogie boys left now who were born and bred here you know some people have been here

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:34.480
perhaps for five or six years but it's not the same as being born here that's right and the boogie

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:39.200
why why why do you call it the boogie well it starts up by brinterian school doesn't it the

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:46.320
boogie i think yeah and somebody brian used to say if you if you padlo went in the boogie you're here

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.200
for life or something he used to say because that used to go all the way through town didn't it you

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:56.720
know am i right in thinking they they put it underground but it's still there somewhere it's

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.240
at the opposite the lodge in brinterian school it's been piped up but there was a pond there

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:09.760
and that's where it started it went across the road down the brook by dr evan says and then

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.320
where you go into my scene and there was another big pool on the side of the road there

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:20.560
then they went down north street west street and then down to the river and it's all piped after

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.760
so it goes into the river wide as it river wide eventually yes yeah so they tell us all like

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:39.760
but we can't see any of it now we take it no no no the the pond by the up by brinterian like

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.600
we used to go there you see frog spawns and stuff and all that that in there but

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.480
it's all it's hardly anything there now because it's been piped

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:54.720
hmm well one of the changes are rarer but the the legacy lives on where we people

00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:01.760
yeah that's right yeah well i think we've covered most things now haven't we but i'm so glad i've

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.160
seen these lovely pictures and you were showing me some of school as well which brings back a lot

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:13.200
of memories for you yeah yes lovely right well thank you thank you very much for your time and

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:20.160
i i hope it's a help well absolutely yes any of these memories of bygone days certainly are when

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.920
they're dealing with them and there's always a link isn't there somehow with the eland valley

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.680
it's yeah another thing we used to do when we were young we used to go up to the station catch the

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:38.000
train and go as far as martick to go whimpering that was a big thing we'd be all up in the hill

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.960
picking whimperies yeah then the railway of course is no more no it's a shame really

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.640
yeah so martick which direction would that be in that up the lingering road

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:58.320
yeah yeah am i right in thinking that sometimes people used to sell the whimperies they'd pick to

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.040
the people on the trains yeah used to go and pick whimperies come back to town there yeah

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.760
we'd be up there all afternoon picking whimperies yeah

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.880
yeah it's very sad to see the railway go and it'd be a godsend to david or still there wouldn't it

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:19.920
i would think yes you never know see what happens in the future yeah yeah

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.520
all right well thank you thank you very very much roy thank you for your time thank you
