00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
And then it must have been February or March.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:17.760
The Czech government in exile came from France, established itself here.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:30.760
And with the Czech army there came about 50 soldiers who were in the same position as I was,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.760
that they had not quite finished their medical studies but had done the clinical years.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:46.760
So it was arranged that they and I could finish their studies here.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.760
So we were all put into various universities.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:03.760
And then came the queer situations that what kind of degree to give us.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.760
This degree had to be valuable also in Czechoslovakia because everybody wanted to go back

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.760
and didn't want to do any examinations again.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:24.760
What happened was that Oxford University adopted the Prague University which was closed.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.760
So I got this diploma in Oxford in a great kind of glory.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.760
It was called MD Czechoslovakia.
