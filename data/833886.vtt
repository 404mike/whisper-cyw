00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.360
Well, I live in your studio.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:31.680
It is my uncle, D.A. Williams, who probably heard of, referred to, what he brought Joseph

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.680
Herman to Austria-Germany.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.680
And when Herman first came here, he stayed with him in the cottage in Audfell Street.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.680
And it was from there that he took the fancy to the world of Austria-Germany.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.680
So he was my mother's brother.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.680
My uncle then became the, eventually over many years, owned the studio and added the

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.680
studio to his home.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.680
When he came, it was 1945, then he was about 18 months in the Pennabonk den.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.680
He stayed about three weeks with my uncle in this little cottage, coming at first for

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.680
just a few weeks holiday.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.680
But he took a fancy to the people that he'd met when they went pubbing or met people in

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.680
the street.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.680
Everybody seemed friendly.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.680
So I'm told, and so he thought he would stay a little longer.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.680
And he then went to the Pennabonk inn, where they'd been for a drink, and stayed in a

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.680
rented, what we call the ballroom, other times called the ballroom, a large room.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.680
Nothing has ever been a ballroom in a pub, very top floor.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.680
And he stayed there for a few, I think about a year.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.680
He saw this place, the studio, we now call it the studio, but it wasn't called the studio

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.680
then, looking out of the window of the Pennabonk, the side window, he saw it amongst the weeds.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.680
I think he bought it from the Gulf Estate.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.680
It was, it was at the time some sort of storage.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.680
I don't know quite who would use it as storage, but it was some sort of storage, wartime

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.680
storage, but foodstuff.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.680
And before that it had been a pub for like three years.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.680
You were to tell me earlier on about the different renovations that you've done to the property.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.680
Can you go through how much this building has changed since Joseph found it?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:13.680
Well Joseph changed it a bit because he added an extension to the pop factory rooms where

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.680
he would have had his studio, he had his studio.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:29.680
And then the extension was a further room at the back, bedroom upstairs, and a bathroom

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.680
at the showroom downstairs.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.680
So he would have added the extension.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.680
As time went by, I went to both the building, he then changed things like putting different

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.680
flooring, the flooring and the extension, and putting the staircase that was an adivine

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.680
before.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:04:00.680
So over the years then we have arrived, the walls were substandard and therefore had to

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.680
be, I couldn't support the roof so we did lots of replaced windows and things like that.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.680
Really, just the size of the studio room.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.680
And that's where we're sitting now.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.680
Which I did really regret but we didn't have a fortune at the time.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.680
Not now either.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.680
We never liked it at all.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.680
But it was such an interesting building.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.680
It was interesting during my uncle's time actually because he added some finer points,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:42.680
you know, what I am, suspended ceilings and documented a little bit.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.680
I was always regretted not having a character.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.680
And we saw villages of the Rortyne staircase.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.680
Really, it was there before but the Rortyne wasn't there before.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.680
It was for Herman to store his canvases in a loft.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.680
So sorry.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.680
You see the building is almost in two, isn't it?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.680
Two parts to it.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.680
Yes, really.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.680
Can you describe the building today?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.680
Well, it's more of a conventional dwelling than it was in the past.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.680
Unfortunately, it is more of a conventional dwelling.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.680
How did you actually meet Joseph?

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.680
Well, I met him obviously through my family, my auntie.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.680
But that's really when I met him in North Fuller Street.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:49.680
But I was only ten years of age so I was not so taken much, what is it, this strange couple.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.680
Strange, unusual.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.680
That's what I like to call them.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.680
And that their accents were different.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.680
Joseph's aunt, Katrice, his wife.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.680
What was your, if you can remember really, what was your image of them before when you did meet them?

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.680
You mentioned that they were strange.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.680
I was a pretty busy little girl.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.680
I was always, not staying for very long.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.680
I can't recall telling my mum how they were strange.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.680
And that they were dramatic clocks.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.680
I remember the dramatic long black clocks.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.680
In fact, they must have made quite an impact because I still love a clock.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.680
Yes, I think they impact their confidence.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.680
They were different, they were very different.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.680
Not so much confidence, I don't know.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.680
But certainly they were communicative.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.680
Made an effort to communicate.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.680
Even with awkward ten year olds.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.680
Interested in that, interested in everything.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.680
Did your relationship change over time?

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.680
Yes, when you're an adolescent you don't get much time when you talk about yourself.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.680
I remember meeting them in a cinema.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.680
We had a cinema.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:31.680
And they would sit, there were chelins in the front stalls.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.680
Where all the young children sat and were very noisy.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.680
And then there were running nines, there were running sixes at the back.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.680
And the running nines upstairs in the back.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.680
You can tell a long story.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.680
And I always, I can't understand why Joel and Katra always sit in the chelins of the children.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.680
So they stood up because they were not afraid to be different.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:09.680
Thinking about it now, they were not going to be who they were going to be in the conventions or whatever.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.680
I felt that was a freedom about them.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.680
Can you describe, if we look at more us again lights now,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.680
can you describe us again like in Joseph's day?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.680
Oh dear.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.680
The mines were tight.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.680
My father was a farmer.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.680
Many people have heard about miners.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:48.680
I lived very close to the dead on a farm.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.680
Evacuees, I can't remember, this is the end of the time that you had evacuees.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.680
I obviously remember it as a very happy, very happy day.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.680
An interesting day, an interesting, very happy day.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.680
But Katra was also a farmer as well.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.680
In the village, in the miners.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.680
Do you think, did this again change when Joseph arrived?

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.680
I think that's a pretty dramatic statement.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.680
I don't know if it changed or not much.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:43.680
Perhaps having heard what my family say, what my marital answer,

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.680
that answer is something that I tried to emulate and not all that successfully,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.680
that like-minded people came together.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:58.680
So there was an interest in the, not so much in the visual arts,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.680
but there was an interest, there were interest in discussion groups.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.680
So looking back, I think, my family would be involved and would be going to discussion groups

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:20.680
and would be interested in the news and interested in what's going on in current affairs, in literature.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.680
And I know, I can remember, would provoke a lot of laughter.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.680
They had a book reading club, of course it wasn't a club,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.680
it was just coming together, Mr. George, I was in that, and he'd take us home.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:40.680
Where they read us classics and it would perhaps be called a prejudice or something.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.680
And they would all wait for George to read.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:52.680
They would all be actually hysterical because George would read in this Polish Jewish accent, you know.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:11:00.680
So they were, this is something I'm dying to emulate, but I can, they were interested in lots of things.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:10.680
They were not narrow-minded or, I don't know, it is fine to, it's like you've got minds.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:17.680
And they were stimulating people when they were interested in things.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:29.680
And I thought we actually lost that when I think of the last, I don't know, when I over dramatized time.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.680
So do you think that was lost when Joseph left?

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:44.680
No, I don't think it was actually, maybe he'd been a catalyst in some way because he had something of what to offer.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:52.680
And I don't think up to that point perhaps some, you know, people may not have heard of Todd Starr or Bozak.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:58.680
So perhaps he stretched, stretched them a little bit.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.680
But as they also stretched him, so he did describe him.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:10.680
He introduced him also to radical child, you know.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:18.680
Because he was very curious. I remember there being very, very curious people here in the country.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:27.680
She wanted to, I wonder if she wanted to come to a funeral, she wanted to go to a Welsh chapel and do a funeral service.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.680
And she came to the farm and she came in a red dress.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.680
And my mother was mortified. She came in a red dress.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.680
So my mother had a coat she thought an awful lot about, so it was an Astrakhan coat.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.680
So she lent her the Astrakhan coat and put over the red dress to go to the funeral.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.680
Did they have any political influence in the area?

00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:01.680
I think they came together, again, just me, I think they came together because of a political interest.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.680
I think that's what introduced everyone, was we brought them together.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:14.680
I think that they came, my uncle and I went to meet them in Brecon, they went on holiday in Brecon,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.680
because of the Contest in the Communist Party.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.680
So, that again was the start.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:29.680
They were very, very politically aware.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.680
But as many as, well anyway.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.680
Did they get involved with the government?

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.680
I think so, yeah.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:51.680
I think they certainly got involved with discussion groups, or the event at the Beverly Hall of plays.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.680
Yes.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:03.680
And again, looking maybe at Joseph's work, do you think he captured the spirits of this again, wife?

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.680
Of the people in the industry of the area.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.680
Yes, sometimes I think so, he's sombre.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:18.680
But I just love his work, I mean, sombre or not.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.680
He's got a drawing there, I think that's of my aunt.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.680
And she was so thankful I saved it, my aunt, I just love it so much.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:37.680
She was mentally handicapped, and she was on the file, and I think that really captures the spirit.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.680
I think that really captures it.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.680
But it's sad in a way as well.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.680
But to me, of course, obviously, I see it as a sadness.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.680
It's a lady who was in...

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.680
He says in this interview that he says something in this interview,

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.680
and that happened to me quite recently, it was still a joke.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.680
And it was called the 6th of October, 1945.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:12.680
It is maybe clarity from the speakers, my aunt, Joseph Herman, and the history of Williams.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:18.680
And the 12th of October was transmitted Pacific service.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.680
Pacific service, what?

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.680
What he says about...

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:36.680
What he says about Ashwagandhas and why he came.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.680
It says here, yes, I came here from London, but more interesting are the reasons why I came.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.680
For quite a long time I had wanted to draw and paint Maynard.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:52.680
But I couldn't make up my mind which place to choose.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.680
This is the reason he came to Ashwagandhas.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:01.680
But the bombardment of London destroyed the hospital which my wife was attending for treatment at the time,

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.680
and I was forced to make up my mind quickly.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.680
A friend gave me the address of a hospital in this district, and so we came down here to Bethlehem.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.680
Originally it was only for a month, but it was a really steep climb.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:23.680
It wasn't the Maynard he says that really attracted him first, but it was the actual surroundings.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:33.680
He found that compared with other Maynard localities in Belgium, particularly the first two,

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.680
that there was no colour.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.680
There was colour in the building, there was colour in the stone.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.680
He still got it in the summer.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.680
It's coming everywhere in November.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.680
It didn't come until the great rains, and the sun was shining.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.680
You could see the colour in the building.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:17:04.680
So he says that he long wanted to get Maynard, but was attracted in the rest of the structure, the location itself.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:10.680
And do you believe that he captured this in the Maynard?

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:16.680
Yes, yes I do. Not the colour.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.680
Actually not the colour.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.680
I think he captured something.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.680
I love his figures.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:32.680
I have found them very sombre, with those two women gossiping there.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.680
They're so...

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.680
I can't forget.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.680
We call them a material in the sense that they...

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.680
You know what they are, and you can almost join in their conversation.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.680
I feel I know what they're talking about.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:57.680
The dramatic and bold. I love their boldness.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:04.680
And if you look at that painting as well, that drawing, they look at you.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.680
I think he looks...

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:15.680
He looks sad and sombre and dignified.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.680
Yes, it is the dignity of the Maynard.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:30.680
Did you ever meet the Boomsbury set, the group he came around with?

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:36.680
I saw lots of people, but I wouldn't have known at the time where they were.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.680
Lots of people really, and I did still join.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.680
I wasn't cheered on that often, really.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:49.680
As an adolescent, you've got many other things to pursue.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:19:00.680
To give people that didn't meet Joseph Hellman the understanding of who he was

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.680
and what he meant to the people in this degree.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:10.680
Is there any particular story that comes to mind, any kind of antidote?

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:21.680
I actually use his own work, his own words.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:26.680
It's very complimentary, but it talks about his colour.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.680
It also talks about how friendly the people were.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.680
You're no stranger here, and called him Joe Bach affectionately.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.680
He was known as Joe Bach.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.680
I always start off with saying that he thought...

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.680
He was a very famous man, very famous artist.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:54.680
He thought so much of us together was a special dream, and he used his own words.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.680
Do you have a general feeling of other people in the area about Joseph?

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.680
At a certain age.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:11.680
I remember him for his eccentricities, I think, of dress.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:21.680
They used to call this place the Pink House, because it was obviously a pale tenacotter.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.680
You're sure that your painting has a pale tenacotter.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.680
So in the 40s.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.680
Especially in the Breshoff Halles.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.680
People asked me, oh, you're living in the Pink House.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.680
So I don't know if there's someone else who said, my mother used to wash the sheets.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:49.680
Have you interviewed her?

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.680
Betty Hawking.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.680
Oh, Betty Davis.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.680
She said that they had red sheets.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.680
So they were not afraid of different people.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.680
People seemed to have a lot of affection for people.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:19.680
Do you think they were a bit reluctant at first, when they first came here, a little bit?

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.680
At the time, no.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.680
Perhaps it's because perhaps they were invited here in the first instance.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.680
Invited here.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.680
And they knew that the mining community was very strong.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:42.680
And they were invited here by members of the mining community, by people who played prominent roles.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:50.680
There was a passport, wasn't it, and having a very welcoming time.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:58.680
I think there must have been some influence.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.680
Because I also like the Breshoff Halles.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.680
But he has the talent.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.680
I like the Breshoff Halles.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:14.680
So, wouldn't I, if it hadn't been for them, I don't know, really.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.680
I think there must have been tremendous influence.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.680
Because I was extremely proud of them, proud of my husband and my husband.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.680
Because they were different.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:32.680
And when they were young, they were very different.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.680
It seemed to be glamour, it wasn't glamour.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.680
But I mean, it seemed to be different and they had a glamourous, I think it was a little bit of a mess.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.680
And then there were books, although...

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.680
I had a lot of books as well.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:55.680
But I needed to inherit any.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.680
So, so many.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:05.680
So, if he indeed influenced them, then certainly they influenced me.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.680
Obviously they influenced me politically.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.680
So they influenced me specifically.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.680
Okay, now I can see it.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.680
Yes?

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.680
Psychology, sociology, literature.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.680
They were very...

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:31.680
I mean, would that person think that the miners would not normally be into it all?

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.680
He?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.680
No, no.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.680
Right.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.680
I think they would have been motivated by the...

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.680
Politically motivated anyway.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.680
Before he came, politically motivated.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.680
And it happened about the same time that we did...

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.680
The Silent Village was filmed here.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.680
It was...

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.680
Have you heard of Silent Village?

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.680
Silent Village, what is that?

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.680
I don't know whether I begin to tell you about that.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:07.680
This is what this interview with Tarvan Davis is actually all about.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.680
It's that...

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:19.680
And my uncle, I think he was the chairman of some lodges at the time.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.680
And he talks about...

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.680
Tarvan Davis talks about really...

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.680
He says on the radio that you will have seen Kungier,

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.680
which is the village of Kungier, which is part of the Strickland.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.680
You will have seen it.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.680
The picturesque village of Kungier, he describes it.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.680
But...

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.680
And it comes as a small rural appendage, which is supposed to be, but it is.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.680
I was rigged on this.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.680
Just rows of cottages and small houses.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.680
Kungier is famous.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680
And it's false papers.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:57.680
Probably many of the listeners at the moment have seen it.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.680
Yes, you may have seen it.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.680
Not under its own name, of course, but representing another village,

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.680
the name of which really resounded throughout the world not so very long ago,

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.680
the village of Lydysing in Czechoslovakia,

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:16.680
where one of the most ruthless of Nazi crimes of the whole world took place.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:22.680
Well, did you see anything here in the Strickland nice that the film depicting,

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.680
you know, the undying village of the people of Lydysing

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.680
and what the Nazis did to them was actually made?

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:35.680
And that's what this interview is really about.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:44.680
Why did they come to a Strickland nice where the director was Humphrey Jennings,

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.680
the famous director now, so to say, of documentaries in particular?

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.680
So my son tells me.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.680
And my auntie says that he was notified by the miners' head office in Cardiff

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:03.680
saying that Humphrey Jennings or the crown filming was coming down to see them

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.680
because he was looking for a location to film the tragedy of Lydysing.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:14.680
And I suppose my auntie's job was to look for, to get in touch with the Czech delegation in London

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:21.680
to give them detailed information about villages around here that met standards in Lydysing.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:28.680
And Jennings came here and he liked us from here and liked the miners

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.680
and he filmed the southern villages.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:38.680
In fact, he had said that one of the things that Strickland was becoming part of the political side of things,

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:46.680
that Strickland was supposed to be, was a communist, if anyone remembers, strong communist party here.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:55.680
But links to the chapel in the communist party, so that you found that deacons in the chapel,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:01.680
no, not capitals, no, performance chapels, were also members of the communist party, unopened here.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:07.680
And you found that fascinating, unexpected.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.680
So I think it is politics.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:20.680
Maybe that's influenced me throughout my life too because I've spent a lifetime in the Labour Party at least.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:27.680
Oh my gosh. I'm the thing about you now, I'm the thing about you.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:40.680
I'm just thinking when Joseph moved back to London and left the studio, your uncle and auntie acquired the building,

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.680
did they buy building of Joseph?

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:52.680
Well, yes, according to my aunt and auntie, they bought it from, not from Joseph, but from Catria.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.680
It was Catria and two were parted by them.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.680
There were both of them living in London, living in different places in London.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:09.680
He was living, I think, in the Edith Roadhouse in Fulham and she was, I think she had a flat.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.680
You had a park or something.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.680
And you mentioned that your uncle and auntie owned a farm before that.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.680
You know, I lived in a farm, it was like Ben's place.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:30.680
And the breakers were ready, but I can't be doing the makes.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.680
Do you know why they wanted to buy this building?

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.680
They were, they were now in London.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.680
They were very sentimental, I think they wanted a home in Stoke-Ellis anyway.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:51.680
I think that the home, they were very happy here, their friendship with, friendship with John.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.680
Very, very happy, this is very exciting times for them.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:01.680
I should have mentioned that they had some wonderful associations with the building.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.680
I know that my uncle did that when we came at weekends and holidays,

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.680
we were always pottering and doing things.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.680
He did the staircase there and he would try your place and he did lots of things himself.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.680
He made the clothes.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.680
And that was like...

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:22.680
And it required more of a garden, so the garden we were drawing by buying house opposite.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:29.680
And the gardens are in front, so it required a piece to go so that there's land around.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.680
Or a three-site.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:38.680
So, yes, I think they became very sentimental about it.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.680
And they renamed it the studio.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.680
It was called Tatcha.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.680
I want to call it a factory pop.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.680
But we listened to it.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.680
And how did you feel when you acquired this building?

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.680
I inherited it.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:06.680
So one of six, four were of my immediate family, including me.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.680
And we bought the other two out of cousins.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:18.680
I was very happy to have it because I spent many, many happy years visiting the place

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.680
during my aunt and auntie's lifetime.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.680
Especially in the last ten years with my aunt before she died.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:34.680
And in fact we used to call the place the Clemling because, you know...

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.680
And we should have called it something else because we're men.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.680
We're men.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.680
We live in Farty.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.680
We all come over here.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.680
But the world's too right to the glass of wine.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.680
My bottle's of wine to fill it.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.680
So we were wonderful times here.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.680
I've locked his things, you know.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.680
May it continue.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.680
Yes.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:05.680
I stopped in the armadillo and said, Joe, have you seen Peggy and Dave or something like that?

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.680
He looked at you.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.680
That is because perhaps he was an artist.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.680
He really looked.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.680
You could see him looking.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.680
Yes.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.680
That's one thing to remember, isn't it?

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.680
Because it is dead things.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.680
Observing.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.680
I've never noticed anyone else, but that.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.680
Closely observing everything.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.680
