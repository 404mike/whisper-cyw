00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
I'm Lickie MacDonald and I'm in Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, at the Longest Yard

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.440
and I'm going to speak to David Gosling.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.400
And he's going to tell us about his father during the war.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.920
Thank you, David.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.800
Okay, yeah, my father, Peter Gosling, at the outbreak of war, he was too young to enlist,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.560
so he was in the Home Guard in Essex with his father.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.600
However, as soon as he was old enough, he enlisted.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.120
He went to the recruitment station and he went through

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.000
and he was actually at the time working as a ticket clerk for the London North Eastern Railway at Colchester.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.480
And so the recruiting people took one look at where he worked and put him in the engineers

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.640
and sent him to India to build a railway, even though he was a ticket clerk.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.000
At the age of 20 in India and Burma, he reached the rank of Warrant Officer 2, which is quite high,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.840
and he was put in charge of the second largest port in India.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.880
There was then an occurrence where a battalion got caught behind Japanese lines

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.800
and contracted dysentery, so they actually became ineffective.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.040
And the army looked for volunteers to go in on a boat up the river behind line to pick them up.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.400
My dad volunteered and although he'd never been in charge of a boat in his life,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.360
they made him the commander and he went downriver in the depths of night.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.280
They rescued the battalion, they brought them out, and they did not lose a single man.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.200
For that he was mentioned in dispatches.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.600
That's a wonderful story. So he survived the war?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.760
Yes, he survived the war. And it's one of those things when he was demobbed as a W.O.2,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.840
but was instantly offered a commission, but he turned it down.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.800
And he went and had a very, very good career in industry.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.080
He rose to be the managing director of a very large national company.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.680
But even to the end of his life, he always said he wondered what would have happened

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.640
had he taken the other path because he really, really loved the army.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.520
So he might have stayed in the army?

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.880
Yeah, he was very tempted, yeah.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.840
Yes. So he had an amazing walk career. Lovely that he was mentioned in dispatches.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.600
So have you got his medals?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.360
Yes, we have his medals and we take them to remember Sunday if we can

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.040
because I can wear them on the other breast.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.200
And we've got details of his entry in the London Gazette.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.360
It was typical of my father when he said that when he told the story,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.960
which he didn't tell for many, many years,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.880
and he said that technically he was behind enemy lines.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.880
Well, if you're in India and Burma with the Japanese,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.880
I don't think there's anything technical about it. You were.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.200
So yeah, he was very unassuming about it, as I think most people were.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.960
He sounds extraordinarily brave.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.080
Yeah, and he said they were, I don't think there was a shot fired either.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.280
They got in and got out without anybody noticing.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.400
And they rescued all of them?

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.120
Every single one.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.760
That is an amazing story, isn't it?

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.000
And he didn't tell it for most of his life?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.320
Yeah.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.120
Quite about it.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.160
And in the end, he really only talked about it because his granddaughter

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.840
was doing a project for work, for school, and he wrote it all down.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.880
And that's where we found it.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.640
At least it's been written down.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.800
Yeah.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.320
You've kept that and maybe give it to some other...

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.560
I've sent copies of it to the Royal Engineers Museum.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.920
Well, thank you very much indeed for that lovely and interesting story about your father.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.440
And I'm glad he survived it.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.200
He lived to 94, so...

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.320
Didn't do him any harm.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.280
You may not have thought that at the time, but thank you very much indeed.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.760
Thank you.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.800
Thank you so much.
