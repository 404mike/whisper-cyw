00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.760
My name is Steve Fletcher, I'm the Artistic Director of Swickr Carnival. I'm also the

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.480
founder of Cardiff Carnival, which is going to be enjoying in a very few short minutes

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:28.000
its 25th anniversary parade. We're just lining up and we have over 600 costumes and parading

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.480
musicians. It's become over the years Wales's biggest, best and most colourful carnival parade

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.480
and what can I say the excitement here is palpable. We've got 15 different sections, everything from

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:49.000
space aliens to dinosaurs to tributes to different cultures from Brazil, Africa and India and of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.160
course to commemorate our 25th anniversary Cardiff Carnival we will be having an exhibition in the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.360
Cardiff Story Museum in the old library in Cardiff in March of 2015 not least with some

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.080
fabulous prints from our good friends the Cardiff Camera Club. So happy carnival to everyone and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.920
yours with a quarter century of celebration behind him Steve Fletcher Swickr Carnival.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:26.680
So I'm Sally McLennan and I'm from Cardiff and I'm one of the one of three workshop leaders for

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.640
the carnival crew based in Cardiff which is a community participant group and we it's an all

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.840
inclusive group where everybody drums everybody dances everyone sings and everyone participates

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.720
in making costume and we perform carnivals we perform all sorts of events the beauty of the

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:56.880
group is that we have people from all of all ages so we have I think our youngest is eight and our

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.440
oldest is in their 50s or 60s and all levels of ability and everybody is like one big family gets

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.960
on really really well. Well Thelma you've been involved with the the carnival a long time just

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.520
tell me a little bit about it what it's meant what it's meant to you. I joined it in 203 and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.000
it's meant a lot to me because at the time I was feeling a bit low and down and it really helped me

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.640
to bring myself together and I thoroughly enjoyed it I've done a lot of sewing and putting and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.320
sticking things on and also getting brown fingers and enjoying the dances and everything

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.560
that goes on it's a very nice atmosphere to be in. Hello well I'm Johnny of Wanda Brass and I

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.240
suppose I've been with Wanda Brass for something like five seven probably closer to ten years

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.880
actually I should think. Wanda Brass is a band that is as old as the carnival is they're about

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:02.880
25 years old and going strong we we're made up of largely amateur players we started off as a

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.320
community band up in the valleys and then we've moved to Cardiff since most of our music we do

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.080
around Cardiff we get involved with various regular gigs parades events festivals and so on

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:22.440
and the music we play is as varied as the people we have we have we have jazz we have funk soul

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.480
scar and everything in between and the main point of Wanda Brass really is that everyone has fun

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.840
and what everyone enjoys about Wanda Brass is that they go to a gig and even if it's really hard

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.640
work and it is we we have real fun doing it and every rehearsal you know everyone's having fun

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.040
which is the main thing for us and yeah we are very pleased again to be part of Cardiff

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.480
carnival this year and we look forward to playing here again. Right Adrian what are you you're the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.360
costume designer? Yes that's me. What you doing here now what's been happening? It's the parade

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.560
line up everyone's getting face painted putting on the big costumes and lining up ready for the

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.240
start of the parade. What goes into preparing for a parade like this? Oh god that would take too

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.800
long to tell you months of work months of planning. And does the workshops that you hold before

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.960
the parade do they help? Oh gosh yeah that's where the costumes are made and created and as

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.360
you can see they're all around the car park. And where does your artistic talent come from

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.600
then in helping all this? I don't really know I don't I just look at something think I look

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.400
pretty and I make it. And what do you think about 25 years of the carnival? Oh it's awesome we do

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.680
ourselves proud today. We're called Bang On and we're from Hope Valley near Shrewsbury and we're

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.520
a samba band and we do a fusion of Bangra as well and we try to have loads of fun we just have good

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.080
fun together we've all come up on the train and we're at Cardiff mass or Cardiff carnival as

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.200
it's now called and we're going to start playing in a second behind some amazing Egyptian people.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:14.680
You've just seen the parade go through what do you think of it? I think it's very nice it's

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.440
amazing. I think it's very fascinating and quite international. It was completely amazing it's

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.160
a shame it rained but it was out of this world. There's a lot of work gone into that this it's

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.160
really worth coming to Cardiff to see. I think some of the costumes like the the fish and the

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.560
lion some of the top class costumes are amazing it's wonderful to see much bigger communities and

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.720
groups joining in this year and the standard of the costumes is fantastic. The stage today has

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.280
been absolutely round we've had huge audiences all day so the future is bright for Cardiff carnival

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.040
if we can get the businesses in the city centre to come and back us that's what we need we need

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.160
a small amount of money for every business and then we can make it bigger and we can take over the whole weekend.
