00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Press record.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Not by my phone, that would be bad.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So today is Wednesday the 31st of May 2023.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My name is Paul Hunt from Man Cap Cymru and could you introduce yourself please?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Yeah, my name is Janet Kensch and I'm a committee member and a volunteer with Man Cap Cymru.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So how did you get started with Man Cap Cymru again?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It was when we moved back here to West Wales.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I was born and bred in West Wales, well actually where I live now is about five minutes from where I was brought up in Sanderville.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I moved to Cardiff to do some work and then oh gosh I was there for, I had my two children and came back here with the whole family.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Back in 2001, because we were always looking for services for my daughter's school or any discipline.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We were looking at different organisations and got involved with Man Cap Ceredigion.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That was 22, 23 years ago.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
On the basis of knowing what was available.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I found out that Man Cap Ceredigion didn't really do anything for children.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
They were basically concentrated adults, which would have meant me walking away from them really because it didn't benefit Beth.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But I was talked into staying and getting involved with committee work and was on that committee then for a while.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So how old is Beth?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
She's now 30 this year. She was born in 92, so she'll be 31 this year.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So you spent some time in Cardiff?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
She was born in 92, I lived in Bathy. She was born in Llandoc Hospital.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It took us a few years to get some, well actually we've never had a diagnosis, a proper one.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But obviously we knew she had a learning disability when she was about two.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We'd looked at Swansea at that time, then we had Alcanson, Dylan, her brother.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So we pretty much knew when she was about two or three that she would have some difficulties.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And how easy was it to find services there compared to Ceredigion?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Just as difficult really. I can remember the time where the nurse, the district nurse, whatever you want to call her,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in the doctor's surgery saying, we haven't assessed, but yeah, it sounds like she'll need help.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And I can remember thinking, right, let's see what help is out there.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And sat in, we had a little library place in the house with a phone and desk.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And I thought, right, let's start, darling. And started bringing people up.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And they then would pass me on to somebody else, to another organization, so I did that.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And I suddenly realized that it was going to be very difficult to find support or help or advice,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000
because during that hour, I followed all the places I was led to and came back to the first person I spoke to.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So there was a lot of agencies out there, but no concrete support in any way.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And this is in Swansea now, all well-meaning and everything, but nothing with practical support.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Then we got social services involved, and that meant loads of assessments.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I mean loads, and they'd be coming to the house, a social worker, a nurse, a psychologist or something else.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And they'd come to the house and they'd be asking you the same questions.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And you'd think, oh, God, can you read the file before you came?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And I felt like somebody said, well, what you should do is record, like we're recording today,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
record everything and just say to them, look, I'll go make the coffee while you listen to the recording.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Because, you know, it was just repeating itself.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But no, it was very little support, really.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But then you don't know often what support you need either.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Now, that's what I found difficult.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
But we were there then for a few years and then we decided we...

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
She started a little school in Townhill, which was really lovely, Townhill School.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
A lot of people very snobbish about that.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We tried to get into a Welsh school and they said, I'll never forget this Dr Tanimie in Singleth Hospital.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Well, you know, you'd probably best stick to just teaching her English because, you know, when she grows up,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
there won't be many people speaking Welsh.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
She'll be able to support herself.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
You know, it was best to...

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And I regret that, really regret it, because, you know, she could have handled two languages easily.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But anyway, she went to Townhill School, lovely school.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And then we decided to come back home.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And it meant going through the whole process again, if you like.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But there was a difference, really.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000
There was a really good children's department or whatever you want to call it.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I think it was in Pembroke.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And the person who led it was Errol Bray.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
She's retired now, but I think she's still involved with a lot of stuff in the area.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And she had this unit there.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And they were really, really good.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
They had a good record.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
They set up a good respite system, although we never used it ourselves.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:27.000
They were involved with DASH, which was a parent led organisation that did holiday things.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
They took over these schools and you could come along.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And, you know, kids and the siblings as well, you know, would be in little groups and stuff.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
They did some respites in Teetlin, in Ketting near Aberaerhe.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Where people could, again, Bethan didn't take part in that.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
But, you know, your child could go there for a week and enjoy just being with other people.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
For the purposes of the tape, I should probably just say there's a gigantic dog sniffing around.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Which is not mine, by the way.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So as a unit, they were really, really good.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
But again, it was limited what they could do as well, really.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
But going back to my captain together, it's very limited what they could do because they were only really looking at adults.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But I always used to think, well, I'm glad I did get in contact with them because, you know,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
while your child is a child with a learning disability up until 18 to 25, you know,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
there's a duty for supporting them, you know, educationally and social services wise.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And getting involved in that kind of thing highlighted how different it was basically as an adult with disabilities,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
because that duty goes out through the window, really.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
What you're entitled to as an adult with an disability is totally different to the child.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So it was as much a shock to me then.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Well, I sort of planned ahead for Bethan as being an adult, knowing there wouldn't be anything really for her.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Far, far less than the support and services that she had as a child.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Growing up in Kheriteekyon as a child with disabilities was great for Bethan.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
She was lucky to be in Chandisil Primary School.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
They were very, very good.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
She went to an excellent secondary school in Newcastle Emily,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
even if they're headed by Helen Ling.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So, you know, her childhood and her upbringing was good compared to a lot of people I know.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I had a tough time with her, really.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I think we might have to pause and get the dog out because I think the breathing is going to be coming on the recording.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Oh, pause it. No, no, no, no. Pause it.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So we're recording again just to get rid of the dog.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So how did you feel when you first found out that Bethan had a learning disability?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Oh, God, I don't know. I've had to confuse her more than anything.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
The thing was that Bethan was born and a lot of my friends are having kids at the same time.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So she looked healthy. She looked beautiful, you know, to look at.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
But there were milestones that she wasn't compared to my friend's kids.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
So she would be walking at the same time as them, not talking at the same time as them.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I can remember thinking, saying, well, you know, your child should have a hundred words, you know, for that.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
She was nowhere near that.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000
But the main thing we noticed was her socialization, you know, where the other kids were starting to after about six months,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
noticing other children and getting involved or playing with things. Bethan wasn't like that, really.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And it took a while to convince doctors and nurses that I thought there was something wrong, you know.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
They'd say, oh, well, you know, children, they take a while.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
You know, she'll catch her, you know, in all this business. And she didn't.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And I think once I was told, yeah, you might be right here, I thought, no, thank God I've got something right.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Let's, you know, and I think there was a sense of or a mixture of relief or, I don't know,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
just the sense of that, you know, now we can get on with doing something about it.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
But as a parent, you will always have these feelings of great sadness and grief.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And, you know, depending on how severe that disability is, you know,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
they will be doing other things that your friends' kids will be doing, like, you know,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
going to university or getting married or having children.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And I think those milestones still hit you and you get quite emotional about it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But I'm lucky that, you know, I'm quite positive about Beth.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
She's quite an unique girl in her ways.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And because of that, I'd always be positive that she's beautiful and I can't think of her in any other way.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So, I, you know, I can't say I was upset, might be the wrong word, or hurt or whatever.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:56.000
But with me, it was a battle just getting on with it and making sure that she was happy, content and safe.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And I think it changed my view of how to be a parent and how what I wanted for my children,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
because I think if Beth hadn't been around, I would have been one of these pushy parents,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
you know, quite ambitious for them and push them to do this.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Whereas I'm far more relaxed and I'm certainly more relaxed with Dylan about, you know,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000
what he's wanted to do in his life and that, you know, the mantra is as long as they're happy and safe.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
That's it, you know, and that's all I want for them.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
But yeah, so that's that was basically how I felt.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
A lot of the Mencap groups were set up to provide social opportunities for people with a disability.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Having had a son without a disability to start with, what were the differences in terms of those opportunities?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
What? Between Beth and Dylan?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Yes.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Massive, massive.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000
We suddenly found out with Dylan how easy it was to bring up a child and go through those milestones.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Having with Dylan, you know, he potty trained himself really, basically.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000
He'd go to sleep at normal times. He'd eat what, you know, there wasn't any issues about feeding or anything.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
He'd socialize with other children, go off and play and stuff.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So there's a massive difference between Beth and the other.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:40.000
But what was lucky about us having Dylan as a second child was that Bethan seemed to speed up on her progression.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:48.000
She started speaking a lot faster and, you know, her mind stones were a bit faster getting through,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
knowing that Dylan basically was forcing her to catch up.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I mean Dylan would, you know, whereas with us, it would take us a little time to coach Bethan to say things and whatever.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Dylan would demand it, you know, come on Bethan, let's go, you know.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And it's been like that through the night really.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And to today now, he's a great support with her, very defensive.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And, you know, we'll look after her forever, I believe.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000
But what it's also done for Dylan is that he's been a better person for it, I think,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
because I know headmaster was telling me about him in primary school.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
One thing about Dylan is if there's a child who starts is new, starting,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
or there's a child who's sad or being bullied or finding it difficult,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Dylan's always the one to suss it all out or to go towards the child and support them in a way, be friendly and comfort them and so forth.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And that is because he's been Bethan's brother, you know.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And because of that, I think that's why he's gone into the field of supporting Mencap Ceredigion himself, you know.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
He supports us with all the social stuff that we do and all the workshops and stuff like that, and they love him.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
But, you know, he treats them as equals.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
He treats them as friends and, you know, lives them dearly.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:31.000
But the other thing is, I think, that he's gone into teaching now is again because he's the type that wants to support and help.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And that I truly believe that's because, you know, he's had a system of him, just probably.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
So back to Mencap Ceredigion, how did you first become aware of them?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Well, again, by ringing when we came back to West Wales, we had all these organizations, you know, getting a list of stuff and just ringing.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And I got to meet the chair who's an amazing man, Bill Thompson, who'd been a chair.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
He's now passed away.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And Mencap in those days were a bit different to what Mencap Ceredigion was different to what it is today.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And those Mencap Ceredigion in those days were far more involved with the provision of services and supported housing.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:40.000
They owned a few houses in the county and they employed, trained, you know, they were, you know, ran those supported housing issue.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And Bill Thompson was a great one for, I think he was ex service.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I think he was either Navy or, you know, one of these God through the war titles, you know, Sergeant Major, but such a gentle, lovely gentleman, you know.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And he'd kept the ship together and sort of set up all of these things, respite, supported housing, services, social clubs and all of that.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So it was all very, very well set up and everything when I got involved.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:27.000
He was very well respected by the professionals as well, by the authorities, you know, and well liked by the members.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And I think one of the nicest letters, I have a few letters that have been given to me in my life from, you know, people I've worked with when I've left, they've sent me a nice letter to see it by, you know.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.000
But the one I treasure the most is from him that he sent because I had to leave Mencap Ceredigion for some reason.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Because I was concentrating on some work issues and I said to him, look, you know, I won't be able to do so much.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And one of the letters I treasure the most is the letter he sent me.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And it's there and I often now read a bit when you know you think, oh God, you know, it's getting too much.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
You know, you get your bad days and you read that letter and it makes you feel really good, you know.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:21.000
He was he was an amazing man and he was the lead of a big, you know, quite a set of quite strong committee members made up of parents.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And they ran everything really basically until Mencap, Cymru came along or Mencap National.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I can't remember the name. Sintje.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Clive. No, that's the guy who came down to do the transitional bit of Mencap Ceredigion, giving the houses.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Howard. Howard Sintje. Yes. Clive is the guy that invented the seat, the bikes.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Howard Sintje. And I remember he came to the Feathers Hotel to have a meeting with us and to reassure us that we were doing the right thing, really.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
But I didn't get involved with that so much.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And I think the transition was quite small because the authorities helped it a lot.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And there was some housing associations as well.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:20.000
And we have today supported housing in the county that are managed out by Mencap and by MIRAS.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
But they wouldn't be what they are without Bill Thompson and that committee.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
They set it up. It was like fine.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
You know, really well looked after, well managed.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
So it's quite easy to just pick it up and go.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
What was the reason that they transferred over to?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:49.000
I don't know what it was. I think I don't know because I wasn't involved with it at the time.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Whether it was because the parents were getting quite elderly now and it was a lot for them.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And I mean, every organization will find this. It's hard to get people on board committees and being trustees.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000
There's a lot of responsibility nowadays for that, whether it was that or whether and this is my guess,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:24.000
whether it was the legislations and so forth and the amount of liability the authorities had,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
whether it was better for them to get involved with it really.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And so Mencap then was involved with the whole thing of support and services and education and living accommodation and everything.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
To what we are today, which is something totally different and is run totally differently as well.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:56.000
But he was an amazing man and we were very, very lucky to have him in Ceredigion.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
We were very lucky to have the committee as well.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
You've mentioned that when you joined Mencap Ceredigion didn't do much with younger people.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Were there any other young people of members or were the parents similar age to you when you first joined?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:25.000
No, they were a lot older than me, the parents, because obviously their kids were adults.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:33.000
My child was a child. But the great thing about it was though, better than getting involved with all the activities.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000
If we had a disco, I'd bring the kids along. So the committee got to know them very, very early on.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000
But what was really great is that my child, my children were getting to know the adults with their disabilities.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
So I was learning what it was going to be like in the future. And so did Beth and Dylan.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And now Beth and Dylan are friends with these adults who are now obviously in their 50s and 60s.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
So they know them as friends now. It is literally like a family.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
We know them all. We know their parents. We know what they had for breakfast, what their favorite things are.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And I think the one thing that with Mencap Ceredigion is, and they're probably the same with other branches in Wales,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
and something that people don't realize or need to realize and need not to forget is that with Mencap Ceredigion,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:36.000
we are the only constant in their lives from the time they come on board as adults when they're 18, 29, to the time they die.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Because they will have support workers coming and going. Social workers will come and go. Doctors, nurses, teachers, you name it, whatever.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:58.000
They'll come and go. But with Mencap Ceredigion, we're pretty much there because we don't change in any way.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
We're the same committee, we're the same parents, we're the same members. Nothing changes.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
So I think that's quite a good thing about our organization.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:19.000
And for Beth and until then, they've got people that they've known, like the members I know, that we see coming to Gateway and to all the events that we hold.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:33.000
I've known them for nearly 25 years. So there's a certain element of trust and knowledge, which in effect is really, really important when you're planning on what we do as a service now.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000
We're able to listen to them and understand them more than anybody really, besides their own family and friends, obviously.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:51.000
But certainly we know them more than a social worker. And that's not being disrespectful to the social worker, but that's just being practically honest.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:59.000
They're not going to know what people are like after knowing them for 25 years compared to knowing them from a file for five minutes.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:12.000
How did you gradually, your role with Mencap Cairdigan gradually change over the years? Because you're the chair now, is that?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
No, I wasn't the chair. I was going, you know, the lead of that.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:27.000
My half-goals are out to chairs, you know, deputy chairs, secretaries, treasurers, I don't know if all we say.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:38.000
I came on board really with another lady who was involved with Mencap Cairdigan then, and that was Karen Blower.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:46.000
We were both the same age, the same. We like the same thing, we got quite friendly.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
And our job really was to organize all the discos.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:01.000
But we were new onto that committee and much as I loved all the committee members, oh, they were all fashioned about their attitude to people with learning disabilities.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
I mean, we had to bring them up to the 20th century.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:14.000
You know, a lot of stuff had happened since, you know, 1983 with the new legislation and, you know, the turn of the century with education and, you know, the Education Act.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
But they seemed to rule so back in the 1960s.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
And although we lived them to bits, Karen and I had to work really hard.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
You know, we used to give money out to organizations.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:37.000
And one of the things that I think was Kenal and Stiff and the Day Center in Lampeter for people with disabilities wanted a computer.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
So they sent us a letter to the committee and we then had a discussion.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
And most of the committee members were aghast with a computer.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
What do you mean a computer? People with disabilities don't use computers.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
But what do you do? They're silly, ridiculous.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:04.000
And we had to really fight hard to convince our committee that actually, yeah, you know, and of course today with phones,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000
I've had members come to me and I'll say, because I'm not technical, as you know, and I'll give them the phone saying, well, how do I do this, actually?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Or, you know, you surf or whoever it is.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And they'll take the phone off me and they'll sort they've sorted it out.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:28.000
So technically, our members are really up there, especially with social media, perhaps there's a bit too much in social media.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
But it was difficult. I can remember one instance.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
We were organizing it.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
It was our first goal at organizing Christmas Disco in TGN.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
And I was at Lampeter University.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Can't remember either one.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
And we were dealing with the menu.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:55.000
And we decided that we'll have chicken and, you know, and these chicken, they can't have chicken.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
They just have sausage and chips.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Why? Well, it's easy to cut it up for them.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
And I would look at each other and this is from another era, you know.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
So but we won that time.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
We got them chicken and, you know, proper dinner that they could cut themselves.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
I think so.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
We were in it.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
You know, it was you could see the generation gap there.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Really big time.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
And I'm not sure.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
I think Bill Thompson was with us, you know, he said, Oh, yeah, I get you.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I get you.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:48.000
But a lot of the committee members were really stuck in, you know, the the the old fashioned way of looking after all the awareness of people in those days.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
So.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
How they pushed back on some of those things and definitely.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:07.000
I can remember talking to them about the development of cardiac and other have a gateway and that what has that started back 60 years ago again through Mencap.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
You know, these tech gateways, so they still do.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
We still do.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:28.000
But in those days, it was if you walked into a room, it would be the children and talking children in their 40s, 50s with the mums, the mums were knitting and the children do the jigsaws.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
That was his social life.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And they used to call it the knitting club because the mums would bring their knitting along.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Those attitudes have totally changed now.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I mean, our social clubs now, whereas they used to be run and many of them still do in day centers, we purposely took them out to the day centers because we wanted them to be in the community.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:00.000
So our I know that our business is a bit difficult because I've been running separate to us and they have it in a football club or whatever.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Not in a running club because there's a lot of security in the way.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
But the ones that we've set up in.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
It's our South.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
It's like Cardigan.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Now is a Cardigan Castle Cafe.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Again, with the community, the one in Upper Vyland.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
That one is a bit difficult.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
We're in a hole for that one.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
But the one in Newcastle, Emlyn is in a pub.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
The one we're going to be setting up soon in Fentasil.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
That's going to be a pub.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Purposely because we're in the community and what we found is that the community are now getting involved with us.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Last Saturday, we had a meeting in the Three Compasses Net here in Newcastle, Emlyn and they did a buffet for us and we brought our music system with us, which is the best thing we've ever bought.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
We had microphones and we were all listening to music in the beer garden, dancing and everything.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
And all of a sudden the locals are coming out and joining in.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000
We've got a video of them all dancing with us and a group had come up for the weekend from Swansea and they joined in.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:19.000
We had the microphones and we were all singing like karaoke and we were getting raffles because of the fundraiser.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
I don't know if it was 20 or 30 but they said, no, keep it clear.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
They had a fortune on it.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:34.000
But what was good was that the community was involved with us and we were involved with the community in front of you.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:46.000
And I think that's, if you're asking for the difference between what it was like and what it is now, that's a very big positive as far as our members can see.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:54.000
All the different communities being with the groups that you take into cafes.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Absolutely. Well, think of it this way.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
People want to be kind.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
There are more good people than bad people as Ros Angus said.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
There are more people there who want to help you than want to turn their backs.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
So you want to take advantage of that really.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:23.000
But on the business side of it, can you imagine when we went to Newcastle Ebelin, the Cardigan one, the Aberyne one was getting too full.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
So we went to Cardigan to decant to some of the world and we opened one in Cardigan.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
That was getting too full.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
So we then opened one in Newcastle Ebelin.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
And I can remember going through Newcastle Ebelin, which in its day was a pub town really.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
We had about 26 pubs in it in those days.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
It's not so much that now.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:54.000
But going around with pubs to see whether we could open some sort of...

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
And everybody was really, yeah, yeah, yeah, they'd love it.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:06.000
But what we went for, we went there on a Wednesday night, I'll never forget, and the pub was empty midweek.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Nothing happens in midweek.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
And there were fewer locals in there, I think very much.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
And it was the three campuses and we looked and it was ideal.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
It had a snooker table. Great.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
It was an area to dance.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
There was a place to eat.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
A beautiful beer garden.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
And Wednesday was a quiet night.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
So we had a word with Pete and Jill.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
They said, yeah, great.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
If you want, we'll do some food and we'll welcome them.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
So we had a problem.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
So now tonight, there's going to be a gateway there.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
There's going to be about 30, 40 people there.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Every one of them will be eating.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
They'll probably spend a good tenner with drinks and everything.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:55.000
So it's gone from a pub with a couple of locals down on a Wednesday night to a pub that's heaving.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
And what's good about it is that the locals knowing there'll be a disco,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
there'll be something on during the night.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
It's a pop pool. It's a busy pub, precise pub.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
We'll go there.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
So the locals, we're actually helping commercially as well.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
And that goes for all the other gateways that we've got in the community.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
So it benefits the town as well, really.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
The Premier Shop next door tells me they make a bomb on a Wednesday night.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
And then I say, why is that?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Well, of course, we do a Rathford, don't we?

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And they're all in there, our lot, buying sweets.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
We've been told off about that before now that we shouldn't be raffling off sweets.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
But anyway, that's what the members want.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And they make a bomb on these sweets they buy and bring the bars of chocolates or box of chocolates.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
They make a mark in an increase in profits.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
What would have happened if you'd suggested taking people to the pub when you first joined Bank of Carid again?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
I don't know. I think they would have been concerned.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Because with their gateway, you know, bingo.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
We do bingo. They love the bingo.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
But only one game takes about 10 minutes, not the whole night.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
And then they go to a restaurant once a month or something.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Nothing wrong with that. But our members now, people with disabilities, they're expecting more out of us.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
You know, they want to work. Some don't want to work, but some do.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Some want to study more. Some want to socialize more.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Some want to travel. Some want to have a romantic relationship.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Some want to get married.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:53.000
You know, they're, they're what they want nowadays is a lot more than what it was, I mean, you know, 30, 40 years ago.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000
So you as an ACORUS then, as a charity, you've got to, you know, it's member led.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
They are the ones that tell us what to do.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Like tonight, this morning it was on Facebook.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Oh, what are we doing tonight, Jan? I don't know. What do you want to do?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
You know, it's not we'll do this or any other.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:22.000
So then we spend a fortune on pub, garden games, you know, like Giant Connect 4s and Giants.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Games and the garden. So we're, we're, I danced like, but outside.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Yeah. And it's their choice. It's their side, you know.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
That's the difference. Big difference. When you joined, would you say?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
No, I don't think it was. No.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:49.000
I mean, I think things have changed, not as a main category, but things have changed because of the different acts.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Like advocacy, self-advocacy, we're teaching our members now to have a voice.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
We're teaching people to listen to those voices.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Nothing without us, to take gratitude. It's there.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:13.000
That makes it a lot easier for us because they can, we'll organize it for them, but we don't have to think about what to do.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
They'll tell us what to do.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:23.000
I think as long as they listen, people listen to them, then, then, you know, we'll be okay.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:31.000
But there's still a lot of people out there whose attitude is, you know, for them.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Was it something that happened gradually becoming member led or was it just happened over time?

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
It was a gradual thing as we were concerned.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000
We still had people who didn't quite understand, were not very peace-tee about things.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
So it took a while. And there's still a battle sometimes.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.000
In fact, I often think with the situation we're in at the moment with a lot of cuts and the service has been cut back and stuff like that,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
that we are getting back to that.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000
So there's a big, big danger of getting back to the old days where, you know,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
it's whatever money you've got, that's what you get.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:27.000
And we're not listening to other people as much as to looking at money, vice versa.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:38.000
How easy has it been for your members of the learning disability to get used to leading the organization and making decisions?

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
That's a hard one, really.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:49.000
I mean, we had a self-applicacy group in Kennedy, Cuncone, Kennedy Dump People's Fellows, and that finished.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
And we were left to know with no advocacy service, self-application, because there wasn't any advocacy service.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
But legislation has changed, not for the better, I'm afraid.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
So Mencak Kennedy decided that we'd set up our own self-advocacy group.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
And it was called, the members called it our voice, our choice.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And we helped it for a while, facilitated it, helped them with meetings, administrations, stuff like that, until they were set up.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And we consciously then let them go.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Because one thing with self-advocacy, it has to be independent of any other organization, any other service, because otherwise it won't work.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And we were really, really big on that.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:47.000
But it is difficult to get them to run the meeting effectively.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
So you still need to support them.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
But it has to be that it's supporting them and not doing it for them.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
And that's been a really difficult transition, especially if you're somebody like me.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
I like to be in control of stuff.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.000
And I, you know, I blame myself a lot where I'd be in the meeting and I'd say, oh, you don't do it that way.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
You do it this way, you know, and then I'm trying to have the hands off.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
It's more my problem, I think, than their problem.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Because on Saturday they had a meeting and I would stick myself out of the chair and I'd be like, I'm not saying a word and keep your mouth.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
And you know what? They ran it fine.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:40.000
So I think there's a bit of confidence in letting them get on with it, but be there to be supportive and not be doing it.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
So Mencap-Carradiguan is separate to Mencap-Cumbria.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
What's that relationship been like in the last 20 years?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:40:00.000
It's been an odd one, really, to be honest with you, because first of all, it's difficult for people outside that don't know us to differentiate the two.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
And I think they have to, to be honest, because we do two different things, as far as I'm concerned.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Mencap-Carradiguan is a branch, very small branch, of volunteers.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Mencap-Cumbria is a charity and it's throughout Wales.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
And we're not the same in as much. We have the same ideals.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
We have the same hopes and so forth for our members.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
We support them in the same way, but we do two different things.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
So that was difficult for me because I.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000
I thought of them as two separate things in as much one fighting the other for the same thought, if you know what I mean.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
And that was hard for me, especially funding wise.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:02.000
There were a couple of issues that really I wasn't happy about where, for instance, if somebody did a will.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
And it was somebody died and it was somebody in Cairnicuon.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
The money that that will was going to was going to Cardiff.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
So we we didn't get a look in. So there's a lot of that going on.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
But I don't know. And we work really, really closely now.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
I think we've got a really good positive relationship.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Wayne is very supportive of the work that we do.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:39.000
As is he's supportive of all the other branches and you yourself, Paul and all the other staff always at the end of the phone.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
The the the head office, you know, in Kidaminsters, where the main office is.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Peter Brands. There's another.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Oh, there's there's nothing.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:59.000
That they won't do for you if you want to get free T-shirts or you want some advice on, you know, volunteering at shows or

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
insurance or stuff like that. They're there.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
And I think as a small branch, you need that big brother support.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Do you know what I mean? But at the same time, Wayne's really good in letting us get on with this as well.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
As long as what we do is legal. I don't think he's bothered.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
But, you know, he's really, really supportive.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:30.000
And it seems like, you know, one of the things I do find with being in West Wales,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
big gripe with me is everything is happening in Cardiff, you know.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Well, if if if a charity is an all Wales charity, they should be covering all of Wales.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
You know, they get the funding to support all of Wales.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
But you often find all of these charities are based in Cardiff and all the money is drifted over to Cardiff.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Whereas we make a pit with Medcap. They very much I feel and I see anyway that they spread their resources across Wales.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
They spread their funding, if possible, across Wales and all their projects and all their people.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
I mean, now we've got a development officer, Rod Drews, who lives in Llandronddol that comes westward.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
I've never had that before.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:24.000
And, you know, I think I think we're quite lucky as a branch to be associated with Medcap as a whole.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000
And, you know, to recognize, well, respect and charity.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Plus, we've got our supported housing as well here, half of which are covered by Medcap as well.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
So, you know, we've got a strong base in Cardiff.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
I know a lot of other counties don't even have a branch.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:50.000
But, you know, we're I think it's quite a good outfit where the national, regional and branch works really, really well together.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Could you tell me a little bit about the Comic Con?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Comic Con, we as a branch, the fingers in lots of pies, you know, we have a gateway, we have a swimming swimming group,

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
we've got gardening, artwork, Sunday lunch clubs, all sorts of things.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:21.000
But my daughter was really, really interested in a lot of our members in animation, anime, Disney and other Japanese stuff.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:33.000
And she used to love dressing up and going to what you call them Comic Cons, you know, conventions where you dress up and so forth.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:41.000
I wish I'd taken her to London and stuff. I remember taking her to one in The Hex article, one of these big places anyway.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Excel Center.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Excel Center.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Excel Center. And I can remember going in there and she was dressed up, I wasn't.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000
And I felt really, really standing out, you know, I was in normal clothes and everybody else was dressed up.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
And it's a massive place. And there's this big room in there.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
And they were all collecting something or other, bits, thousands.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
And somebody said to me, there's 80,000 people in this room, all dressed up.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
And I know that there's only 75,000 living in Keredikyo. We could have filled the whole of Keredikyo.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.000
And there's a massive, massive different things to do with animation.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:28.000
But what I noticed was an awful lot of people with learning disabilities and autism were really keen.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Why, I don't know, but there's a massive following.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
And Bethan used to go to all these places.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000
And I've said there's only two places that I have seen Bethan, which I would say she fits in.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
She's like a normal person, if there's such a word as normal.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:53.000
And that's Disneyland Paris, Disneyland in Florida and any convention.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Right. And they fit in.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
And I remember Bethan, we were driving back from London and she said to all these journeys,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
can we not have one in Wales? Can we not have one in Keredikyo?

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
I said, what? A convention? Yeah.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
I said, oh, yeah, I suppose we could.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
And we said, yeah, that'd be a great idea.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Nothing ever happened.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
And there's this one particular like, we were in Cardigan, I'll never forget, Cardigan Gateway.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
And there was a support worker there, it was new and I'd never seen her before.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:36.000
And Bethan hooked up to this support worker and there was disco and dancing and they were talking together.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
And they were really into each other type of thing.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
And I spoke to her and her name was Rowan.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
And she said, oh, Bethan's fascinating. I love anime, she said.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:56.000
And she and Bethan had this t-shirt on with some anime remark that any serious, serious anime person,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
no one else knew about it but an anime person.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
And she was attracted to that t-shirt.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:09.000
And it turned out that Rowan, not only had she been to Japan, where Bethan would love to go to,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
she'd actually gone to university in Japan to study animation.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And she was actually involved with wild films on a part-time basis as well.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
So she was doing a bit of support work and she was involved in that.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:33.000
And what developed out of that was Rowan and Bethan, Hannah, who was another support worker,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
who was a brilliant artist and animator, and Jake, who is a well-known,

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Jake Wittaker is a well-known filmmaker in County, teamed up, the four of them,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
and they set up Kennedy County Animation Group.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:56.000
And with that group, they meet up on a regular basis and they've made good three, four, five films, animated films.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000
During Covid, they were having Zoom meetings every week.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:08.000
And not only are members in Kennedy County, but people from Cardiff, Bridgend, Pembrokeshire,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
and they meet up on Zoom and they're brilliant artists as well.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
And they do an awful lot of work together. And they've had some awareness days.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:24.000
They've had some workshops in Cardigan, Small World Theatre and everything.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000
And we got some money from Wild Films and Film Company to actually have a convention.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.000
And so we had the first convention and about three or four hundred people came along to it.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
We'd made two films for it. We're actually in the Aberystwyth Arts Centre.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:53.000
We had the next one then on the 28th of March. I'll never forget it. 2020 or 2019. When was Covid? 2020.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.000
And that was the week that Kennedy had decided to do a lockdown. We did it a week before, actually.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:07.000
And I'd bethoned on the computer telling everybody that we had to cancel.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
But we had ours about two months ago. We've got loads of people coming along.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.000
And we're now determined, unless we've got another Covid, to do it on a manual basis.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Is it just people with a learning disability coming to the convention?

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Most are, yeah. But no, there are people there as well who are just interested in animation.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.000
And it's working with universities and other agencies.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:47.000
But I can see it being a lot, lot bigger than what it is. But it's just getting there slowly.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
What was the impact of Covid on the organisation?

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Crikey. That was a big shock to us because everything came to a stop. It wasn't a gradual stop. It was a stop.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000
So all our social clubs couldn't meet.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:15.000
So we, within a week, decided, and we were probably one of the first, to use social media.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:22.000
I found out about Zoom. Never heard of Zoom before. Still don't quite understand how it works, but anyway.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:31.000
And very, very quickly, we were using FaceTime. We got a lot of volunteers along.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:39.000
And we did things with our members. Things like Monday night was a quiz night.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Wednesday, Saturday, comedy nights. Everyone had to come along with a joke.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Marks had a ten. We had Friday coffee morning. Then we had things like Keep Fit.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:02.000
We could have volunteers that did Keep Fit with them. We did some cooking. We didn't do much cooking actually. We could have done more.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:13.000
We had Tom, Tom Evans, who is a writer. He's got a relative with learning disabilities.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:26.000
And he wrote a whole book, if you like. And he read, he wrote it and read it every single day of the lockdowns.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Every day. And other people did, I mean, Rihanna, for instance, she used to do the competition of the week where she'd take a photo of a jar with jelly beans in it.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:50.000
And you had to guess how many. So on a Monday, you'd have the picture and then people would be sending in their guessing, you know.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:56.000
And the next week would be a box of pencils. How many pencils? Things like that.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:04.000
They would get involved with that sort of thing. And then we got a pop group Dunlom was friends with.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000
And the lead singer did a Nightwake, sang all the songs from the group.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000
And we had George from Captain Entertainment having discos.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
And we were really, we were fat, I used to say, and busy an hour with them when we were before Covid.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:29.000
But the other thing that we did as well was we were on the other side of the phone.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:38.000
If people were in need of any help, and we would refer, like if people couldn't get to a shop or something like that, we could ring the authorities and get them to a food bank or whatever.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:51.000
So there was that link. But what we were conscious of was that not many people, people who weren't on social media, how were they coping?

00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:02.000
We were disappointed, I have to say, with some of the supported housing organizations not being supportive and getting their members on social media.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Every house has got a computer stuck in their office. That's a problem.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.000
But there was nobody, I can remember one support worker telling me, I don't agree with social media.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
I think it's terrible that they can, you know, can all sort of problems. I don't really care what you think.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:27.000
I want that person on Facebook. He's able to do it. I want you to support it. And as it was, you have to.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:41.000
But I think the worst thing about Covid for certain people who weren't in contact with us through social media or Zoom was they missed their friends.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:51.000
You know, a lot of people think people with disabilities, you know, they're not really good at communicating or socializing or, you know, they don't have eye contact.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000
So how can they make friends and have, you know, all of this business?

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:02.000
But actually, they are the most social people in the world and they really, really missed Gateway.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:11.000
There was one person who used to ring me every week. I know what he said to me on the other side of the phone was,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:18.000
When is the Christmas disc of? When is the Gateway? When is, when am I going to see my friends and stuff?

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:25.000
And they were breaking their hearts because they could, they just didn't have a social life.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:33.000
And I always think, and I see these policies coming from the World Trade Assembly, you know, supporting people to go to work,

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:43.000
whether they like it or not, they're going to be supposed to go to work or supporting people to live independently, to cook, to pay their bills.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
I know it's a different things, but there's very, very little.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000
I was hoping they'd learn from the Covid situation, fairly little about social life.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000
And they are allowed, they have a right to have a social life.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:08.000
But there's very little provision out there for a social life, supporting people to go out, not just go to the pub.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.000
I've seen support workers taking people for a coffee. Going for a coffee seems to be a big thing.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:26.000
But the thing about socialising, helping them to get to know other people, for instance, that's what we aim to do with our gateways.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:38.000
And we, you know, a social worker who sits next to a person in one of our gateways and they don't get involved with their client or other people.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.000
They're there on their phones. We take a photo of them and we show them it.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:52.000
So this is not the way to support people. So we encourage our social workers and support workers.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:05.000
And they do to not only get involved with the clients, but also get involved with the whole group so the client can get to know people, be friendly, you know, socialise.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:11.000
And they get a lot more out of their social events by doing that, really.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
They missed it over coffee.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
And then I think we're getting really upset.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:26.000
But I tell you, the first gateway part of the plant, I mean, there were tears, you know, there were just hugs.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Although we weren't supposed to hug, we were.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:42.000
But that was the first time we had was really emotional, which just goes to show that people with disabilities can, you know, have certain relationships that are really important to them.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:51.000
When lockdown ended and things got back to normal, did things for Mencap Cairdegon get back to normal straight away or?

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000
We really wanted to get back straight away into normality.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000
There were legislations that stopped us to do it as fast as we could do, I suppose.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.000
You know, we had to have our meetings outside instead of inside and all of this business.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000
We had to have masks. We had to do this, we had that, which, you know, made life a little bit difficult.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000
But I would say within a month we were back to normal.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Were the members back to normal?

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Yeah, to a certain degree, I think.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:33.000
I think it took them a bit of time, you know, with wearing the masks and the worry of COVID and, oh, we can't touch or, you know, things like that.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:45.000
And especially support workers who worked for agencies who were very strict about, you know, wearing the mask for a lot longer than they needed to or couldn't sit next to people.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Their regulations were quite strict, really.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Whereas we were more laid back, I suppose, more maverick, more in your face, which makes it more disappointing that a lot of agencies now, certainly the authorities, are still not back to normal.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
The day centres are still not open.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
And we're talking three years now.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
The offices are still not manned.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:21.000
You know, now if I want to get in contact with somebody in social services, I've got to go through the reception area.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:28.000
They take my telephone number or my email address and then that person will come back to me.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:35.000
And I know that person is working from home, which often means the baby's crying in the background or the dog is barking.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000
You know, my computer's down, my computer's next door, I can't, oh dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:48.000
You know, things have not gone back to normal and it'll take a while, I think.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:57.000
People have been given choices of working from home, which I think is good because, you know, environmentally it's good.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:08.000
But they need to be making sure that the service doesn't change and the people that are working from home are actually working in a place that can be adapted into a working area.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
And I don't think that's been done.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:19.000
And I think we're missing out on services certainly because of that and the way services are run at the moment.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.000
So they're far, far slower to get back to normal.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000
But as far as we're concerned, as if COVID never happened really.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:33.000
So finally, been at Mencap Coyote again 20, 23 years.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000
23.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Are there any new Jans joining?

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Oh, I hope so.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:54.000
It's hard to get volunteers, really hard, especially nowadays because, you know, people are working one, two jobs.

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.000
You know, things are harder nowadays, really.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
We've got a couple of people coming along.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I think it's more mindful than anything in trying to let things go.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I'm the worst one to delegate.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I give somebody a job to do.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
You know, they're not doing it properly.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Give it to me, I'll do it.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I'll finish it all, I'll do it.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:34.000
But we have started, we have to do one again, where we had a friends' tea, where it's a mixture of interested friends and parents.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And I think we need to work and persevere on that because otherwise, you know, no, there won't be another Jan.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And you've got to have another journal, you know, to have a pool of volunteers, you know, to take over for the future.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Well, I think we'll finish there.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Thank you very much.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Lost it.
