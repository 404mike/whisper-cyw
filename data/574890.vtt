Recollections of Arthur Davies. Home life was very American. My dad spoke Welsh and my mother some Welsh, but we spoke English at home.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
My father had a magnificent tenor voice and I remember that I would wake up in the morning and he would be out gardening.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And I can still hear those marvelous songs he was singing, some of them Welsh, some of them English.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I had a great time while at the Welsh Church. It was an exciting place for music. People sang their hearts out. You couldn't stop them.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
To me it was thrilling. The volume, sincerity and the love of music. I have never heard anything like it anywhere.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I think that the Welsh people are the only ones I know of that sing like a choir.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We'd get together with the basses, the tenors, sopranos. Rather than listening to a choir, it became a choir.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We sang everywhere. Alki Beach, Woodland Park at the picnics. People would gather round just to listen. It was natural. No song sheets. It wasn't anything contrived.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The Welsh people formed a very close-knit group and it was really a community unto itself.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You can be sure that everybody went to Mrs. Williams' delicatessen before they go anywhere else.
