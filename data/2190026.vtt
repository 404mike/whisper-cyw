I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church at Handedno for the Longest Yarn

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.000
and I'm with Sue Aspinall who's going to talk about her father's experiences during the war.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Thank you Sue, so you know a little about your father and you have some memories of it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.680
Yes I do and my father was Cecil Rigby and he initially joined the army

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.200
but was caught on the beaches in Dunkirk, so when I say caught in the boat.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.400
So he managed to get back but had significant sort of problems with his kidney so much so that they

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:50.240
rushed him to my grandmother's house at the time and operated on him on a kidney and on the wooden

00:00:50.240 --> 00:01:02.000
kitchen table and obviously I wasn't born then but so from what I can gather he then came out

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.440
of the army and joined the air force and was very successful in that he became a squadron leader with

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:23.680
Spitfires and he still didn't really talk an awful lot about it. We know he was based down there and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:36.240
he was based at one stage with two other people and my mother kept flat for them so they could

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.360
when they weren't on duty they could go and relax there. So he had a very distinguished career

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.400
because he became a squadron leader having gone in as was he a pilot? Yes he was so he'd like to fly

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.240
and and rose quite up the ranks so talking about the problems on his kidney it was something that

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.600
happened at Dunkirk which was that he drank? Well I'm assuming as the story goes that he drank

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:17.760
water from sea water or infected water and he was very lucky to get on a boat to come home.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.640
And to be operated on the kitchen table was something else too? It was a big wooden one.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.400
Was it? A good table.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.280
I don't know quite how they sorted it out that's where the story goes anyway.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.400
Thanks Sue very much that was lovely thank you thanks very much.
