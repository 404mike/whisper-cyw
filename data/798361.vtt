My favourite ciders are what I call Herefordshire style, but I'd say that the Welsh ciders are

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.440
traditionally of Herefordshire style rather than South West style or Eastern County style.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:25.160
They're fairly what I call beefy ciders. There's a lot going on in your mouth. I use pure wild

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.720
yeast fermentations with our products and I believe that although it can give you more

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:39.320
spoilage, it also gives you a much better depth of flavour in the product. You draw out the tannins,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.280
you draw out the acids, you have a well-balanced... I like really, really dry ciders. I don't want

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.880
anything to be complicated by sweetness really. The same broadly with the Perry, you know, the

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:02.560
really dry, crisp... I quite like quite acidic products. I made some cider this year of out of

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.840
Broxwood Foxwell which the juice has come out and it's bright pink at the moment. Really,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.360
really bright pink. Don't know what it'll be like by the time it's fermented, but it's...

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.560
and I love that, but it'd be way too acidic for some people. So there are a million and one

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.200
different ways to make cider. You know, everyone makes it differently and you can choose according

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.240
to what product you want to make and what you believe in at the end of the day. Like most people,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.560
I've done Peter Mitchell's cider making course, spent a week with him. I came away with some

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.800
useful information, but I don't make my cider his way. I have very, very little in common. In fact,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.040
we both start with apples. There's really very, very little in common between how he makes his

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.840
and how I make mine, but I have to say I prefer drinking mine. I prefer the world yeast,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.200
I prefer the depth. That's how I like it.
