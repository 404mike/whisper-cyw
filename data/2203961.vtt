00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
I remember being on a bus and there was a lot of noise and it was very scary and

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.480
then you know talking to my family transpires that that was the bus that

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.920
was taking us to the airport we were not allowed to take anything with us and the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.080
noise was I think based around the fact that my mum had smuggled a photograph of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.520
her wedding photograph and the army officer said she couldn't take it and

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.920
there was a bit of a kerfuffle and they smashed it. It was such a scary time and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.080
my dad used to tell us this story about how he went to get our passports done

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.560
because we didn't have passports and he said that if you looked at an officer in

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.560
the eye they would very likely hurt you if not shoot you. My sister I remember

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.480
her telling me this this awful thing that where she used to walk to school

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.000
and there was a river that she used to pass walking to school and she'd see dead

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
bodies floating on the river. It was just a horrendous time for everybody what

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.360
they went through the fear not just in losing everything that they had but also

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.440
potentially losing their lives losing their loved ones because it was such an

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.000
erratic time you know the military officers were just completely

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.240
inconsistent spontaneous with you know with how they treated people with their

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.040
attacks and so yes
