00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So what kind of man was Rabbi Graf?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
He was lovely, he was very slow with speech.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
His sermon, which you could have read through in about 10 minutes,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
would last out for about half an hour because he was so slow in speech.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So yes, but he was a lovely man and he believed, whereas the Orthodox,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you couldn't ask why in the Orthodox, it is.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It is written, that's the way it's been.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Whereas in the Reform you could ask, and you've got answers,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
they may not have been the answers you were expecting,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but you could ask any question of the religion, of the faith, of God even.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Whereas the word God, I don't know, you practically had to bow in the Orthodox,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
you know, there was an enormous different distance between whoever took the services

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
or whoever led the services in Orthodoxy, but not to that massive amount.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Rabbi Graf never kept kosher.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
A lot of the people that came through the Holocaust, a lot of German Jews,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I don't think kept kosher.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I don't think you can somehow assimilate what they went through in Germany

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to get out of Germany and what they were forbidden to do there.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And they might have been kosher in Germany, but it's such a massive gap in everything.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Your whole life's been turned upside down,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that I think a lot of Jews went out of the habit of kosher.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I mean, there were kosher butchers here in Cardiff, there was Krotofskis and there was Kays,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and there was the meat shop down on Bridge Street.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But no, I mean, my parents went to continental, more continental, yeah.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And that was Wallis.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Solomon started that, the parents, his parents, and it went on to be Wallis.
