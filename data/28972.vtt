Penawine

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.160
The original Penawine farmhouse stood on the northern slope of Daren The, which is

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.520
southeast of Glyncorrug. Its fields descended to the northeastern corner of

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.240
the church and along the bank of the River Corrug to the Contour factory. The

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.640
reason for the awkward location at the edge of the holding is thought to be

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.040
that the lower fields were once part of another holding. The farm dates back to

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.440
the year 1570 when it was in possession of Hopkin ap Yean ap Hopkin, but the

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.560
farmhouse fell into ruins over the years and is not recorded in the 1851 census.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.640
The farmhouse was said to have been replaced by a house on the other side of

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.240
the farm in a more convenient spot called Tinna Pant. The house is of course

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.240
already in existence.
