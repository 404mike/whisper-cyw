Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.280
Interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewee Siobhán Grice, location of the interview

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.040
Swicker office and today's date is the 19th of October 2015. Before we start

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.040
Siobhán, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:27.040
Certainly. My name is Siobhán Grice, S-I-O-B-H-A-M-G-R-I-C-E.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.080
Thank you very much indeed. How did you first make contact with Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:40.080
I was involved with a dance group that Sally ran. I just went along to the classes

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:48.080
and as it happened they were rehearsing for the 98th Carnival so I started off as a dance group.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.080
So Sally McLennan was your gateway and she still is for many people to this very day.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.120
She's the musical director, which involves dance as well obviously, for the Carnival crew.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.120
So Sally dates right back in time. And in 1998 you were a dancer in the Carnival.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.120
So can you remember what you were wearing perhaps? What kind of costume did you have?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.120
I know we had big headdresses.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.120
What a surprise.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:24.160
Yes, and it was quite Egyptian type costumes and lots of blues and silvers.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.160
I can see the costume in my mind. We have a picture of that which will be going into the archive.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.160
So we can tell you that's what you were wearing.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.160
I've got pictures of you going over Cotet's Bridge I think.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160
Oh right, yes.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.160
That's where we have some really nice shots of you in costume and the rest of it, which is smashing.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.200
And you'd have been dancing to samba drumming?

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.200
Yes, samba drumming.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:57.200
So it was the first time that I'd ever done street dance and also the first time really that I've been involved in something that was dancing to that type of music.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200
So it was really quite exciting.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
And it was a sunny day I think as I remember.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200
Yes, it was a sunny day.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200
So it was great fun.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.200
Did you get involved in the making of the costumes as well or were you primarily about movement?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.240
Yes, I did.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.240
We were down in Cotet's.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.240
In the community centre?

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.240
In the community centre and I vividly remember it.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.240
We were making the costumes and I looked up and there was a rainbow over the camp.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240
So that was a really nice.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.240
A good sign.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.240
We weren't going to be flooded that year.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.240
For those of you with biblical aspirations or connotations.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.240
So after having danced with Sally in a dance group in 98, what happened next?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:49.280
Well, 99 I came to the opening of the carnival of the launch party, which was the first time I'd been to the launch party.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:58.280
And I went in and I spoke to you about possible work.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:06.320
So I came and you had the welcoming committee.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.320
I'm not sure of the job title.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.320
So that's when I was involved on a work basis with the carnival.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.320
Were you being a trainee at that point?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.320
No, no, I was.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.320
You were full time?

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.320
Yes, as the sort of front of house welcoming.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320
Got it.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.320
So as people came in, I'd be.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:37.360
That's a really important position because we're always trying to attract new people and having a welcoming face and a positive attitude, which you'd be glad to know you still possess, is really important.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360
So I can see you.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.360
And in 99, were we at chapter?

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.360
I thought so.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360
Right here.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.360
So we were in what used to be the gym and it's now called the studio.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360
And you're there.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360
I can see it now.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.360
You're there as our.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400
I say receptionist, super receptionist.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400
Let's put it that way.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.400
And it was it was a really nice job because it meant I got to meet everybody that was involved.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.400
A lot of people had not, you know, had not done that.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.400
Did you have to stop anybody escaping or whatever?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400
Let me out of there.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.400
Everybody was really happy to be there and it was it was a lovely sort of creative environment.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.440
And what I especially loved about it was that it was sort of a real fusion of the arts.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:35.440
Like I come from an art background, visual art background, but with the camp, it was a mixture of the music, dance, art and performance.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:44.440
And what really whatever people wanted to do, it was very open and very open for people to bring their own creativity there,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.480
as well as following the sort of more structured.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.480
I think we only had one secret rule, which was no Simpsons.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:00.480
Yeah, it's like, you know, when there is an overarching theme, it's, you know, there's a black piece of paper.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.480
But secretly, it'd be like, I can remember one year going like, OK, whatever we do, we mustn't produce Power Rangers.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.480
It's like, no, it's just not it's just not us, you know.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.520
And given that you are our hostess with the mostest, can you remember?

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.520
Did you get to play costume on the day itself this year?

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.520
I did, yes. Excellent. What were you in that design?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.520
I was I had a blue costume.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.520
I was I was part of the there was the blue people.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.520
I'm not sure what the name of it was, but I did my own thing because I wasn't specifically with that group,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.520
but I had blue paint all over my face and my body.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.560
And I made a kind of blue leather sort of belt with lots of feathers on and a headdress.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.560
Yeah. And and really out of a lot of the scraps of material.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.560
So it was quite, it's not the case that the artists and the workers involved are well, they put themselves last.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.560
So it's only until the last few days and suddenly goes like, whoops, you know, I may have helped facilitate hundreds of costumes.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.560
And so it's like, what am I going to look like on the day?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:10.600
Yeah, no, because because you're not specifically with the section, you know, you've got to go around all all the different groups.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.600
Yes. Running up and down the line.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.600
So just yeah, but those were my colors.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.600
So that's why I wanted to be in that group.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.600
And also it was the the drumming group were with them.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.600
So it was people were dancing and I can't quite remember the name of them.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.600
But it was I think it was an offshoot of run down mental.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640
That's it. Yeah.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.640
Yes. So who's done it for a number of years and yes.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.640
Yeah.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.640
So would you have been holding?

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.640
I was holding something to me.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640
Oh, no, no, I wasn't.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:51.640
Actually, I have my ones, my pink fairy ones because because I started off before I joined the carnival.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.640
I just sort of got a performance piece up and running, which was pink fairy.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.640
Does the pink fairy still exist?

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.680
She hasn't surfaced recently, but yes, she still exists.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.680
Excellent. I can see the ones in my mind's eye.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.680
And then the you had sort of like a mini feather boa wrapped around the right.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:21.680
So it was kind of a cross between a sort of a blue warrior type costume with my pink meets the pink fairy.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.720
Yes.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.720
But I did go in as a pink fairy during one of the carnivals.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:34.720
But I think that was for the Rugby World Cup when we were parades in the streets.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.720
I think before before the game.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.720
Yes, definitely.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.720
And so that's when I you actually pink fairy did big time.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720
Yes.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.720
So after after 1999, what happens next?

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.720
Tell us more about your carnival adventures.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:57.760
Well, after 99, the carnival, my my I had a life changing experience because I met in the carnival,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.760
which is a mix of, you know, Caribbean cultures.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.760
It mixes. It is truly a intercultural experience.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.760
I met the father of my children who's from St. Vincent.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:17.760
Some of the the people running the carnival, some of the people making the costumes and working

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.800
alongside Swicker were there.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:26.800
So I actually had my became a mother as a consequence of the carnival.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.800
What does carnival mean to you?

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800
Motherhood.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800
It's a good answer.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.800
It's a good answer.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:37.800
The way I see it is that really I was kind of a mother figure when I was meeting people in the carnival.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.800
So it's sort of almost led into my role as a mother.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.840
However, I did continue with the carnival and I brought my children along there.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:57.840
Even there was one carnival when Rose, my daughter, was a couple of months old and I had her in my,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.840
you know, my little papoose in during the carnival.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.840
So I just integrated life.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.840
I think that's the great thing about the carnival.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.840
It is very much an all inclusive family event.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.880
So it didn't disclude me because I was, which often happens when you're in the creative industries,

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.880
is that it's very much not family or child friendly.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.880
So that was the great thing about it for me anyway.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.880
So I could continue.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:35.880
I didn't I didn't work in the carnival, but I always brought my children and they got involved in the culture of.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.880
Literally carnival babies.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.880
Yes, they were carnival babies.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.920
Which is lovely, yes.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.920
I think that's fantastic.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.920
Could you say a little bit about, so obviously, yeah, carnival is something we share.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:56.920
Perhaps a bit about your arts practice, because I associate you with lots of interesting, exciting and spiritual things.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.920
That's right, yes.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.920
For future generations.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.920
In fact, as I was thinking of what the carnival meant to me,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.920
I did think that there is a certain amount of spiritual elements of the carnival as well.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:18.960
Because I felt that the whole drumming aspect of it is is is can draw parallels with with quite shamanic work

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.960
and especially the tradition of going through the streets and the night before the carnival.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.960
The juve, the poor man's carnival.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.960
Yes, well, I think that.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.960
So if I say, you know me well, jab jab.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.960
No, no, sorry, let's get it right.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.960
I come from hell.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.960
Jab jab.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
You know me well.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Jab jab.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I come from hell.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Jab jab.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Sorry, simple but effective.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And that tradition is to clear out any of the bad spirits the night before the carnival.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And so, like for me, I'm the work I do is quite I'm an artist.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I done my masters just before in 98.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I finished that.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So 99 being the first the year I joined or 98 this year, I joined the carnival.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.040
I'm a painter is the practice I'm doing at the moment.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.040
I use a studio at home.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.040
Yes, I did last year.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.040
And the light at Portcaul, the light.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.040
Yes, it's the same night as the South Wales.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.040
I'm making this up.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.040
The light is very good.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.040
Yeah, it is.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.040
It is.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:31.040
It's I was living in Cardiff at the time of the carnival, but I moved to Portcaul, which is my hometown.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.040
And it's beautiful.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:39.080
I sort of use that sort of, you know, the nature around as part of it to influence my work.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:50.080
But I also do beach art and I go into the environment to create artworks, land art, beach art, land art,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.080
go into schools, doing sort of willow projects.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.080
And also.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.120
And also.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:06.120
That means you're aware of one of the regular company jokes, which is another word for willows is, of course, with these.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.120
Why are they called with these?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.120
Because with these we're going to make something.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.120
Have I never used that?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.120
No, you never heard.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.120
I hear I gift you that rather sad joke.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120
I'll remember that.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.120
Don't think you ever have to use it.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.120
I mean, you know.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120
Sorry.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:28.160
No, so I so it also combines my artwork when I'm doing, say, beach art.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:42.160
I started that in 2010 with the residents I had on Coney Beach, which is sort of a it's probably not the most spiritual place you'd think of.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:52.200
But I decided to take up the challenge of making Coney Beach, which is right by the fairground, right by Treco Bay, very, very public beach.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:58.200
And there's a lot of litter that tends to be like a bit of donkey droppings and donkey droppings and everything in the summer.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:10.200
And I decided to have a month to a month's residency there and visit the beach every single day, do a kind of beach clean and take personal responsibility for the environment,

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:21.240
taking care of the environment and creating a kind of spiritual connection, sacred connection with that space to see if I could change the energy of what was already there.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:31.240
Not that there was anything wrong with the energy there, but I mean just that whole sort of environmental and just just being in nature.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:45.280
Because usually I would go somewhere quite remote, such as Scare and make where I've got my own sort of stone circle and I go and it's very much conducive to some way you would more like liken to a sacred space.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:51.280
Whereas Coney Beach is not in public view, so it's kind of for me it was a bit of a coming out of not.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.280
What was the public reaction to finding you doing this?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.280
Because there you were accessible, aren't you?

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:10.320
Yeah, yeah, well, that's the whole point is because is to be to be visible, picking up rubbish, inviting people to come along to pick up rubbish, but also to invite people to make artwork on the beach.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.360
And you know, and then it wasn't obviously a spiritual act.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.360
It was more because sort of the intention was there that that's what I was doing.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:26.360
I was I was connecting with that environment to improve the environment and to connect with people that were there.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:32.360
But in actual fact, the last day that I was there, it was on 31st of August.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.360
There is a crowds come to see the firework display because it's seaside town.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:46.400
And in fact, I started to make lanterns and that was the first time it would probably be maybe a little bit more spiritual in looking.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:15:01.400
And there's big crowds of people came up that teenagers not not really anybody asked for 15, 16 year olds that were hanging around with nothing to do other than wait for the fireworks to happen.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:08.440
And so they came around and they were kind of getting involved and and one person said, oh, my gosh, I can't believe we're on Coney Beach.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.440
It's totally different. It's like being in another place.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.440
So for me, it worked. It's transformative arts, isn't it?

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:28.440
Yes, it's the power of it, which brings us full circle, because that's certainly one of the ways in which I like to think of of carnival arts is it's that whole the world turned upside down.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.480
Even if you know, yes, nine tenths of it is, as you pointed out, at the carnival camp.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:44.480
But for one day in the year, you know, you've got you have the Lord of Mist rule gives his or her powers to us all to to transgress and to what can I say?

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.480
You know, well, just turn the normal everyday order upside down.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.520
Absolutely. I think it does.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:16:04.520
I think, you know, it's it's not about people being trained or people being professionals or people being having to be a certain type of person to be involved.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.520
It does give everybody a chance.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.520
It's one of the few art forms which I feel is genuinely accessible.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.520
It is very inclusive.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.520
And it even includes people who don't want to make the art.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:26.560
I mean, it's like this year we were at Fitz Allen and then there were some boys who were brought there as part of family groups by their mums and they played football outside and then they perhaps come in and have a drink or whatever.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.560
And that's fine, too.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.560
There's no right or wrong with carnival.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.560
I find it's not prescriptive, is it?

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.560
Nobody's going, you have to do the following.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.560
No, there's only one road to follow.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:52.600
And I think that transformative thing is very evident because you can have people that's coming in that are very shy, very introvert or very they don't want to be sent to attention, but they get caught up in the whole energy.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:17:10.640
And as they see their friends or their groups transformed, then it sort of it brings them out of themselves and it puts them into a place where they can experiment and they can try something out that they wouldn't normally do.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.640
Absolutely.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:22.680
And I think the duration of the camp, because it lasts three weeks, people could come in and be quite sort of objective about it and stand back.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:47.720
But I think by the time it finishes, you can't help but get involved and even if they thought they wouldn't, I think it just it really brings people out, which is a great sort of self empowering tool that happens quite naturally without forcing people to be creative or to be to be to be part of something.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.720
So pleased that this interview took place.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.720
I thank you for your eloquence.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.720
And whilst it's invisible and it's yes, it's still eternal.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.720
I hereby award you, Siobhan Grace, the title of Cardiff Carnival Queen.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720
Thank you so much.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720
Thank you, Steve.
