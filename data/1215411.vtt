00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880
But when I go into a relationship or friendship with someone who doesn't have a disability,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.320
how would they react when I do tell them that I do have a disability?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:27.880
And that's what I'm afraid of, is once I tell them, I won't hear anything from them.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.520
And that's what I am worried about.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.400
Is it something you have been telling people at the moment or not?

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:44.200
I don't know what to do because I want to tell them and I know if I do,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:52.720
that again they'll probably say, we don't, it's not worth it.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:03.320
But I suppose if I tell them that I have a disability as well, that I'm telling the truth.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:17.120
So, if maybe I don't say anything about my disability, how would that work?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:25.960
Would that be lying or just not maintaining it because you want to put yourself out there

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:36.480
with getting relationships and friendships and I really don't know what to do.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:48.040
It's something that I would like to look into but not sure how to go about it.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.600
Do you know anyone else who's on these dating sites?

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.600
No.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.880
And where did you hear about the dating sites?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.440
I've just looked online, just dating sites.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.360
That's it.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.400
Nothing more.
