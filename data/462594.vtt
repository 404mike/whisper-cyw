00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
I listen to the games on a Saturday afternoon and iron the sheets.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:17.240
Very good for ironing bed linen is a good rugby match, especially with a good commentator.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:34.080
My husband and my father had one, two, three, four, five, so possibly with four other mates,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:45.080
followed the matches, went to Cardiff, went to Scotland.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.720
I can't remember if they went to Ireland.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.280
They certainly watched the English match.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:13.280
Golden Age Welsh rugby, and what I remember is a member of the French team, a big, born Frenchman.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.280
But our lot were better than them.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.280
Yes, so I followed the rugby very closely.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:37.280
My son used to go down to my parents' home, Gwynfrin Village, a triangle of lanes.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.280
We lived on the back of the triangle, my husband and I and the children.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:59.280
My mother-in-law lived on the top side of the triangle, and my mother and father lived on the lower side of the triangle.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.280
Nobody could see each other's front or back doors.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.280
Weren't we lucky?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:23.280
Yes, so my son used to go down the lane to my dad's, and they would watch the rugby together.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.280
I remember he was very young at the time, was my lad, and coming home one day and saying,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.280
It was a very good game, and the man kept talking to us all the time, saying, Gareth, Edward, Gareth, Edward!
