00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It should be recording now.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yes, it's making, making, making signs of recording.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Oops.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Hello.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Hello.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.800
Well, I think, yes, it's still recording.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.240
It's just gone dull.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.040
So this is Jim Barrett interviewing Stuart McCarty at his home on the 23rd of January

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.040
2018.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.360
Stuart has signed the project consent form.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.040
This interview is being recorded for Wunderbras 25 project funded by HLF Cymru.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.720
Right, Stuart, so how did you first hear about Wunderbras?

00:00:50.720 --> 00:01:02.800
I met Richard Evans at the Gmorgan Jazz summer school and then I saw Wunderbras play in the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.800
evening.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.760
And what was your impression of Wunderbras?

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.920
I thought it looked like a very exciting band and you just didn't see, you just don't see

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.480
bands that big anymore.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.280
It was just like big and bold and brassy.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.720
It was right up my street.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.720
Big, bold, brassy and brash.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.720
Yeah.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720
Right.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:42.440
But in that mix, there was also some very good players and some really nice improvising

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.120
in that mix as well.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.880
So how long had you been playing before you actually did Wunderbras?

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.880
No.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
Or joined Wunderbras?

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.000
Probably about 15 years.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.720
Do you play anything other than saxophone or was saxophone your first instrument?

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.720
No, I just play saxophone.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.560
Okay, so how did you start playing the saxophone?

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:27.040
I played clarinet at school and I really liked it but I'm dyslexic so reading music was always

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.560
a huge struggle for me.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.840
And so I was learning at school off written music and when I went home I used to go home

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.040
and practice by improvising and trying to work things out by ear instead of reading

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.280
the music.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.640
Because there was no place for that in the school I went to, I only did it for about

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.600
three years and then I stopped playing.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.200
And then I joined the army.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.400
When I left the army, I met an old friend of mine, I've known since I was five, who

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.240
was in a new wave band.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.520
And he said, you used to play clarinet didn't you?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.760
And I said yeah and he said well do you want to be in a band?

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.480
But you should probably play saxophone.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.400
So I went and bought a saxophone and was in a band.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.480
I thought I did book a few lessons with a guy called Mark Buckingham.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.400
So I had about a year of lessons from Mark to get the basics and then I've had little

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.880
bits of lessons on and off but mostly self taught.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.840
Was it always tenor sax or did you play any other exercise?

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.440
I have flirted with, I had a, I used to play a, what were those plastic saxophones called?

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:14.040
Grafden, I used to play a grafden alto and I did play with, I did have a soprano at one

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.440
point as well.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.620
But what I found is all that did is double your practice because unless you practice

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.500
on both, when you were playing out, changing over is difficult then.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:39.660
And I just didn't have the time to do that much practice so I just concentrated on tenor.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.220
And I've sold the others now.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.260
It's always been my favourite to tell you the truth of all the saxophones.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:58.980
It's always been tenor for me except for Eric Dolphy who's the only alto player who gets

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:06.860
in my path and on of tenor players.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:16.260
Maybe Cannonball Adley on a good night.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:24.540
And are there any particularly memorable occasions with Wunderbras playing with Wunderbras?

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.060
Oh, there were quite a few.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.860
I've always said about Wunderbras, I've played some of the best gigs I've ever played with

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.340
Wunderbras but I've also played some of the worst.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:50.220
And then we used to play a lot of street gigs and smaller gigs and we had the mini bus and

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.140
not many people could make it and you were sections short and you turn up and you go

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.420
oh no this is awful and just have to struggle through.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:09.740
So I remember a few of those but then I remember playing at the Fuse Festival to 2,000 people

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.300
that was fantastic.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:21.860
I also remember a great gig the first time we played on stage at Brecon and there weren't

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:29.460
many people in the audience and so the band decided to get off the stage and dance and

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.500
I think we were playing El Watuzzi and the rhythm section just carried on but then they

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.060
got to the part where it was my solo so I jumped back on stage in solo and people wouldn't

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.340
come back and I must have done 30 choruses running out of breath going please come back

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:55.660
30 choruses I'm running out of stuff to play now.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.380
So that was a very memorable gig for me.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.500
And then what other ones do I remember?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:12.380
Oh and then I don't think I ever travelled abroad with Wonder Brass with all the things

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:18.300
they've done abroad I don't think I ever went abroad with Wonder Brass.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:24.460
How many Brecons do you think you did?

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.500
I think I was involved with Wonder Brass for 10 years and I went every year so I must have

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.220
done about 9 or 10 something like that.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.660
That's a long time with the band.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:45.620
And I was in the band when we used to so I did that transition from playing on the street

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:53.540
at Brecon to being on the stage with other people like those were great gigs the Amapundo

00:07:53.620 --> 00:08:03.380
gigs the gigs with Claude and Jason Yard those were oh they were really challenging but amazing

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.060
what a learning experience they were as well.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.700
So those project gigs were really really good.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:21.460
And you know I never thought I'd play at Brecon Jazz Festival never ever in a million years.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:29.060
So that was Brecon was always the high point of the year for me really because you got

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:34.060
to play and then you got to go and see your heroes afterwards.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.060
Yes.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.060
And for free.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:43.460
And as many of them as you liked it was fantastic.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.580
It was good yes it was very good.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.700
And since Wonder Brass what have you been doing since?

00:08:52.700 --> 00:09:02.020
I've been going to jam sessions on and off since I left Wonder Brass and I'm now playing

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:07.020
a blues band.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:14.220
Which is interesting because it means I have to know stuff because I'm the only horn player

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.980
and with Wonder Brass if you didn't quite know something you could probably just not

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.980
play.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:29.500
Because there'd be another three tenor players you know and if there was a bit was tricky

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.660
you didn't know you just didn't play.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:41.140
Now I've got to play all the time.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:47.420
Do you think Wonder Brass enabled you to do things musically that you know otherwise

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.420
wouldn't have done?

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.420
Oh yeah absolutely yeah I mean done some amazing stuff.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.420
As I said there was who's that is that Gaynor?

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.300
How'd you get in?

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.300
Was the front door open?

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.300
Oh dear.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.300
Hello matey.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.300
I'm being interviewed.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.300
Four.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.300
About Wonder Brass.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.460
Wonder Brass.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.460
Cheeky.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:24.460
Okay and you know this sort of Wonder Brass 25 years.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.180
Do you want to get involved with that?

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.580
Would you like to get anything particular out of that?

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.180
I would like to get involved with that.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:42.900
I mean I would say I did try to join Wonder Brass again but during the time I'd left there

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:49.420
were many more people who would read music and I just couldn't I have to learn everything

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:56.340
by rote so I know it by rote and I just didn't have the time because instead of when I joined

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.420
there were many people couldn't read so we used to spend a long time learning a new piece

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:07.700
and now it's a couple of weeks and it's done and it just meant I was getting further and

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:15.780
further behind and yeah you know which was a shame because I do enjoy playing with Wonder

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:22.300
Brass but I've always I only learn the tune so I can improvise on it.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:27.300
If I don't want to improvise on a tune I won't bother learning it.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:39.500
Okay well I'm sure we can you know I'm sure we can there's plenty of tunes that we can

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:44.300
do that you would still remember so I'm sure we can sort out something.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.300
Yeah yeah.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.300
For the project.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.300
That'll be good.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.300
Yeah.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.300
Okay.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.700
It'll be nice to meet Nick and Claude again yeah as well.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.220
Yeah yeah.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.700
Okay great thanks Stuart thank you very much.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.700
Thanks Brian.
