00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
While the tempest still is nigh, I need no right sake

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Till the storm of life is passed, Take it to the great world kind

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Oh, receive my soul at last

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Best in the light may I think, In the darkness, silent boy

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Trouble now I know no sleep, But the best boy the world boy

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:49.000
In the hopes of the good sleep, Lest there I must or a prayer

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Of the one who believed me, Lest he fall in my last sleep

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Come, my heart, and do me voice, Long to dream in fair night one

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Sleep in the good hour of voice, Heal the blood of the wronged one

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Come, my heart, and do me voice, Long to dream in fair night one

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Sleep in the good hour of voice, Heal the blood of the wronged one
