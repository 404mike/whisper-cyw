00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
We got there, and there were no signs of anything at all.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.200
It was just an area, a small lane leaning off into a wood.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.400
But 50 yards down that little cutting, there was a German sentry box,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:29.200
the blackened red and white stripe, with a lift pole, and a Hungarian soldier.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, we were told later he was Hungarian, funny looking soldier,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in a saw sand uniform, putties, and a rifle slung across his back.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He just lifted the pole and waved us through.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.200
We went, and my two SS went through the gate, into the camp proper,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.000
and it was something which, a sight that I will never forget.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:02.000
I think first of all, it was just a series of high barbed wire fences,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
huts on the left-hand side.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.600
There were bundles all over the main concourse, which was just dry earth,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.200
there was no grass anywhere.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.800
There were just bundles, looked like rags, but turned out to be dead inmates.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.800
We were told, referred to the inmates as DPs, displaced persons.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.800
We had no knowledge who they were, where they came from, nationality, sex, or religion.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.800
And as we went in further, then the stench of the whole place came at me,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.400
coupled with the fact that there was an Astrid Hayes hanging over camp,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.400
formed from the inmates setting fire to their straw palaces,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.000
and wooden floorboards, anything they could make to burn.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And it seemed to hang as a haze over the whole camp.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
There were inmates or DPs hanging on the wires,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
fallen beside it, grotesque positions,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.200
and you just had to pick your way through them.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.200
Two were walking and came towards us, and the SS, my escort, just shot them.
