00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
One Christmas was so much like another that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There were postmen at Christmas too, with sparkling eyes and wooden chariot noses on spread, frozen feet.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
They crunched up to the doors and mittened on them manfully.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But all that the children could hear was the ringing of bells.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I mean that the bells that the children could hear were inside them.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There were church bells too, in the bat-black snow-white belfries, tugged by bishops and storks.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And they rang their tidings over the bandaged town, over the frozen foam of the powder and the ice-cream hills, over the crackling sea.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It seemed that all the church boomed for joy under my window, and the weathercocks crewed for Christmas on our fence.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The postmen were just ordinary postmen, fond of walking and dogs and Christmas and the snow.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
They knocked on the doors with blue knuckles, and then they stood on the white welcome mat in the little drifted porches,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and huffed and puffed, making ghosts with their breath, and jogged from foot to foot, like small boys wanting to go out.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And the cold postman, with a rose on his button nose, tingled down in a tea tray slithered run of the chilly, glinting hill.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
He went in his ice-bound boots like a man on fishermen's slabs.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:13.000
He wagged his back like a frozen camel's hump, dizzy and turned the corner in one foot, and by God, he was gone.
