Around the Bridge Street area from my recollections there was the Watchmakers who were just before

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.200
M.A. Rapport & Company. After Rapport was J.Bros which was the Jacob Brothers which was

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.200
Cecil Rapport's uncles and they lived in Cathedral Road and they had a hosiery company,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.840
cloth company. Then there was Norman Cohen's business but I've forgotten what it was. He

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.040
was just further along. Further along Bridge Street after the butcher shop was Glickers.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.520
Glickers was another toy wholesaler, Max Glicker. Further up the road was Salomon's,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.360
the delicatessen, Wally's. Around the corner was the Army and Navy stores which was Motel Boom.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.840
On the other side of the road near the butchers was Gormans, the Fishmongers. Around the corner

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.000
was Weesbards, the hardware store that was in Frederick Street. Further up Frederick Street

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.440
was the shoe wholesaler, Goldblatz, the shoe wholesaler. Opposite Goldblatz was Bernard and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.320
Mark E.K., the other butchers. I left somebody out in Bridge Street was Gabbers. Gabbers was another

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.560
wholesaler. Then I can't think of many more but there was lots of them in that area.
