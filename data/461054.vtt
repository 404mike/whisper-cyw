I went to see Robert Jones, the scrum half, in a businessman's lunch in Paltn Frithes just before Christmas.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I went up to Robert after the match and I said, you know, there's one thing better than rugby.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And he looked at me and he said, what's that? I said, talking about it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I said, because the talking about it and the stories, I think, are absolutely brilliant.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And that's the same with all sport. I love tuning in for the football on 606 on a Saturday evening

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to listen to the people giving their opinions and people phoning in and giving their opinions

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and the commentators replying to it. And that's part of it with sport, the stories.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I'm not sure all the stories are accurate after 20 years or 30 years.
