00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Well, I didn't have Betty Journey to help me out every day, but I've talked to Betty on many occasions.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And most of the time I'm talking to Gwen Davies Helm, who can't be here today,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but she's filled my little head with all sorts of visions.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then of course there's Hugh Perry, and he says to me, he goes, I'll tell you a story.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But of course it's not the sort of thing you're going to say in front of everybody in the church.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Remember that. You're going to get me in trouble.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So I won't tell you Hugh Perry's story, but I did write a poem.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I had so much trouble writing this poem, it was sort of like giving birth to twins.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But I'm really not even sure if I finished it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But I hope Betty and everybody else who was in this church, I hope it's okay.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I couldn't come up with a fancy title, so I just put Seattle's Old Welsh Church at the top.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let's see if it works, okay?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
There's nothing there where the heart once stood, nothing but a sharp stucco box rising rudely,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
flush against the sidewalk intruding.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There's no way to tell where the steps used to be, no sacred bit of earth to stand on.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It was meant to be our legacy, a home for us to hand on.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Remember, we all came together there to bear witness to Christenings, marriages, and deaths.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Too untimely to bear alone. Of course we sang on Sundays, and for all the critical moments,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
music welled up from the depths, washed over us, and reverberated into the city streets.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It brought us together, cleansed our bitterness and pain, and for a time,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
like an unruly current, tore us apart. But all the same, it carried us.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Every year Welsh pilgrims came in a greyhound bus hired from Vancouver, Renton, and Elmira,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Spokane and Black Diamond, an instant choir.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Croissant, Mr. Thomas! Hello, Mr. Jones! Handshakes around, eyes on fire.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Hello, Mr. Parry! Have you seen Mr. Pritchard? Do you remember my friend?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Then one deep, rolling thunder struck. Amen. A gaman vagani has begun.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Songs of praises I will ever give to thee echoed in the moving part to feed the soul and touch the heart.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
A great baptism through immersion in this blended harmony.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Then downstairs the tables white, a feast of ham, cakes, and cups of tea,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and everything a lovely sight to feed this Cumbric family.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Some of us married and moved away. Death and indifference took its toll.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But we always expected the church to stay.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It had married us, carried us, and buried us. It was the sun our universe went round.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The guardian of our Cambrian sound.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
A place to heal here I snagging pain, a shelter from the winter rain,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
where God's great spirit lived within to comfort us and sponge our sin.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Then behind closed doors in other places from strangers' mouths on strangers' faces,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
they said it's really not a church at all. It's an ethnic playground past its prime.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The pews sit half empty all the time. It's just a steepled stained glass social hall.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Then a scratching pen declared its fate. It's just a piece of real estate.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
But all those who lived both far and near remembered then the joyful noise,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
the bronze plaque tribute to our boys that died in the Great War.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Remember the organ full of praise, the great steaming pots of tea, daffodils, china, and silver trays.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And remembered our Cumbric community.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
There was Mr. Pritchard and Mrs. Hughes. And all the faces that filled the pews.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The strolling chorus walking home. The sweet, full, and heartfelt tone.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
If there is power in remembering and words can let you see through the stucco boxes to know,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000
there still remains, despite the pen and the wrecking ball, a Seattle Cumbric community.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Thank you.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Applause
