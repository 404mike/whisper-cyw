What are your first memories of television, June?

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.000
The Queen's coronation, 1953.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And where were you living at that time?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Well, actually I was living with my mother-in-law and father-in-law,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and there was a television installed in Logan School, the old Logan School,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
a very, very small TV.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And we were in this big school room, just watching parts of the coronation then.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That's the first time I really sat down and watched television.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So were you a pupil in the school?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
No, my husband was.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But because we were living in Llynconna, all the residents were invited to go.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Raymond didn't go because he was painting the little house where we were moving to.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But you went?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Yeah, June the 2nd, 1953, which was my birthday.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Very fitting then, celebration.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So you saw that first television with a crowd of other people.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Yes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What do you remember of the atmosphere?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Everybody was cheering when the crown was actually put on her head.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But I think everybody was more impressed with Queen Silotti of Tonga,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
because she poured with rain, and she was the only one that drove in the possession in an open carriage,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and carrying a big umbrella, because she was a rather bigish lady.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But I think the impact in that room that day, they were looking at her once the Queen had gone by,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and this lady was waving and smiling and the rain just pouring down.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
She did give an impact to the people.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So you remember vividly her and her carriage.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Oh yes, open carriage.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
What else, what other images that you've got in your mind from that day?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Well it is amazing to see in the mall, on the telly, how many people slept out overnight,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to that they have a prime spot on the time of the possessions.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
There was the Golden Coach, and she went from the palace in the Golden Coach,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and they actually had, at that time, they had a top hit with a record.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
There's a Golden Coach, and it was about the Queen riding in the Golden Coach,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000
going to her coronation, and it was top of the, like top of the pops, if you like, for months and months and months.
