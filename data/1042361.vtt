While the nearer waters roll, while the dead that still is wide,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:36.580
My dear child,

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:43.580
I know the world is hard.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.580
I'll drive it down in the wind,

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.580
and destroy it all.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.580
Yet my daily woes

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.580
with anguish cancels.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.580
Coils fall from the riverside

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.580
slithering upon the shore.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.580
People get disappointed

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:16.940
as the native sea

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.580
dwells after that lake.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.580
I'm not going to be able to win.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:28.580
My heart will be on this shore.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.580
I'm going to be able to win.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:38.580
My heart will be on this shore.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:44.580
I'm going to be able to win.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.580
But heart is vain like to be dead.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.580
She'll live her still and healing.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:59.580
Have my body's wedding with sorrow for you.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.580
I'll send Mary into my city.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:08.580
Please come out of the spinal meeting.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.580
Then cease my heartless beating.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:19.580
I'll soon turn death for you.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:24.580
Who'd find a friend as they had?

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:29.580
Who's right, come fight, come back.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.580
Who'd find a friend as they had?

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:38.580
It's the one who can't ever win.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:43.580
One night I'll go round to the coast part.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:49.580
I'll come over for fish that are really short.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:54.580
One night I'll go round to the coast part.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:00.580
I'm going to your place.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:31.580
And be the peace in our momentary owing.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:45.580
The gentle peace that came through the land's foe.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:20:00.580
And from the cross on with the nursing king.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:15.580
Against my soul may Jesus come with his soul.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:30.580
Who even here never will be downpoured.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:46.580
Here below is my eternal, my cross.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:21:04.580
And from the cross on with the nursing king.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:21.580
My cross will never be seen through the night.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:37.580
Oh, bring her in, our worthy and kind home.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:54.580
Hail, hail, O hail, that we are near your home.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:10.580
Under your roof, all hail thy fatherly home.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:27.580
I bow and we are yet to see you again.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:43.580
Hail, O hail, the story of the sacrifice.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:56.580
On the cross of Calvary, when the Savior died.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:09.580
Round the grave we hear, O God, we have never heard.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:24.580
Round we're calling thee home, O redemption's birth.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:37.580

When the Savior died, all your joys will be.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:25:04.580
O, bring her in, our worthy and kind home.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:23.580
Hail, hail, O hail, that we are near your home.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:53.580
Send thy spirit, my peace-seeking, Gracious voice and quiet rain.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:26:06.580
Send the God-forsaken teaching, I be heavenly in thy way.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:51.580
Hail, hail, O hail, O hail, that we are near your home.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:34.580
Round the grave we hear, O God, we have never heard.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:49.580
Round we're calling thee home, O redemption's birth.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:28:01.580
Hail, hail, O hail, that we are near your home.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:16.580

I am the old, I'm the great, I call on will and do this barren land.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:17.580
I am free, but love I'm fighting, only with my humble hand.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:30.580
Strong the earth, strong the earth, lead us in thy strength and cheer.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:40.580
Lead us in thy strength and cheer.
