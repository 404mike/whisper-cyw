00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I went to the state school and that didn't work out very well because I was, I couldn't speak English.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I was teased mercilessly.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You know, they would call me names. Jerry was the favourite one because of course the war had just started

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and they would run around pretending to be airplanes as little children did in those days with arms outstretched, making noises.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And I was always the Messerschmitt which got shot at.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Anyway, it wasn't very pleasant. The fact that I couldn't speak a word of English of course and no effort was really made to include me in the lessons.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So every day at break time at 10 o'clock I sneaked out through the gate and ran home.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And this went on for three or four months apparently until, well nobody missed me for a start.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But I was called by my father's sister, my aunt, who came to visit my mother unexpectedly and found me sitting on the railway, bang-banging, watching the trains.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And of course she told my mother and that was the first intimation that my mother had that something had gone wrong at school.
