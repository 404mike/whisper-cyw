00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What about relationship wise?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.800
No, I can't see that happening.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.280
I think for me it would just be me.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.480
I've always wanted two dogs.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.200
My, well, maybe pushing three.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.160
I've always said I would love to have a Pitbull,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.840
a Rottweiler and a Husky.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.440
They are my three breeds I've always wanted to have.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.520
Because a lot of people say that,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.480
oh, you shouldn't have a Pitbull,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.320
you should have a Rottweiler

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.200
because you know, they're aggressive.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.800
But I think it's the way they brought up.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.080
It's the way that the owners are.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.440
It's nothing to do with the dog.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.720
It's the way that they've been brought up, that's all.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.440
Yeah, three dogs, five bedroom hosts,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.840
managing your own world, doing social media.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.160
Just you and the dogs?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.520
Yeah, that's me.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.360
And a partner?

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.680
Nope.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.520
I'm interested.
