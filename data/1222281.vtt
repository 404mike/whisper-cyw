00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
And then you've been asked to write an article about your mother's brother, yeah?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.680
Yes, he was widely travelled.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.040
What was his name?

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.480
His name was Rudolph Stubble, but he didn't like the name Rudolph.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.160
I think people made fun of it.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.480
So he called himself Dick, which is short for Richard,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.720
which is my name.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:43.440
So what happened with him was he grew up in Pontacama and then he was sent off to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.960
London to be educated. I don't know the story behind that.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:57.440
He qualified as a doctor and went off to the South Pacific, to Fiji, to become a district

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:07.360
medical officer. He travelled throughout the Middle East. He came back to this country.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.800
He did his FRCS in Edinburgh.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.360
He did his FRCS in Edinburgh.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.840
Then did general practice in London.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.560
And when the war broke out, he joined up and he served in North Africa, where he was captured

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.800
at the siege of Tobruk. He escaped from prisoner of war camp and nearly made it

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.320
to Switzerland, but was captured on the border.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.160
He escaped again and was caught. And when Italy surrendered in 1943,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.400
he wasn't in the southern part of Italy, he was in the northern part where the Germans were,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.040
and they were taking him to prisoner of war camp somewhere and he escaped from that.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.800
And he could have made it back to Allied lines, but he heard that the partisans in the Yugoslav

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:23.200
mountains needed medical help. So he went there and ran field hospitals and the Germans bombed

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.160
one of them and he was caught in a blast and suffered injuries from which he died.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.600
We've got letters in the files to describe what sort of person he was and how he looked after the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:46.160
partisans. So you wrote an article about this for Bimmer? Yes, I did. What was the origin? How did

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:55.520
you come to write the article? I had a letter from a social historian in Oxford who had, he'd put an

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:04.480
advert in the Jewish Chronicle. He was doing research into what medical officers did in the war

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.160
and a relative of mine in London got hold of him and put him in touch with my aunt who lived in

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:20.800
Bournemouth, that was the widow of my father's younger brother, and from there he got put in

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:30.640
touch with me. So you helped fill in that part of the story? Yes, yes. And also produced the article as well? That's right.
