00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Be seated, yes.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Did you have the bag?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
No, we have the bag.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We have the bag.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Not for the foundation thinking.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In the sixth century,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
whale, the figure of St. David,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
moves mysteriously

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and throughout a complex mixture

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of saints, scholars, sailors,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
settlers,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
princes and pirates.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
As with King Arthur, little is known of St. David,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
except what knowledge

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
derives from folklore.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What really matters is that

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
there existed a man who gave whales

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
an example of holy living,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which inspired

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
his fellow missionaries and earned him

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the special honor of patron saint,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
a man who was supposed to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
have been born of St. Non,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
founded monasteries

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and awed a synod of kings

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
with his oratory.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
His last words, it is claimed,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
were,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I have the welch, but I think I'll do it in English,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
says,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Persevere in those things

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
which you have learned from me

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and have seen in me.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There is a welch folk song

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
called St. David's Day.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It tells of the enemy trying to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
mislead the welch

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
with a mode of dress

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
who wore the leek as a distinguishing

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
sign.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
A king named Cadwallan

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
referred to in a poem was

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
King of North Wales

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
about 603.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
He waged continual war

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
against the Saxons

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
using the leek for positive

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
identification.
