00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It was just one of the many little things. I wouldn't be as sharp as that today, but in those days I was sharp.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I was even on the money program, BBC Two, at two years running.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Alice at the time was a producer. I still got the discs.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They invited me on the money program.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I remember there was a lunch at the Angel Hotel,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
five or six other industrialists. I don't know what the whole conversation was.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
A real fuddy-duddy, horn-rimmed glasses, professional, you know, managing directors.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And I thought no more about it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Then a week later I get a phone call from the producer,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
oh look, we'd like you to come on.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So they did a program about Welsh industry, I suppose. I don't know.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But about a third of the program was about me.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
They followed me everywhere, going around in business.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And graphs of me and my Rolls-Royce. They even took pictures and they even took filming in my house.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Then a year later they invited me back again for some discussion.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I went, but then they kept inviting me every year,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but I was always away in a far-reaching business and I never bothered anymore.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But that was interesting. I was right on top of the world in those days.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That was just when I finished with the string business.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I was very high with the import business, money program.
