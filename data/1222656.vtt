00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
She was highly involved in Soviet Jews. There was a group called the Women's 35 Group, which was run out of London.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.400
In the early 70s, that was a time when communism was starting to break down in Russia,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.600
and there was a group of Jewish people, they became much more active in their Jewishness, in their Jewish activities.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.200
They applied to leave to Russia, and immediately, as soon as they applied to leave Russia,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.000
they lost their Russian status, citizenship, and everything, and they were called refuseniks.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.600
I remember working in the house, and there were various families who were in touch with us.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.400
There was a family called Vladimir Slepak, I remember, and we actually met him at a later stage.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.400
And my mother used to have telephone conversations, which were all recorded on, nothing sophisticated,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.000
your digital recording equipment, but an old-fashioned tape recorder, and they used to have conversations,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.400
and I remember it going all of a sudden halfway through the conversation, if you'd mentioned a word,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.800
the telephone would be cut off, and it'd be clicked, and you'd hear the click on the telephone,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.000
and also the clickers when it was being listened to, and lots of things were done in code.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.600
She organised lots of demonstrations.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.000
I remember as a child that there used to be a race around Britain, a cycle race called the Milk Race,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.200
where cyclists used to ride around Britain, and there was always a Russian contingent on that.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.200
And I remember as a child, a friend of mine called Simon Cohen, and we had a banner,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.200
which was a huge banner, which was about two foot tall, which was concertinaed, and I kept it at my side.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.200
I walked, and Simon and I walked to the front of the race, literally as the race was about to begin,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.400
and Simon's an end, and I just walked across, and we actually held a banner across the race,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.200
which we made all over the newspaper headlines, we stopped the race for five minutes, and it said,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.800
Free Soviet Jury.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.200
Another famous story is that Stephen Hamilton's father, Leslie, was a doctor for Cardiff City Football Club.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.600
Cardiff City Football Club was a very successful club in the late 70s, and they had a match once in the,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.000
I think it was the Cup Winners Cup, as it was called there, against a team called Dynamo Tbilisi.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.200
Stephen's father, Leslie, was a doctor for Cardiff City Football Club.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.200
When they went over there, they took over two team kits.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.000
They were two team bags, or two boxes of team, and they had, my late mother had been in touch with two brothers,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.800
I cannot remember their name, brothers who were in Tbilisi, and they smuggled in the second kit bag,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.400
it was full of jeans and contraband goods.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.200
The Cardiff City Football Team, I suppose I should be saying this, but they ended up in taking part in these activities,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.200
and when Leslie got to Russia, he handed over these goods, and because in those days,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.200
one of the best forms of currency was actually denim jeans, and they were able to convert that into money,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.600
and they smuggled it over, I remember to this day, I can't remember the brothers' names, they got it, and they were so thankful about it.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.000
I actually followed my late mother's footsteps, and I also became very much involved in Soviet Jury,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.800
and even when I was 18, 19 here, I disrupted many a conference to the extent that there was a conference,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.800
there was the Moscow State Ballet performed at Dominion Theatre in Tottenham Court Road,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:09.000
and I, with a group of friends, we disrupted the concert, we were on the stage, it was actually broadcast live on BBC Radio,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and my parents were there, I was engaged, my wife wasn't married, no mobile telephones, my mother was, and it was a broad,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000
it was at 9 o'clock, the news was interrupted, the 9 o'clock news was interrupted to say there had just been a protest at the Moscow State Ballet,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and there had been a protest by the youngsters of the Soviet Jury, and two protestors had been arrested, and two protestors were hospitalized,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and my mother didn't know which, and she said, I'm sure Adrian's one, I just hope he's not either arrested or in hospital,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I was actually hospitalized because I was knocked unconscious by the KGB that night for my troubles,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
so that was my trouble, I followed my mother's, my late mother's footsteps, I'm proud to say,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and there were various other demonstrations we organized in Cardiff and various other activities for, so she was very much involved.
