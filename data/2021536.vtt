WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.960
I would consider you both to be, in my opinion, kind of real Newport kind

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.320
of Newport heads really. Is that fair comment do you think? Yeah. You're both very visible,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.680
both very proactive, people are very positive. I think you've done, you've both done huge amounts

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.240
for Newport, actually I really do. I'm not here to brown-nose you, but I think you both have kind of

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.040
done exactly what Newport needs, kind of, you've been a hugely positive influence. So I'm just

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.440
going to ask you first, when did we get City Stations? I can't remember. I think it was just

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.360
from doing a bit of prep for this, it was 2002 I think, I didn't make a note of it but... I was

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.960
going to say it was either 2001 or 2002 because my daughter was five because it was when the

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.240
Jubilee happened and my mum dressed her up in uni and jacks and took her to see the queen and I was

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.880
fucking fuming. What did it mean? Did it mean anything? What did Newport's kind of,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.640
well it might have been able to City Stations to have any effect on you? Funnily enough, when I was

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.880
sort of doing a bit of prep for this and reading back, because I had this horrible feeling I just

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.960
wasn't going to be able to remember anything because I spent certainly most of the noughties

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.080
in the second half of the 90s with a beer in my hand and I thought well I know that it was the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.040
most exciting time of my life and it sort of made me who I am and I made the most amazing

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.560
friends and had great experiences and I don't mean like in an alcoholic, like blackout kind of way,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.560
I just mean like it was all just such, you know, like it was like 15 years there or longer that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.440
was just kind of felt like one long night out. That's a good way of putting it. It's just sort

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.640
of very difficult to sort of put things in order. So I was having a bit of a look, you know,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.160
googling a little bit to get the chronology and remember what happened when because some things

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.800
that I thought had happened in 2005 happened in 1997 or whatever and so it was interesting.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.360
But the one thing that did come up was the City Status thing and I remember it quite well because

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.280
I remember, even though I've always felt sort of, you know, in the mixed, in the middle of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.400
the Newport experience or whatever you want to call it, I've also felt as a writer, I've also

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.280
felt very much sort of standing on the periphery of it, you know, sort of observing and almost

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.800
kind of like gathering material as my life has sort of gone on really for, you know, whenever that

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.360
might prove useful. So I don't think there's any other place in the UK really that would have been

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.280
so, you know, sort of ambivalent about it really. I mean it felt like something everybody was talking

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.160
about and it felt like there was kind of an interesting balance between, often happening

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.160
within the same sentence uttered by the same person, but this kind of like, well it's about time

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.400
and why do we care? Like why do we want this? What difference is this going to make? And there is

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.200
kind of, I know this isn't particular to Newport, but there is certainly an attitude to

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.520
of Newportonians that, you know, nobody else can criticise our place, but we're very sort of

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.080
proudly down on it ourselves. Almost like we understand it's a shithole, but we understand

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.360
the kind of the light that shines from that, you know what I mean? It's like everybody's kind of-

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.200
It's got a good image actually, the light that shines.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.640
The light, that could, that should be the city logo, get rid of the cherub,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.960
just like a turd with light shining out of it.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:02.440
You know, I do specifically remember the city status thing, really kind of encapsulating that

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.880
attitude of the Newportonian, if you like, that it was kind of like, well of course we should be a

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.360
city. How dare Cardiff, Swansea and, you know, Wrexham be cities and Newport not be, that's

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.840
ridiculous, but at the same time it's stupid that we're a city. Like how on earth do we- I mean,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.040
I suppose that this was before, you know, St Asaph and St David's, you know, and like one man and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.920
his dog in a field, and if they were waving a flag the right way they became, were given city status.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.840
So it was more sort of, there were certain people who'd been waiting a long time for Newport to

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.040
become a city, but when it became a city nobody could see exactly what the benefits were.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.200
No, were you aware of that, certainly when I was a teenager, a long time ago, were you aware of a

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.280
kind of a myth or urban myth that Newport would never get city status because of the Chardist

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.360
riots? I remember that. I was more aware of the narrative that Newport would never get city status

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.160
because that meant if you were a businessman coming from London it would be the first city you hit

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.440
when you came to Wales, and Cardiff would never allow that to happen. I mean, as you get older you

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.960
realize that almost everything you hear is a conspiracy theory. You know, as you get a bit

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.280
older you realize that most of the people in charge of things are so completely inept and out of their

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.520
depth that the very idea that a conspiracy on any level could take place is laughable. But when

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.520
you're young you kind of think, yeah, the grey suits man, you know, and especially in a place like

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.240
Newport which is very, Newport to me was always a place that was about sticking your

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.960
fingers up to authority. That's what Newport was. I mean, perhaps we'll come on to talk about it

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.120
later, but one of the things like being editor of Wales Arts Review has done for me in the last 10

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.640
years is it's kind of introduced me to Wales. I didn't grow up having any kind of anything that

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.280
would resemble a Welsh identity. I was from Newport and that was that. I think that's really an

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.320
important point and one that kind of chimes with me. Sam, being a Newport girl, were you born in

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:08.280
Newport? No, I'm from Birmingham. Look at that. I moved to Newport when I was 13, so I've been here

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:15.560
for 32 years, so I'm pretty Newport now, yeah. Honorary Newportonian? Yeah, no, Birmingham I

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.640
grew up in. My parents lived in Caleon when I was three until I was seven and then back to Birmingham

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:28.200
and then back to Newport. So I've been here like 95 percent of my life. Do you identify as Welsh or

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.200
English or both? Oh, 100 percent Welsh, 100 percent Welsh. It's interesting actually, I wasn't sure

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.920
whether I'd be Welsh or English until Wales qualified for the Euros and played England

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.640
and then I just wanted them to absolutely stuff the English and I was like oh crap I must be Welsh

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.960
because I genuinely had never really given it much thought until that match and then I was like stuff

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.520
them. So yeah. What Gary said, do you identify with any of that? The township to city, state,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.120
does that mean anything to you? The main thing I identify with what Gary said is that living in

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.920
Newport you don't have a Welsh identity. Working for Music Venue Trust for the last two years

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.640
and the way that the profile of the pub has grown over the last five years, I've been going up to

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.840
Wrexham to Focus Wales and you know over to other places to do to talk on behalf of Music Venue

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:21.160
Trust and things. I suddenly have this massive like view of how much of a Welsh identity everywhere

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:27.960
else has that Newport is really really lacking. Like I just spent six days up in Wrexham a couple

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.880
of weeks ago for Focus Wales and everything they do is about being Welsh and it's about being in

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.360
North Wales and it's about bringing you know bringing acts from Canada. They're so proud that

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.480
they're bringing these Canadians in to to North Wales and you just don't get that in Newport.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.680
There's no Welsh pride in our city and I don't know why. Well I think there's probably more

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.520
than there was than when I was younger. It's definitely on the rise, definitely.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:05.960
How old are you in 1993 Sam if you don't mind me asking? I was 17. Okay that's a good age because

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:12.200
that's when I think the Welsh Language Act was passed and I just wondered if because I was

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:20.840
knocking around then and a lot of people were nose was put out of joint by having all these

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.840
bilingual signs suddenly spreading up everywhere. It sounds ridiculous now it's quite obvious they

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:35.080
should be there but do you remember that? I got a Gary first actually. Yeah well I mean I was 14 in

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:42.440
1993 so I missed out on compulsory Welsh in school by one year and I remember not just me but all of

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.320
my friends being you know I think we might have even thrown a party specifically to celebrate the

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.160
fact we didn't have to learn compulsory Welsh and of course now I sort of not regret it because it

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.240
was beyond my control anyway but I feel a bit sad that I wasn't given the opportunity to learn

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.160
or wasn't forced to learn Welsh. There's a lot of things in school that you would have hated at the

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.320
time that when you get older I think you think oh god I wish they'd made me do that. I wish they

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.800
really forced grammar down my throat so when I hand in a manuscript for a book I'm not getting

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.360
loads of red marks back going you know I've got all these in the wrong place or that is not where

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.280
a semicolon goes. So yeah I suppose you have you know sort of different perspective when you look

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.560
back on things. I have a sort of strange relationship with the Welsh language in that like my

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.560
one half of my family comes from Welsh speaking Wales I mean my father was from Newport but my

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.240
grandfather was from Kidwelly and I remember him he'd be up when I was very young he'd be on the

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.800
phone talking to his sister in Welsh and things like that and so that was kind of my introduction

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:48.600
to Welsh was actually through this kind of like mythic like ancestral line that fed through and

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:55.720
then stopped at my dad who was you know always Newport through and through and then it kind of

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.920
came back but came back in a kind of bureaucratic way it came down from above rather than up through

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.800
the soil do you know what I mean like with my with my granddad it was an organic real thing that

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.400
attached me to a culture I knew that I had an attachment to but didn't understand and then by

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.440
the time it comes to in school and you just you know the less all I want to do is you know listen

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.560
to Bob Dylan I didn't I have no interest in Mike Stevens you know I mean that was like insane

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.120
then and it felt like it was coming down rather than it was an absolutely interesting point I

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:32.200
completely agree Welsh culture is something you have to go in search of if you come from Newport

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:38.280
it's not something that's fed you really how about you Sam you you say you identify as Welsh

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:44.680
now completely even though you were born in England yeah so that's interesting because even

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:50.040
though I am Welsh my father's Welsh my mother Scottish but was born in Wales I I've never really

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:57.240
you know cared that much to be honest about being Welsh didn't really mean it probably means more to

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:03.400
me than it ever has I remember when the Manics first came out how that kind of they were almost

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:10.120
anti-Welsh in a way and I kind of understood that you know in the late 80s because if you were from

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.480
Wales especially if you're in like because my being in bands my background you know there were no

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:21.480
there was no bands from who were cool from Wales in the in the 80s really or very few and you know

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.120
it was almost a cross you had to bear to be Welsh you know people would just assume that you were

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:34.440
shit if you were in a group you know anyway but enough of me so so again so what's your relationship

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.000
like with the Welsh language or just with your Welsh identity this would be interesting be in

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.240
English I actually took up Welsh on Duolingo during lockdown not getting that far not doing

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.920
that well but I'm determined to keep it going but yeah Dwynduski Cymraeg so yeah I am learning

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:57.240
very very slowly it's it's a very difficult language but it's so beautiful and I gave

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:03.400
evidence to a select committee in the senate back about three years ago about grassroots music in

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.600
Wales and I was the only person there who needed the translation headphones and that really bothered

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.800
me because this is my country and it is the music scene that I've spent 30 years working in and I

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.680
want to be able to talk about it in the language of the country you know I don't want to have to

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.240
be the only person there with the translation headphones on it was it was a real eye-opener

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.960
to how much I'd missed by not as Gary said by not being forced to do Welsh in school because I was

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:33.240
in school in Wales at the same time but obviously I was three years away from compulsory Welsh

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.320
and I do feel like I'm which school were you in I went to quite a few schools because my parents

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.920
moved a lot so I went to Westmarn in Pontypool and I went to Fairwater in Cwmbran and I went to

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.960
Closaciliog in Cwmbran. Wow that's good okay well you're talking about my manner there yeah.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.200
Yeah so yeah and I think in terms of Welsh identity one of the things that's driven it

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.600
at the moment is the difference between Welsh identity and British identity because there's

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.680
an artist I'm a little bit obsessed with at the moment a black punk artist called Bob Villain

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.360
and one of the things he does is Bob Villain did you say? Bob Villain.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:12.520
One of the things he does is he pisses on a Union Jack because he absolutely despises you know the

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.400
English government and the English system and when he played in Wrexham a few weeks ago I had

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.520
to say to him do not do that to the Welsh flag I said if you've got a Union Jack with you do it

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.480
but you cannot get away with that in Wales the people in Wales will not appreciate you pissing

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.200
on their dragon you know and I had to and I think that's a big indicator of how different the culture

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.680
of England and Wales is is that in Wales if you piss on our flag someone's going to beat the shit

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.000
out of you. I say interesting actually it's not the English flag it's the English flag is the St.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.280
George's Cross you know it's the Unionist flag Union flag yeah but you have I don't even know

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:55.640
how long but for years 20 years at least probably more you've been a real kind of face and a real

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:02.280
positive role model and driver of live music in Newport you know and South Wales really do you

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.840
ever put Welsh bands on? All the time yeah we're doing I'm not going to try and say it in Welsh but

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.800
it's Welsh Music Day in January and we're organising an entire week of Welsh language bands

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.840
in the pub because that's really important there's a Welsh language band from Cardiff called Chroma

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.280
and they are phenomenal and you know it's just there's so much amazing Welsh language music out

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.520
there at the moment it's really really coming through like back in the 90s when you know when

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.680
Gorkies came through and there was this oh god is Welsh language actually going to break through

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:37.800
into the mainstream thing I think that might finally happen now. Well okay maybe I'm not the

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.840
opinion actually that the language of rock and roll is not English it's actually American you know

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:50.280
if you listen to it's kind of it's kind of the American we're dealing with really rather than

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:55.320
English. Yeah you've got bands like you've got bands like Adwaith coming out of West Wales who

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.960
are phenomenal and just things like that and there are some really incredible like Welsh language

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:07.560
artists out there at the moment. I want to talk a bit more about Newport though I'm going to

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:14.200
nap you guys on music as well but I wanted to just try to talk about a few things anything you

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.400
can think of I put the Newport for some reason we got the Newport ship discovery here is anybody

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:25.640
interested in that or is that Gary I've got a feeling you might be interested in the Newport ship.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:31.240
Well maybe not quite as interested as you might think but I think the Newport ship debacle is

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.840
that what it is going to be called is it still in a shed somewhere like in a tank of water.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.800
Yeah isn't the basement of the riverfront the shape that it is because the ship was supposed

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.600
to go there something and then somebody realized that actually no it will just rot if we can't keep

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:52.360
it wet yeah it was it was something like that the entire of the riverfront theater has a ridiculous

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.880
basement it's huge have you been there yeah it's massive yeah we did we did a crazy golf project

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.960
for them where we built crazy golf out of trash and they let us build down there because no one

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.800
uses it for anything else and it's huge the word Gary used is perfect it's a debacle to pull a

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.240
perfect specimen of a medieval ship out of the river while you're building a theater and then

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:20.840
custom build a completely inappropriate space for that ship it's just so Newport it's so Newport

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:27.240
it seems to me that the whole thing around the ship at the time and consequently is something

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:33.400
that again you know is speaks almost like microcosmically of what where Newport stands

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:38.280
and what it is because I think I should have looked this up I can't remember the precise

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:46.600
details but there are worse examples of this type of medieval ship medieval boat you know

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:53.560
merchant vessel in other areas of the UK and they they are like prized possessions in that

00:16:53.560 --> 00:17:00.360
area there's one in Bristol I believe or at least along that coast I did a thing for radio three

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:06.040
and one of the other people who are on this like arts round table discussion was a professor from

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.720
Bristol who was there to talk about the medieval ship that he'd been sort of working on looking

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.200
after and curating and and he was like well it's really interesting because obviously you know you're

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.360
from Newport this is off air you're from Newport that's really interesting because you've actually

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:25.080
got much better medieval ship than we've gotten it's isn't it just sat in a in a shed somewhere

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:31.400
in a tub of water and and you you just you know you just wonder maybe it's a bit of a

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:38.840
Welsh thing I don't know that I have you know a lot of opinions about how the Welsh establishment

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:44.760
for want of a better term regards its own art and culture I don't think there's enough people who

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.160
feel free to talk about that I mean this is your chance to

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.920
feel like you've got your own show well oh I've got plenty of chances to talk about this

00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:03.720
um I just think there's um they they they are too many people in decision-making offices um who you

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:10.360
know aren't interested in reading books or listening to music or going to the theatre I mean ironically

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.600
I mean I you know I probably should say from the off I don't live in Newport anymore I haven't

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:21.800
been for four years but um uh I would say that Jane Bryant who's the assembly member for Newport

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:29.080
Westroyd lived for you know nearly 35 years 40 years um is one of the most like interesting

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:34.840
cultured people I knew Jane before she became an am and she's a massive reader she's a massive

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.600
music fan and and hopefully she will work her way through the ranks and become you know more

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.200
influential as the years go by she's only been an am for you know the last the election but last

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:52.280
the one before um I think she already is she's put a stamp all over the Lady Ronda campaign and

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.320
that is now gathering some serious momentum you know things like so it's yeah yeah sorry it's

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.120
getting better yeah I didn't even suggest she didn't uh didn't have any you know sway but like

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.680
as it goes on I'd expect her to become a cabinet member and then who knows what you know in the

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:14.280
next decade or whatever um and and I think she'd bring that cultured uh idea of what being in an

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:20.920
office like hers um should be and you know um politics could do with more cultured people you

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:26.280
know absolutely if if the if the people you want to the people you want to see in politics are not

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.600
just like people who are passionate about all those things that are important social change and

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.040
you want people who you know read books for fun yeah you know people who people who have a record

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:41.560
collection you know people who go to gigs people who you know who are interested in the theater

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.840
people who you know you can sit in a pub and talk about whatever with you know not just somebody who

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.640
has a load of bullet points and they they they know how to operate in the political sphere which

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:59.800
is how you become successful in politics mostly nowadays tell us just about your first gigs you

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:06.280
went to you know things you the gigs you remember in newport first gig i went to was neds atomic

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:13.320
dustbin in newport center and i absolutely loved it i thought it was the greatest thing that i'd

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:19.560
ever been to in my life and then i tried to go to a gig in lapub but i was 16 so i got thrown out

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.080
and then i had to wait until i was 18 to go back because kieran had clocked me and knew exactly who

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.560
i was and what i looked like so i spent all my time in tj's at gigs instead because

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.240
funny story john siccolo knew my family when we were living in chilean when i was three

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:42.840
and the first time i went into tj's at 13 maybe my 14th birthday i think he clocked me

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:49.400
clocked who my parents were but also thought i was my sister who was 10 years older than me so for

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:54.280
the first five years i was at gigs and tj's john would call me manda and he'd always say how's the

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.680
baby meaning me and i'd say things like yeah she's great she's doing the gcse's this year

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.160
and he'd be like oh send her my love and then i turned up on my 18th and he just whacked me

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:08.520
around the head in typical john fashion you are the fucking baby you bastard and i was like yeah

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:14.440
sorry john so yeah that was just a lot of time in tj's really how do you remember that place though

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.760
because it's such it's such a lot of people you know so many everyone's got their own story and

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:26.440
memories tj's it kind of looms large in the new book legend but each story is kind of personal

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:34.520
and you were a regular right yeah i was four or five nights a week for about 10 years i think

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:40.200
because i once i got a job in lapar that was when simon was putting on gigs and the headline band

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:45.480
wouldn't go on till half 11 so i would close the bar at 10 to 11 fly through clean down and be in

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:51.880
tj's by 25 past 11 to watch the most incredible bands after my shift you know and then on the

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:57.960
weekends i'd go over drinking so you you but you kind of went from being a just a music fan

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:05.400
and a barmaid right i guess to running the shit you know running the show and booking the band

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:12.040
and so tell us a bit about that if i remember if i remember you did you put on british c-pads

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.880
yeah i did yeah they became such an important band and they've still gone actually they've

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.920
changed their name they dropped british haven't they yeah they're now called c-power because

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:28.760
they don't want to be associated with you know any kind of uh toxicity around them

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.400
they didn't want bob villan pissing on any of their album covers

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:41.880
for me the main thing was when i took over the pub as manager it blew my mind that the venue was

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:48.520
sat there empty and we only did local bands on a thursday and yet we had this incredible 100

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:55.960
capacity venue because while tj's is was amazing it was also too big for local bands and smaller

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.720
touring bands to feel like they'd make you know they could ever fill it so a lot of them would

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:05.320
just skip newport by and go somewhere else that had a smaller venue so like the first thing i did

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:11.160
was why are we doing gigs seven days a week you know we've got a pa we've got a stage why why are

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:16.360
we only opening this room on thursdays for one local band and then fridays and saturdays for

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.480
discos why are we doing gigs seven nights a week so i reached out to some mates who were putting on

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.520
gigs in cardiff and offered a free venue hire and then that was it then the pub's been a staple of

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:32.200
the touring circuit actually you know i used to go there i actually think it's a much better venue

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:38.520
now the shape of it you know but you agree i love it yeah i love the new venue absolutely love it

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.920
somebody came in a few weeks ago and said it was the old one was better and i was like well

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:47.560
no it wasn't you're wrong like i'm sure nostalgically yeah because you were younger

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:54.120
and you had some of your best times there but in terms of accessibility and everything else the

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.760
new one is so much better and the people that are having the time of their life there now are having

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.360
it in much better venue yeah no one's going to fall down the stairs and break their necks

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.680
no one's going to have to tell their disabled friend they can't come in right because of the

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:11.960
stairs you know it's it's just a much better venue for loads of reasons mainly the lack of the bloody

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:17.720
stairs gary similar sort of question really i mean yeah you're not smith's gig by any chance were

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.520
you i don't know if you were no no the smith's gig would have been uh before my time i mean the

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:30.040
two gigs um when was the smith's gig 86 yeah yeah something like that it's when he got pulled off

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:35.400
the stage you know he got pulled off the i mean we all knew the story and and i don't know if you

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.880
remember that he came back to newport i was reading the as doing prep for this but morris

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:45.560
he came back he played newport when he was supporting bowie in 95 they played newport center

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.120
that was the the famous tour that morris he quit the tour halfway through and the quote was

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:55.080
the quote was that i'll never forget for morris he was um which is just such a brilliant hilarious

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:59.960
quote coming for out of morris's mouth was that when i signed up to do the tour i didn't realize

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.840
that we would have to spend the entire time worshiping at the temple of david okay so what

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.640
newport music experiences do you remember so going back before the decade that we

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.000
sort of talking about i mean the interesting thing for me is how clearly i remember my first gig in

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.840
newport and the reason was was because i was about 13 and i went with my dad my dad got me tickets to

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:26.360
see huey louis and the news in newport center and it was the second gig i'd ever been to because the

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.200
first gig he ever took them to was not long before that we went to see paul mccartney and

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:36.600
ills court and that was my first ever live musical experience but um but huey louis and the news it

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:41.400
was you know i think i went through a period probably for a while of like being slightly

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.600
well i'm not going to tell my mates about that you know probably through the 90s i never mentioned

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.240
that was my one of my early early musical experience but like looking back at it i

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.280
remember it really well because i was young so obviously i hadn't been drinking because i was

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:59.720
a my old man and stuff but um uh and i was like 13 so i probably wasn't drinking by that point

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:06.280
anyway but um uh just that it was an absolutely fantastic gig i mean for a start i was 13 and i

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:12.040
was watching essentially what was to me the you know a live version of the back to the future

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:17.160
soundtrack now what like 13 year old boy wouldn't think that was the greatest night night of their

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:23.880
life but also i remember really clearly that they did um a like 50s acapella set in the middle

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.320
where the band put all their instruments down and walked to the front of the stage and did like four

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:34.520
or five songs as an acapella set and it was and it was even at sort of my young uh fresh age at

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:41.160
that point i remember thinking just what an amazing thing that was but then you know going on from

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:48.520
there i mean i've been going through the gigs that i missed more than anything the gigs that i that

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.920
i've got a bit of a history of missing great gigs missing faithless at v3 which i think was the

00:26:54.920 --> 00:27:03.320
i was i was i was abroad at the time i was there was a hilarious story about that gig so faithless

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:12.600
played v3 and max jazz left a huge bag of weed and a bible in the dressing room and laurence who owned

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:18.280
v3 mailed the book back with a message that said enjoy your weed not so much your book and that

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:24.200
was that was that was his message that he sent back that was a great gig that was that was a

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:29.560
really great gig yeah that was a famously great gig in the in the world's probably the world's

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:35.480
weirdest short-lived club of v3 which i yeah i i almost completely forgotten about my experiences

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:40.840
of v3 and the 65 foot dragon that made its staircase um that's about that that sounds

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:47.080
interesting i don't even know about it well it was it was a club that the the guy um laurence howells

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:53.080
who owned the cotton club in the 90s he owned the cotton club and um part of rumors which was um

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:59.800
which is now the pub which is now the pub it is indeed um i worked in v3 for a long time yeah you

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.600
did not you got it was out was yeah it was only open for 15 months and i think i worked in it for

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:11.560
all of them it was a very very strange place really strange you could fill an hour with stories of v3

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:19.080
quite yeah you really i painted v3 before it opened i was like god what was i doing i was i was

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:26.440
i spent my teens and 20s like doing temp jobs and just earning beer tokens really to hang it in new

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.240
port that was my life i mean there's just there's no slander here because laurence ended up in

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.600
prison for drug offenses oh yeah he was insane but i was trying to run the bar the one saturday and

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:43.160
we had no alcohol nothing and i said we can't open he said we can we charge him a tenner to get in

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.000
then we sell him the drugs in the cloakroom and i was like i don't want to know about that i need

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.880
to run the bar so he borrowed like a thousand pound off some mates and went off to the cash

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:57.160
and carry and he came back with a 12 foot lava lamp for the vip area and i was like where's the

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:03.320
booze and he was like oh how cool is this and i was like literally i have nothing on the bar

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:08.840
like this the man was completely insane yeah absolutely insane yeah he was he was i don't

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.760
think i know him wait what's v3 remind me where it is it was argos on stow hill for a while

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:21.160
okay um offices now i mean newport has always been to my mind anyway quite druggy you know

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.560
a lot of drugs in newport well i always used to blow my mind that everybody knew you could buy

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.920
drugs in the cloakroom in v3 and the guy that was in the cloakroom was always off his tits but you

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.000
always got your coat back as well it's amazing he did actually look after your coat as well

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:43.160
yeah you could get your coat as well as your drugs conscientious yeah saturday nights were called

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:48.520
enigma weren't they the dj nights were called oh yeah that was well yeah and he used to make us

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:54.200
turn up for work 15 minutes early take our shoes off and stand on the dance floor while he played

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.520
enigma the wailing monk song and we'd all just been looking at each other like what the

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:05.160
fuck is this guy doing i just want to earn my money and go home it was absolutely bonkers

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:11.240
absolutely insane it was a really strange place it was very very new book because he also booked

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:17.560
terror vision when they were at the absolute pits of their career yeah and we'd sold about 15 tickets

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:22.840
and then they released tequila yeah that's right and overnight i think we went from 15 tickets to

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.880
800 tickets the gig was like a week later and we had no bar staff no door staff because we'd sold

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:33.560
no tickets so we were scrabbling like nutters yeah i do remember that pretty sure he paid them

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.600
100 pounds and then they got to number one the week of the gig and then they released tequila

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.120
three weeks over one then they played b3 and he made an absolute killing it is a place that's

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:49.160
kind of been forgotten in the the history of newport nightlife and yeah it was the place that had

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:54.920
that 65 foot dragon yep that but breathe smoke it was the smoke machine but actually yeah it was a

00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:01.160
i think it was bigger than 65 foot gap was it it was it was essentially the on the staircase

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:07.400
well it went from so the tail was in the foyer yeah and then there was a foot at the back of the

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:14.200
room on the left hand side and then the whole thing curved around and then the head came over

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:20.360
the dance floor and then the other foot was at the other side of the room so the entire of the room

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:25.320
was just dragon when you press the smoke remote behind the dj the smoke would come out with the

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.680
dragon's mouth and his eyes would light up and it was incredible it must have cost so much money

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:38.440
met the artist because he came down and john the quiff was um obviously was doing nights at v3

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.480
and when the artist came down i met he was from west wales or something wasn't it from

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:48.520
yeah it was a phenomenal piece of artwork that was there's a wales online article not long

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.320
ago that josh natman wrote because i was chatting to josh in a pub and v3 came up and he went i need

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:59.400
to research this place and the dragon is now in somebody's garden in cardiff just in the garden

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.120
just chilling in the garden god they must have a big garden

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.920
i want to try and get some geography like where some place i start with gary actually because

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:16.120
you are you born and you bought gary yeah yeah yeah where are you from which part i was from

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:22.360
malpus originally but then um uh when i was about six or seven my parents moved up to

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:30.920
sort of the the the very edge of the ham post stroke gear and i went to um and then uh where

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:37.080
they still live actually yeah so i kind of went my dad my dad was a builder and he'd um uh yeah it

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.480
was kind of a big move my family had always my mother's from liverpool but my family had kind

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.120
of always lived in bettus malpus so where were your boyhood haunts where were your kind of uh

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:53.400
where did you like my boyhood haunts well um i mean boy my my parents house was is right by

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.120
saint willa cemetery which is i think it's like i think is my father was talking about this

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:02.760
recently i think is like the largest municipal cemetery in the uk or something i gotta think

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.960
for i love cemeteries actually oh well i mean it's still i mean my dad walks walks the dog

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:13.000
around there so i still go around there every now and again it is absolutely huge it takes two

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
hours to take the dog around the whole thing because i do it with mine it's a really good walk

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.360
that was my main horn that's playing in there i mean like that is weird yeah i mean it sounds

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:26.680
weirder than it was i think but my one of my best friends in school um in primary school and then

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:31.560
we went to the secondary school together um his father was the foreman so we could get away with

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.960
doing lots of things that you you know kids who just jumped over the fence couldn't do like we

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.560
could play football there for instance because because he'd go well play football down by here

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.200
because you're not going to be hitting any grave stones or you know they won't be able to see you

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.320
from the office and that kind of thing do you know what i mean but but we used to you know we

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:52.600
used to play football in the summer we used to play a bunch of us um school kids would play against

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:58.360
all the gravediggers down by the down by the um down with the mess room and uh you know these

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:03.720
were all like raggedy ass middle-aged men and they kicked lumps out of us and we had a whale of a time

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.400
but yeah so that was like when i was a kid when we started going out which was probably we were

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:14.760
probably like probably like 15 but really 16 i probably went to tj's like a mate it was a

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:21.240
right to passage really wasn't it yeah yeah t the things i remember earliest of tj's in the like

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:28.360
94 95 96 yes she is my best years i reckon the best year yeah probably yeah but i remember i

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:33.160
remember my best mate he really didn't like beer he hated lager something you know he sort of grew

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:38.760
out of but um so we used to go to go to tj's and he yeah i remember he went up to the bar and say

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:44.920
and asked for a vodka orange and they gave him vodka with like half a pint of orange cordial

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.600
and he just kind of drank it and was like this what a vodka and orange must be i suppose

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.400
just like half a pint of cordial with a shot of vodka in it but um and i think he drank that for

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.400
a few years before he realized that that's not what a vodka orange was you know one of the things

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:06.280
people i mean because i'm older than you guys generation or so i am i've said this to glenn's

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:13.640
that people people do tend to romanticize tj's actually um and that's fair enough because it

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:20.440
was a brilliant place and a certain time it really took off but actually in the late 80s and early

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:26.600
90s it could be very scary it could be a violent place you know i saw some i've seen some pretty

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:34.200
uh pretty small i saw a really horrific fight in there once at one point somebody got punched to

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:39.960
death in there that story has got an infamous tj story carried out and left to die on the street

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:47.560
you know um and the other thing that people kind of because it became a great rock and roll venue

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:53.160
but actually one of the reasons it became a venue was quite simply the fact that it was doing so

00:35:53.160 --> 00:36:03.240
badly as a as a pub or a bar that that in the end john was almost forced to take in um you know

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.120
bands who couldn't get gigs anywhere else you know she was like we couldn't get a gig anyway

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:14.120
oh john can we play here you know uh matriarchal and at least he'll buy beer and that would and

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:19.880
it was kind of almost like a meeting of two desperate situations you know and then it kind

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:26.840
of evolved into this great great venue when when really Simon definitely and also connell duds

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:32.600
connell dubs didn't really the fair share connell duds really um because Simon would only put

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:38.600
american bands on you know then further once connell was kind of moved on to bigger things

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:44.440
you had johnny phillips and the sick future crew i think there's this massive tendency to romanticize

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.320
john and john was an amazing guy but he was not the person that bought the bands to newport

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.880
there was there was simon there was connell there was johnny phillips you know there was a lot of

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.680
people bringing bands to newport it was amazing that john gave them a space to do that that was

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:03.640
affordable and gave them a space where you could actually like put punk bands on without getting

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:10.760
thrown out he was a great character john though he gave the place a certain uh you know i i i do

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.080
think more credit needs to go out to the people that were bringing the bands to the the weird

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:19.720
little border town that wasn't cardiff or bristol i will mention them you know i mean connell duds

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:28.360
obviously he was famously was always his agent you know he brought them there and now he runs

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:32.520
i was at that gig i stood on a table and showed we'd bring back the 64 dolls because i thought

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.960
shit

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.760
i'm cut we're done that gig though sam i'll cut this bit out is i do simply remember it different

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:51.000
with me because i was at that show obviously because we played them yeah when i was hanging

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.440
out with oasis before yeah no no and because i didn't know they were i never you know i didn't

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.160
know them they weren't famous basically for two weeks later they were really famous but

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:07.000
that period they were i don't remember it being packed do you was it it was not packed there was

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:14.360
about 65 of us i would say and that is a generous estimate because i get so sick of everybody saying

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:19.320
they were there because you weren't i'm sorry i'm not i'm not like grabbing my own fucking call

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.840
points here you weren't there the other thing was a coach i remember two at least one coach if not

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:30.120
two but at least one coach from manchester show that with all their mates on it no i used to do

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.960
we used to do stuff like that is that if you play a gig at the town no one's going to come and see

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.960
you so you you take all your mates you know it's the only way you have an audience you probably do

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.280
it with the pub yeah i remember a coach coming down from manchester and i remember doing the gig

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.720
and i remember oasis going on but i just don't remember it being packed so it was not packed i

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:54.840
because i remember being you played and then me and remember my friend angie it was so quiet

00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:00.440
and i remember being sat on the floor just in front of the stage smoking fags waiting for them

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.040
to come on there wasn't even a queue of people waiting for them to come on everyone else was at

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:10.040
the bar it was it was it was a really quiet gig i remember being sat on the floor on the floor

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.680
smoking a fag and thinking i wonder if these guys will be any good and then they came on and they

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.400
opened with cigarettes and alcohol which was the only single they've released so therefore they

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.440
played the only song i knew so they brought the shit out of me so i just left and decided to

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:32.920
harass them yeah so i thought i was misremembering step because everyone was telling me how packed it

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:42.600
was i was like no it was not i was um i was gonna say that um you know like the like like you said

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:47.320
earlier rich like the the peak years of tj's i think was sort of the mid 90s that was when everything

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.680
was coming together you had all those bands that went on to do great things playing there

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:57.240
and i think if you go into the you know a little bit later than that maybe but but the 90s i think

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:03.640
had that real kind of nightlife music ecosystem that was going on that fed into the noughties a

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:09.960
little bit but i think you know um i think you know the decade we were going to talk about the

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:13.640
noughties one of the things that when i was thinking about it earlier was the the noughties

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:18.120
even though a lot there was a lot of great stuff going on and there was you know good clubs and

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.560
it was you know le pub was was absolutely banging it was definitely um one of the best places to be

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:29.400
um uh in the you know in still is now but in the noughties you know it's just like there was so

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:35.800
much going on but i think also it was a time when that kind of newport nostalgia thing began and

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.920
look looking back on you know there was a lot going on about looking back on the 90s and i think

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:46.600
like i spent like 25 years sat at the bar in the merringer and you know that was you know that was

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:52.440
where where i was and the merringer shut at 11 obviously every night and that's when you'd go

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.560
to all the other places like le perbe or anywhere else that was that was my that was always my

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.360
journey and and the the thing rob jones who's still a landlady there who's like a bit of a

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:08.600
newport legend obviously um uh the thing about um that used to do rob's head in in the in the

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.280
noughties regularly was people coming in and saying where's your jukebox because they got rid

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.920
of the jukebox it was part of you know the brewery thing uh the sam smith brewery got rid of all

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.680
entertainment tvs and jukeboxes in the early noughties i think it was when they refurbed the

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:27.880
pub but the 90s you know the merringer jukebox was a was was like an iconic an iconic thing

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:33.240
but rob is a huge music head isn't he basically yeah yeah exactly you know he's a bit of an old

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:39.400
mardin you know he's um yeah massive massive music fan but but it was that jukebox in the merringer

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.880
that introduced me to loads of bands that i still hold really dearly today you know the idea of a

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:49.240
jukebox just being a place in the corner where you can put some music on to give some ambience to a

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:55.560
to a to a to a space to a pub is you know is one thing but what the the merringer jukebox was and

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:59.480
you know i'm not saying this was the only thing but it became kind of iconic particularly when

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.800
it was gone people would always be asking about what happened to the jukebox and uh when's the

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:09.160
jukebox coming back rob was the easiest way to wind robert behind the grab to get like you know

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:13.000
something thrown at a lemon thrown at your head or something that was definitely the easiest way

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.480
to get that done but it wasn't just about um it wasn't just they were great tunes on it it was

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:24.040
it was about the attitude of the pub but also it introduced me to loads of things like it introduced

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:30.040
me to political areas i i don't know at what point i would have got around to listening to the redskins

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:35.320
if it wasn't for hearing the redskins on the merringer jukebox when i was like 18 19 or whatever

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.360
i think it says a lot for newport as a town that had a rich musical history was that me and rob

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.000
from the merringer had a conversation about how terry calia was probably only on two jukeboxes

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.800
in the uk and they were both in newport because he was in the pub and the merringer and we were

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:53.720
like we were like we should we should research this because we can't imagine walking into a

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:59.000
pub anywhere else in britain finding terry calia on the jukebox and we don't i think that shows like

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.840
at that point newport had such a rich rich musical history that it was just represented

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:10.040
everywhere you went every pub you went in you know that something would be going on somewhere

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.920
i mean look at the riverfront even the riverfront was doing gigs back then which seems mental to me

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:20.120
now that they were actually doing original bands the buzzcocks played in the riverfront what the

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:26.760
hell is that about you know really really strange i i just think like if you wanted to encapsulate

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:34.200
like what you know my experience of growing up and growing on in newport from like mid-90s to

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:40.520
you know 20 years later was that everything everything went through the prism of music like

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:46.520
everything you talked about all your nights out um even for you know the couple of decades since

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:51.960
when the merringer is at no jukebox and had no music it's still the like number one topic of

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:57.000
conversation in any nook or cranny or at the bar it's still the pub that everybody goes to before the pub

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:02.520
but there's a gig at the pub everyone will go to the merringer for a beer before it's still that

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:08.120
place that music people just just gravitate to the thing about the noughties was that the jukebox

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:14.680
was gone and i think it kind of stands for something along the track of we were everybody

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:20.120
was kind of looking back on things even by then you know sort of 2004 2005 people were looking

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:25.960
back and thinking about you know how how great newport was in the 90s just like how everywhere

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.520
was busy there were loads of great bands coming through and i think also talking about that musical

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:36.920
element and the nightlife sorry the the musical nightlife was it was the noughties when bands

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:42.600
you know sort of mid-range bands and big bands not the sort of bands that would play

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:50.920
the pub but the the medium range and the big audience bands um stopped coming to newport like

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:55.800
newport center stopped you know as far as like you remember newport center was just to have

00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:02.280
motorhead there every year and um maybe delimitri that would that's what newport center was there

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:08.200
for um whereas you know as we've talked about boi played there and you know uh the smiths and

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:14.200
the cure and um people just stopped booking those level those mid-range bands in newport they just

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:18.840
stopped booking them and neds atomic dustbin the cure the wonder stuff all played newport center

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:24.440
at some point exactly exactly and i and i think you know that was the noughties was the time when

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:29.640
people started looking back and maybe beginning to realize that those bands weren't coming to

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.480
newport anymore and i think there's a lot of reasons for those bands not coming to newport but

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:37.640
you know what one of them apparently i think one of the goldie looking chain told me this years ago

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:42.920
was that um uh promoters of those mid-range bands just didn't really want to come to wales anymore

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:49.240
because for some reason um in wales people buy the majority of people buy their tickets the night

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:55.400
before the gig and just no promoters wanted that kind of stress of like putting a band on and then

00:45:55.400 --> 00:46:01.000
24 hours before the gig going we sold 50 tickets for like a 2000 seat with except the cure when

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000
everyone from my college camped for three days for tickets three days in tents for tickets for the

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.560
cure i think when i think when those bands were playing you know when the cure were there in the

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.120
i think they were there in the late 90s they played a few times and they played the late 90s as well

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:20.760
when those bands were there you know they were still packing out you know but but i just think

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.080
bands started going straight to carliff which was a shame because all carliff venues are terrible

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.080
you know like newport center was was a leisure center but it was a really good venue you know

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:34.360
had good acoustics it had a kind of a good vibe um even though it was you know um uh so you know

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:38.440
black great down there and things like that if you turned up early enough you could get chips after

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:43.960
you swim and then go watch a band exactly the famous chips before the band i took my knees

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:49.320
to see robbie williams and they were i think they were eight and nine so i just left them

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.000
went and sat in the caff and ate chips i didn't want to see robbie williams i'm going to sit in

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.080
the cafe and eat chips that's exactly what the leisure center experience should be like really

00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:01.880
isn't it you just like leave leave the kids to go and do whatever they're going to do see robbie

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:06.680
williams or take karate lessons or whatever it is it's all much of a muchness really and you just

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:10.760
sit there and eat chips and read the paper i don't know what was in there cheap ketchup because i hate

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:14.600
cheap ketchup except the cheap ketchup they had in newport center which was delicious

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:20.280
another another iconic element of newport in those days with ketchup in the leisure center

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.560
the ketchup in the leisure center

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.120
i can ask you i'm gonna ask you some questions and just kind of like respond

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:34.600
quick fire if you can what is it you like or love about newport sam i've got you first well why do

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:39.960
you stay here so long you came here you can you know honestly i love that it's not cardiff or

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:45.640
bristol and i love that it's i have no disrespect to cardiff and bristol no no they're great cities

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:51.320
they've got a lot more going for them than we have but they also have people that are so full of

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:56.120
themselves because they're from cardiff or bristol and they look down on everybody that isn't from a

00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:00.520
major city and you don't get that in newport you know people from newport they know they know their

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.440
town's a shithole but it's their shithole and they're not going to look down on anybody else

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.560
they're going to welcome you into their shithole because they could do with some more people in

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:12.200
it to improve it a little bit you know it's a it's a really welcoming place where people just don't

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:16.920
they don't seem to there's pride in where you come from but it doesn't translate into

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:22.120
belittling people that aren't from there i think it's small enough newport and newport is a city i

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:26.760
suppose but it's so so small it's more of a big town really it's kind of small and i can't get

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:33.160
lost in cardiff cardiff sprawls you know like like gary i left a long time ago but i still

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:38.600
i do feel my heart belongs to newport i definitely think newport has always been much cooler than

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.800
cardiff in every kind of cultural cutting edge way it has you know richard king said that to me

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:51.160
actually cardiff is is just uncool man newport is always to me it's always been the people you know

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.720
the people like i don't that's not like a big sort of nebulous oh the people the people are so

00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:00.920
wonderful it's just a great sort of you know it's just a great social movement and that's that's

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:05.800
not what i mean i mean like the individual people that all of the friends i've made over the years

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.880
the conversations i've had like sam that you know the nights i've had in your gaffes and the

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.880
the piss ups we've had and the conversations we've had you know are really dear to me in it

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:19.240
and so are all the conversations i've had with complete strangers at bars there are people who i

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:24.360
i hold really dear to my heart that i have never ever seen in my life without a drink in their hand

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:31.160
and and you know these all these people are really important to me and and i'm my my next book my

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:36.200
next novel i'm working on is is most likely going to be about newport in the mid-north east funnily

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:41.480
enough since you asked me to talk about this decade specifically and it's been really interesting

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:47.560
going back and visiting those you know mainly a lot of the loudest characters rather than you know

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:54.840
the quiet sensible people but going back and visiting those characters and sort of

00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:00.440
i mean the book is years away from from being anything but but you know finally just going

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:06.200
back and thinking about the people that i spent time with and i think i think i think also being

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.520
away from newport as i have them for four years now i mean i come my family's still there so i

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:16.120
you know come back every week but having the distance from it now is something that's given

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:22.440
me the opportunity to think about writing about it properly you know not be not being out in the

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:27.320
pubs or in the nightlife or i'm also you know in my 40s now and one of the reasons i moved i mean

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:31.480
there were many reasons i moved to korea but one of them was that i thought getting away from newport

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:39.400
would sort of help me figure out what i thought about the place figure out my relationship and

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:48.120
sort of help me process you know the sort of 25 years i spent um out you know sat at the bar

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:53.160
and when i sort of decided that i wasn't going to be doing that quite so much i mean i got a family

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:59.080
now and stuff and um when i realized i wasn't going to be really living that life anymore i

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:03.480
i wanted to write about it and that's kind of where i'm headed at the moment but thinking about

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:09.080
those characters and the people that i've that are my friends the people that i've even people

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:13.640
that aren't my friends who are just people that were always people i saw um going back and sort

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.920
of thinking about it and writing notes and sketches and characters and things like that

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:24.680
it's it was just a just is and was a phenomenal place full of i know it can be a cliche you know

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:28.840
characters you know the characters that you meet in the merger for instance and we can all

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.480
name probably 20 different ones although there'd be a venn diagram there where blakey would exist

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:39.480
in almost all of those venn diagrams no doubt but um for many different reasons but um but just all

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:44.360
those people and all the things those people brought to the table the different cultural

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:50.600
musical influences you know you you go to the pub on a on a wednesday thursday friday and you'd

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:56.040
come away with a new playlist and that's you know 25 years of drinking in there drinking in

00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:02.360
drinking in newport and drinking in the merengier and never once did i not feel like i was learning

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:07.480
something or encountering something even though i was just for the most part sat in the same on

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:13.400
the same store it really does in a new port i think really has uh great characters it's always

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:22.440
had great characters you know freak show yeah exactly some kind of strange carnival um but

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:27.640
also you know the point of writing a book like that is that you want to sort of capture some

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:32.120
kind of essence which is what i suppose we an element of what we've been talking about tonight

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:38.280
but capture some kind of essence of what a place feels like and what the people they sort of create

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:46.600
how about you san how do you think newport has changed since you've been here how do you hope it

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.680
has changed since you've been here how do you hope it has changed since you've been here how do you

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:59.240
i don't know i i think there's there's been a lot of it's really difficult to try and articulate but

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:06.600
i think newport is severely lacking in support from arts council wales and other organizations

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:12.840
of that ilk in that we have the riverfront but it's not used and it's just staffed by people who

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:17.640
understand the arts and yet are somehow running an arts center and that is one of my biggest

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:23.320
bug bears and i think when that theater was built there was this great like there was this great

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:27.400
feeling of okay they're they're going to build us a theater and we're going to be able to do the

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:32.920
most incredible things and have you know the most incredible acts coming to our theater and you end

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:40.040
up with a panto and a couple of comedians every year because and i mean speaking personally i

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:46.280
struggled for four years to get any form of support from arts council wales because i mean

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:52.520
they want to romanticize the past of me but when it comes to future funding you have to fight tooth

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:57.720
and nail whereas it seems if you're in cardiff or rexham or swansea and those are the only three

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:02.840
cities in wales i really have any experience of working in it seems if you're in one of those

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:07.640
three cities then they want to do things with you they want to work with you they want to you know

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:14.280
they want to help bring in the future whereas in newport i don't know what the issue is but it

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:18.920
needs looking into because we have the infrastructure we have you know the pubs a great venue the

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:23.320
morrange is still there the riverfront's a great venue we're getting a new leisure center

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:29.960
but without the support of arts council wales and the offices involved and other funders other arts

00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:35.240
funders they're just going to sit empty for another 20 years and i think the big difference to me is

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:40.120
that the buildings are there now but there's still not the support that needed to be put in place

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:45.480
what breaks my heart is when i go to newport these days is seeing the death of the high street you

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:50.840
know i think that's probably a national problem but yeah but it seems to it's not really we're

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:55.160
not in cardiff yet and but i mean it is a national problem but the newport seems to have been hit

00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:01.080
hardest i think i think it's it's a national problem but it's it's not hitting the massive cities

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:09.080
so your bristol's your swansies your manchesters but if you go to wakefield wakefield up you know

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:16.040
small city next to leeds exactly the same wrexham exactly the same it's i mean to me as well i don't

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:21.960
know why we're continuing to push for retail why we're trying to keep this retail in newport dream

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:30.120
alive because everyone is shopping online let's turn it into coffee shops flats you know pubs

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:35.960
clubs venues and make it a social hub so that people can all still come into the town but not

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:41.320
to shop anymore to socialize and access culture let's build more galleries let's build more museums

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:47.320
let's build more music venues because people aren't shopping so why the hell do we keep

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:53.640
trying to force people to open shops that nobody wants to shop in it's just of the waste of that

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:57.880
this the massive buildings that are in newport center now are a waste let's let's let's access

00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:02.520
them culturally and then that way we can enrich every single person in newport's life because if

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:08.360
the city center was to become this incredible like free access arts point like i remember the

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:12.840
project space that we had that was the old sports shop that was incredible you could just wander in

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:17.080
and there was somebody had put something on the walls at some point we put some gigs on a couple

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:22.760
people put some photography exhibitions on we need more of that i mean i guess how do you

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.920
know how street is that you can keep you got to keep money circulating you know you got to bring

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:32.440
money into charge charge them for it people would pay to access culture if it was cheap enough

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:37.800
so but how do you think about newport how has it changed though sam for you in over the years is it

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:44.920
i don't know i think structurally it's changed but in terms of emotionally and and the support that

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:49.720
the arts and the culture aspect get it hasn't changed at all they've built a lot of big buildings

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:53.720
but there's still no support there would be the sum up the summation of what you know what i'm

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:59.560
trying to say there's nothing there for us we're still on our own as as in the pub we're still on

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:06.120
our own trying to trying to put the gigs on and the pandemic obviously has smacked hit the

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:11.640
shit out of you up i guess i mean the pandemic funding from welsh government was incredible

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:16.920
absolutely i cannot fault them for grassroots music venues it was phenomenal we actually came out with

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:22.920
a pandemic in a financially similar situation but with the recording studio in the basement and new

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:28.600
floors that we had been funded during the lockdown you know so it's it was quite good for us we

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:32.520
didn't you know at no point were we at risk of losing the venue because the welsh funding was so

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:39.960
great okay but just gonna over to gary ask him similar how do you think newport's changed and

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:46.840
um well i i wouldn't feel comfortable commenting on on what it's like now because i don't go out

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:51.080
and you know i visit family but i don't go into town very much although i have you know i it's

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:55.640
only been four years since you left no yeah i know and actually when i when i do go back when i when

00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:00.600
i you know do drive down the road and go back there i've been into town it's nice to see that

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:07.480
you know there's that that it that newport isn't existing in kind of this isolated you know sort of

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:12.040
bubble and they're at you know like in other places they're really nice little coffee shops

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:17.640
cropping up and and um you know little eateries and things like that and and that's that's always

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:22.360
nice to see but i but i agree with sam i mean my experience is that newport you know new buildings

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:28.280
cropping up and things like that but but what newport is to me is not like buildings or anything

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:34.760
like that it's about attitudes and and the people and and newport kind of newport does quite well

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:39.960
for it's you know maybe not financially but does quite well for itself as the forgotten underdog

00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:45.960
you know newport newport sort of grinds along that's what it does and that that's one of the

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:53.640
big attractions of it to me is like you know i mean i might not be easily identifiable anymore

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:58.360
as so so much as you know now i work in the arts and all that kind of stuff and

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:04.440
rather than signing on and getting pissed like i did in my teens and 20s now i you know i have

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:09.880
made quite a decent living for some you know in quite an i have quite an interesting job so

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:16.840
um but at the same time i do kind of feel that um i'm everything i am is because of my

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:23.560
newport upbringing and my newport you know formative years of teens and 20s yeah it's

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:31.560
absolutely made me who i am and um and everything i've achieved in my career i suppose is about um

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:37.880
just like putting your head down and getting on with it and working hard and like you know going

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:43.240
back to what sam said i mean you know the the pub's going to exist and bands are going to come

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:47.240
there and people are going to be creative and regardless of whether the arts council or

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:51.400
welsh government pays any attention and that's what newport and wales arts review was built

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:59.480
despite everybody you know books council arts council um you know wealth writers you know of

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:04.760
the of the generation up um all saying that like you know there's no space for what for what you're

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:10.920
doing there and 10 years later we're read by 250 000 people in 200 countries and it's and that's

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:15.400
because that the people who set up was actually from newport and i'm i'm absolutely convinced of

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.320
that and we just decided we're going to do this because it's what we want to do and we're going

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:25.960
to work hard at it and it's going to be brilliant and we're going to do it in spite of the naysayers

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:31.720
and the and being ignored by the people with the purse strings even though we do get public funding

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:37.560
but we had we i know that we had to fight 10 times harder than you know any magazine in

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:43.400
aberystwyth or bangor or cardiff for that matter um to get to get what we deserve i think i think

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.800
what gary says there in spite that's that's the important thing there is people in newport are

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:53.320
doing it in spite of the public funding that's available not because of it yeah it's a new port

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:57.720
it's a you know it's it is a new port attitude and i don't mean to be tribal about it but

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:01.960
living in calif as i do i'm really happy here we're all happy here but i do feel like i live

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:08.360
abroad you know i i don't feel like i'm living foreign country i do i absolutely do and and i

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:13.160
and i absolutely feel that way you know whether i'm walking down cabridge road and it's full of

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:18.600
you know middle working class voices and working class shops or whether i'm walking up to a bar

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.560
in pont canna and everybody sort of bbc middle class and welsh language and crackac and all that

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:28.520
you know i no matter where i am i feel like i'm visiting um and when it's interesting what you

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.720
just said actually because it reminded me of when i was young and and and the doll's first started

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:42.120
out because actually nobody gave a shit about any of the bands in south wales and you know once you

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:47.480
start to create a little scene and it's got value they start they start they start becoming

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.320
interested so it's actually about the whales out if you just make something that's good

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:57.160
and ignore everybody and they will eventually take notice yeah yeah young people are going to

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.360
be creative basically you know they're going to make music they're going to write they're going

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:07.640
to make art and and for the sake of it as well you know like we didn't we never set up the review to

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:13.480
make money it was because we wanted to um to write about stuff we wanted to be heard yeah

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.120
we wanted to have a voice and you know we'd all been to other places in wales and sent our stuff

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.840
in and there was no way in so set up your own thing and i think that obviously not exclusively

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:28.840
but there's a certain newport attitude to that is just like get it done and get it done now just do it

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.920
one of the things i was going to say which ties into something say i was saying earlier about um

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.840
how you know the noughties became slowly became the time in newport i felt that people just started

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.720
looking back on the 90s and that's an excellent point yeah but also it started to apologize

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:55.640
something yeah something that just was a kind of exciting time that's what i think that's when it

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:59.640
when it kind of happened but also something that i was only thinking about since i was thinking

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:06.040
about um coming and doing this podcast was um you know i used to dj um in the noughties in the

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.440
basement stuff like that i mean i you know i dj'd a little bit i was part of like four

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:18.280
team a four guy team of dj's and i was definitely fourth of the i'd prefer to be like out on the

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:24.520
floor i mean first best dj in newport but but one of the one of the things i was i was thinking

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:30.920
about was how um the kind of attitudes towards music i think in general may be changed in the

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:38.200
in the noughties um i was just kind of thinking about it and how it was kind of in in in the like

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.920
those last days of the big of the mega clubs which are all gone now apart from like in london

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:48.040
and manchester and stuff but those big mega clubs that are all closed now and clubs like the basement

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:53.800
which you know had like a 500 600 capacity or whatever it was and we used to dj it there and i

01:03:53.800 --> 01:04:01.320
and i'm thinking back on it like how uh there was a kind of snobbery about music which i saw change

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:08.120
through that decade whereas which had kind of sort of two things about it like like you know

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:14.440
buying the sort of 2006 2007 you could fill a dance floor playing whitney houston in an indie

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.440
club whereas there's no way you could have got away with doing that 10 years earlier but at the

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:23.080
same time like you weren't going to get any interest from playing you know like joseph k or

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:29.640
the bush tetras whereas you could have done that in 98 99 they were people who like you know had

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:34.600
their special edition rough trade stuff they knew those bands and people didn't you know you just

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:39.560
get people looking at you weird if you put anything like that on in so so there was kind of a flip

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:44.200
thing of like it was really cool that you could get away with playing just great pop music that

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.360
everybody loved and you didn't have to be ashamed of like i want to dance with somebody there's a

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:53.240
great floor filler you could actually play it in a dj set and nobody would be like throwing beer cans

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:58.920
at you um but at the same time there was a kind of loss of depth i think when it came to club music

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:04.520
like you know nobody was like oh my god you i can't believe you played that jam b-side

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:09.720
you know it was like it had to be the hits you know but um so i think the noughties was

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:16.280
tying in with that thing about it becoming an age of nostalgia it also kind of swapped a sort of

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:22.280
maybe musical snobbery gradually for something that was a bit more inclusive and then became like

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.320
eventually becomes like all you're playing is kook's naive and fucking kings of leon

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:32.760
and everything dies but but there was a moment there where you could play fiery furnaces and

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:39.720
whitney houston there was a moment there was a window and it was pure joy yeah um that's

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:46.600
something we still do on saturdays we we can literally flip and it's brilliant you can flip

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:56.680
from lizzo to jerry cinnamon to whitney houston to andrew wk to something else super cool a niche

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.680
and then back into paramour and as long as you chuck in some my chemical romance at the end

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.960
everyone's going home happy it's it's a saturdays are a very strange night in the club it's

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.320
it's called bangers and it doesn't matter what the genre is if it's a banger it gets played

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.960
i think that's to do with uh the death of try do you know have you heard of a writer called

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:19.480
barney hoskins anybody has a music writer that is before your time a big big writer the enemy

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:26.040
back in the day and i i got him in once to do a guest lecture for me and uh he's really

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:31.800
really smart barney and he kind of explained really well what he thought was like the death of

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.560
we call it the death of culture but he said culture now is just you know

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.320
they just have it you know it's just like there it is just big you know you know you know but

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:48.360
it's like like guy was saying he used to be some niche culture it's so much cultural capital

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.840
maybe i'm going at my own arse here but i just thought you know we don't need we can't kind of

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:58.280
relax and just become you know part of the white noise you have to have to have a voice you have

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:08.200
to kind of develop something interesting

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.420
you
