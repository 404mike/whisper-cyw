If you dread about that, or bad hearing it on the radio, but I would think when you saw it you realized how really bad it was.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I would think. It was awful. I mean it was awful to hear it, but when you saw the television pictures it was awful, wasn't it?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Tell me when you see pictures now. Television is good from that point of view. We realize what goes on much more than we would have.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Because years ago you would have heard it a week later when you were writing a newspaper, wouldn't you? But now you live with it, don't you?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Like the earthquake in New Zealand, you sort of see buildings falling. Well years ago you wouldn't have done that.
