00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
It was on the headland. I actually found it that morning. So we're just a trip and

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.920
yeah it was it looked like a log line. I wonder what's that you know just and coming up and down

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.640
slowly. When I got over it was as I said it was this minke well absolutely emaciated absolutely

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.480
you know nothing left of it dragging this sort of bit of a net looking like trawl net

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.920
you know if it sort of knows going back. We went out that day I think there was a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.160
who did I take out? I'd had another trip the next you know I think I went back in and picked up a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.880
trip and came back out. I'm trying to remember that you know he's in the 80s or 90s it was a

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:53.840
long time ago. I do remember Harriet Chapman was on the boat but I thought somebody else another

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.520
science pod was with me and then there's a die speed was on a speedboat the other side

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.760
and we found it again and then there was a search I think there was WDCS and Cliff Benson

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.880
pulled up some money together and did a bit of a search an aerial search for what they thought

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.480
they were going to do and they found it I've got no idea especially in a plane. That was hampered

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.720
by a lot of fog over the next couple of days and it just disappeared basically

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.200
there's nothing you could have done for it. It was trawl net it's quite heavy

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.720
it wasn't a fine monofilament it was that sort of orange quite thick you know of a trawl.
