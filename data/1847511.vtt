WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.520
okay so continuing yeah my son Christopher my son Christopher in school he played rugby and he was the winger and I know he came home and he was so excited he said to me he had a try I didn't have a clue I said well try harder next time

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:34.200
I didn't really cement him. So culture on both sides. Then he was saying his friend you know each day he laughed they've had a bit of ear missing something happened you know to them and I thought it was a dangerous game here and when he was

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:44.920
chosen to go abroad you know to America I said no you're not going because what I said no you've been telling me the injuries they've been having you're not going definitely not then he says to me look you missed my chance I could

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:57.360
have been a millionaire something like that now thanks to you you spoke my chances now that's what he used to say to me I said yes you might not have your ear missing all this I used to say to him

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:14.800
and also and culture got a lot because my father the attitude lot was the boys had to work and things like that so I had a bit of my parents attitude because my daughter apparently she's done very

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:33.600
well in Sweden well I know she passed all levels and things like that but how well you know I could have pushed her on you know to go to I didn't know about going to you know the university or like during school they have like

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:45.480
I never knew about that so you know since they were in school you know because my parents never once came to parents meeting anything like that

00:01:45.480 --> 00:02:10.120
so you basically you only knew what you experienced with our experience and you put on to you as a girl with mine then he went to um always racism in school my son and I remember when he was little

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:26.240
junior where he let say I live here in the school was like just down the crossroad and I walked through and he be I could see him outside you know standing by the door so I asked him what are you doing out there the teacher

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:53.280
I said what for he said because then he has to go to toilet and they won't let him go that's told him if you want to go to it should done it in break time and that he read himself and they kept him so went to school and I complained to the headmaster about it and I wanted to see her so with her with his teacher me and the headmaster so I said to him I asked my son and he told me that you will say to him that I am going to go to the toilet.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:13.280
They were not just him the whole class you got to if you want to go to it go at break time but then you know the little boys you know the boys like to play first and they come in and she was just punishing him you know and make him wet himself and keep him there she do it all the time.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:42.320
He was powerful so I said to him I asked my son and he told me exactly what happened I said you know and I know my son knocked on the door and said my son wouldn't do this or do that I said you know him and he wouldn't tell lies I said but you seem to be the type of person you are very quick to push it put a child down and make them out to be the liar and then headmaster went ladies ladies please let's not antagonize one another you know at that time.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:04:12.320
I noticed it then but then when he went on to the but what they do in school they put on a report on the child then to make the which was put on a terrible report on him because we went to their school then the teacher he had was awful he wasn't being taught English I can't remember how I found out but then I I found the school I went up to see the headmaster as it happened I knew the headmaster because he attended the same church in the same church.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:31.320
So I said to him I kept on phoning him but I didn't get nowhere they were actually putting him right in when I put him right in I had to reply the following they asked me to come in and then he said to me I said she's refusing to teach him English.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:57.360
I asked her why her excuse was someone like your son he's very good at maths when they go to maths they're no good at English I said that's the reason if he's been coming to school is to learn isn't it and the headmaster said don't worry missus has to leave it with me but what she did because he insisted she had to she had to teach him she went off sick rather than teach him.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.400
But he said don't worry about him I'll make sure you'll be okay but he did make sure he was okay.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:20.400
He sent him a program which he passed and sent him to college and when he went to college they gave him a program he passed put him through to university then you know so he kept his words out there.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:39.440
He was terrible the school racist then so when I met this chap I told him he came to me he was from Africa and I said to him about in Newport they're very racist there's no teachers there black teachers so I said to him because he took over there's a place called Jim GEMS.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:59.480
He said I can't grant minority support or something like that he was first of his kind in Newport I said well you've got the building I said if you can train if I get a group of people together get something to train them up to a level then go to school and teach.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:19.520
So he said right he said well I'll do I'll apply to the European for funding and I've got the space there and you just bring me the people so I did I got quite a few about 12 Caribbean people I was one and we taught English she got someone from London she was excellent and they was Caribbean.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:39.560
She was excellent teacher she really was she went through everything and she was so patient if you want to help with anything you know don't be afraid to ask you know but she got us through it and while she taught us when we did it then we had to go into various schools colleges as well.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:59.600
And we'd be assessed by it and marked as well by the teachers so we done all that we all passed but then while we're doing it as well well I found it but the Asian was coming then and in the schools now you find the more Asians now rather than it was taught English as a second language because I explained.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:16.640
As Caribbean even though you speak English is like pigeon English you know and when you're writing the grammar is not the same it is not whereas you know with the Asian they're going to school they get the help I want to win that's why they do better than this.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:34.680
And there was a server came around do we need that extra help and I said yes we needed it and I've booked in the community and there was the other ones no we speak English and all the old it's ridiculous they poo poo it and so that went by the wayside.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.720
Because I.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.720
But they do need you know what they definitely need definitely.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:58.720
The extra support they do yeah because you when you're writing doesn't flow so easy and then get your thoughts into chronic or the like you do need that support definitely.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:10.760
How important is it do you think for the next generation to hear and to know the stories of people like you and your parents and that kind of thing.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:24.760
I think it's very important to the top of definitely and I think they definitely that support in school as well they really do because it will help a lot that support you know in the region the writing.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.760
Why is it important.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:42.760
It's important for them to achieve later on you know in their adult to get good jobs you know and to be able to express themselves you know.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.760
Be their own voice as well they need a voice don't they.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:59.800
And they need someone to look up to as well in school and so there's no one they can look up to and who's a voice for them within the community.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:08.800
There's nothing here in Newport nothing at all you know where they can go and meet and support it's like for instance being ill as well there's no.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.840
There's nothing like within the in they've all got that support you know.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.840
They need a bit them they link need to go back as far as their country as well I think with their high commission them supporting them over here.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.840
Link it up.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.840
That's a good thing.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.840
Because with the Asian as well when they buy all this property they link it up with their government.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.880
So they link to the government back home and everything.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.880
Is there any other thing you'd like to say about.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.880
Britain about being British about feeling British or not feeling British do you feel more British or more Caribbean.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.880
The both.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.880
So you describe yourself as what.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.880
Ethnicity wise.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.920
Ethnicity wise.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.920
I would say black British.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.920
No matter where I go I'm open my mouth.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.920
Oh you're from Wales tell you're from Calif I was in St. Kitts as well.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.920
And this white girl came up to me she said to me and how well do the people how do they accept you here.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:37.960
And I'm saying kids with your accent as a what the speaking person they always say that to me always on the train you know they got all your go Shalibasi.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960
That's what they always say.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.960
Moment I open my mouth.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.960
Do you feel more Welsh or more British.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.960
Do you think there's a difference between being Welsh and being British.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
About a very racist.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Very very racist.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But I.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It's only now and all I realize because we're the younger I went to my friend's house before.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And she didn't let me know you know it won't be me anywhere.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I said why haven't you invited me.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:28.040
I invited straight away but she didn't know schools until it wasn't she wouldn't let to invite me and I realized then.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.040
I didn't have the time zone later on when you're growing up you realize these things.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.040
They didn't want to let me in.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.080
They didn't want you around.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.080
They didn't want to let me in.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:53.080
And I realized growing up that racism is not in the school.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:59.080
I define the mixture it starts within the home without that's a hundred percent the parents you know.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.080
Is there any hope is there anything we can do about that.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.120
I think they see.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.120
In the school is all just.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.120
In the white faces of the mixture.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.120
That would help as well because when I was teaching the school as well.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.120
I couldn't believe it.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.120
The teacher was doing something.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.120
She used the letter N.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.120
She chose a letter to the class names of the beginning with N.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.120
And they went.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.160
I was so I couldn't believe it.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
But the teacher didn't blink.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160
She acted with the children acted with something normal.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
So obviously something it was terrible.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.160
So I came back and went to I reported them.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.160
But they were worried because this chap came to see me which from the council.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
He said to me they're worried that you might take it further and all this.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.160
I said I'm not worried.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.200
Because this chap came to see me which from the council.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.200
He said to me they're worried that you might take it further and all this.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.200
I said I got no intention of taking it further.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.200
The person what I want.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200
I'd like it to go.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.200
I'd like it to go on a course.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.200
You know.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.200
And I'd like to be around to make sure she did go on that.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.200
But they said I couldn't be there and all this nonsense.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.200
It was gems.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.200
I don't know.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.200
But then then because that happened there was this what did they wear.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.200
It was in school.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.200
There was this blonde girl with blue eyes.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.200
She cut it's my it was my husband niece looks call me Antigua.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.200
They didn't realize we were related.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.200
So she started picking that she said oh she's.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.200
She seems to be tired in school.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.200
Do you think she's you know getting me to be negative but I just ignored her.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.240
Because in the school.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.240
During the breaks they.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.240
They talk so they talk about each child.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.240
Like I remember this little boy this mixed race boy and he was very bright and clever.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.240
And because he was mixed race they would always put him down in there.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240
And kept him down.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.240
So it's got a lot to do with them.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.280
With them.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.280
Is your background I think like and the judge you in school that he the judge you a lot.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.280
I know what to say.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.280
It seems that if you are a person of color.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.280
If you're non white that.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.280
The system is already gay against you so to make it.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.280
You have to work extra hard I guess.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.320
Is to the mentality.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.320
It's like it's institutionalized isn't it.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.320
In all these.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.320
When.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320
I will leave you to have your lunch.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.320
And I think I think this is how that feels.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320
Do you say anything else you want to say.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.360
Oh please don't forget to get in touch with them.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.360
The.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.360
Embassy first say in case the high commissioner with the flag please sink it.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.360
Because if I have the flag to go against you know my father you know my mother.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.360
I'm saying kiss me my mother's from sink it as well.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.360
I don't play on.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.360
The French room.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.400
I was very so good the chop I did it with.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:41.400
He he he was a Jamaican chap he'd never when he came over here.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.400
He didn't know about the French room because he came over late he came over.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.400
The late 60s and he never even had a French we never even owned this house.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.400
So everything what I told him is what I did and the names of my sisters as well.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.400
Okay.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.400
We wrote it together but he took it away.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.440
We wrote it together but he took it all into.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.440
Oh I was so annoyed when but I thought.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.440
You get.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.440
Do you do you have any of those things still like.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.440
Ground and all those kinds of things do you own anything.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.440
I never ever had no I wouldn't want anything like that.
