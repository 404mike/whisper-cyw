00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.400
I contemplate the talking stick, breathe with it.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.240
Ancestors connect, bent willow bows weave seductions,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.040
fingers fly to face and tap the paridians.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.680
Even though I carry grief, guilt, shame, my deep malignant blue-shaped pain,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.320
I can heal.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.040
Step into the dance.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.800
Feet root to earth, spirit soars celestial, wright moonbeams learn magic,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.560
fuel a metaconceptual mind flake within.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.640
Sculpt star shine with harmony, mosh with the weather by fire's fierce light.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.640
Begin.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.600
The thing about this poem is I haven't read it before, so normally my work is

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.600
memorised, they're not memorised. I'm a performance poet, look at YouTube,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.040
but normally work on the Comedy Circuit and Burlesque and spoken word a bit,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.440
but these are not really the most performancey things either.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.880
See, I'm making a lot of excuses. Someone told me never apologise.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.080
This is called Queen Mab.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.480
My real name is Plain, a sticker slapped on me as if on a lemon,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.840
something produced by my mother and given to my father a present,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.360
my birth name a token of her love for him, not for me.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.680
My real name is Hisnay, made female, you see, and it was a name that never quite

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.720
fitted like that pleated skirt, like that stiff school shirt, a thing put upon me,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.800
uncomfy and cosy, and all of the time, like the clothes they chose, I longed to pull it off.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.960
But like a sticker, one day it came loose, leaving me nameless, a nameless, a nothing,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.920
a newborn, a baby, a no one till something, a voice from my being within me came calling

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.960
my real self by her made, my real name by her named, my immodest mother, drunk woman queen,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.280
my goddess, my other, Queen Mab, for thee I am called, Queen of the underworld and of the poets,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.480
Queen of red mead, which I often find flowing, Queen of the walls, my true self still growing

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.080
in your image, though not the same, for I am still me and thou art still thee, though Mab,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.360
Queen Mab is my name.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:52.040
This poem arose as I drove home one evening after quite a busy day at work as a GP,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.240
and it sort of expresses a sadness that I felt that general practice is changing,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.440
as well as a sadness that day, and it's called energy for general practice.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:17.240
My Johan Wedimaru Hedu, Johan died today, his wife, a widow now, sobs on my shoulder.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.480
As I drive home, snow-tipped Welsh hills glow pink and the sun slips away.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.320
This land is full of ghosts and the multitudinous dead, whom we have loved and tended,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.920
come to their gates to greet me as I pass by.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.960
There once was an angel who fell asleep, so deep asleep inside of me.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.400
I searched and I searched around and about, what seemed like forever and a day,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.600
when along came a true love who had the key that fitted right there inside of me.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.360
I opened my eyes, I opened my heart, and I wondered and wondered, where can I start?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.880
I have so many a tune to sing, so fair a melody to me.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.800
So fair a melody to make a thring. Oh, where did you come from, my little thing?

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.360
I think I remember. Child of my body that lights the spring, the well of knowledge,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.760
the fountain pours forth, my being soars. The angel of music lies asleep no more.
