00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520
Farah Alibi recording Sophia Johnson on the 18th of April 2024. Sophia can you

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.720
introduce yourself please. My name is Sophia Johnson I was born on the 14th of

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.880
July 1956 in Nairobi Kenya. You were born in East Africa can you tell me your

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.840
memories of living there? Sure, sure. Even though I was born in Kenya we were

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.360
British East Africa then and my family moved to Tanzania, Mwanza to start a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.440
business or my grandfather did and we had soda factories in Mwanza and Arusha

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:54.560
and we also owned some land which we didn't quite rent to to the local

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.320
population but let them farm their food there to sell to the market so nothing

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.920
was there was no money to be made from that but it was land. Can I ask you about

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:16.320
how your family went from Kenya to Tanzania? I think my grandfather decided

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.840
he wanted to go to Mwanza to start a business. I can't recall it because

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.280
obviously I wasn't there but that was all my both no not my parents my father

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.040
my grandmother my grandfather were all born in Kenya but then they left to go

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.120
to Tanzania and I don't know the reason why. But you were born in Kenya? Yes. And so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.360
how old were you when you when your family left Kenya? Oh immediately well my mother I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.520
think was visiting from from Mwanza and of course I was born in Kenya but then

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.640
you know we were just East Africans there was I just a little permit to say

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.400
you were East African there was no passport per se in that time or if I

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.560
remember. So you could leave and go to one country there was a lot of fluidity in your

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.440
movement. Yes. Do you know what your family did in Kenya before moving to Mwanza?

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.840
They had a little factory a soda factory. In Nairobi? In Nairobi I believe but I

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.720
don't know nobody talks about that time anymore you know all I know is my my own

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.640
personal recollection of Mwanza. The family didn't talk about any of our

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.240
where we came from what we did what happened all I know is about we were in

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.080
Mwanza and that was that. So does that mean that you don't have any historical

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.680
knowledge of your ancestors how your grandparents came to India? No. Sorry East

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.160
Africa. Yeah. Because that's very common with our community. Yes. Nobody actually

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.200
remembers. No. I mean great great grandfather was 10 when he came to East

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.560
Africa but that's all I know and of course it's great great great. So you

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.600
would have been fourth generation? Yes. So that's a long established line in East Africa? Yes.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.680
By that point? Yes. I mean we were Africans we didn't never thought of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.640
ourselves as Indians because this was home. Home was never India. My mother was

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:20.960
born in Tanzania exactly so we were all Africa East Africans and of course

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.640
things changed. So can you tell me some of the memories you have of Mwanza then?

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.400
It was a lovely lovely town on the shores of Lake Victoria. Beautiful. Very

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.080
colonial. My grandfather was very big in the British colonial government. When you

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.600
say big? He was a it was a member of the Legislative Council in the British

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.160
government representing the Indians in East Africa in Africa in Tanzania. And so

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.840
when you say it was very colonial? It's a very colonial town you know a lot of

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.240
British there. I have no clue why but you know in those days you were not as

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.560
Indians or Africans you were not allowed to go into British facilities if you

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.600
know that you know you couldn't go into the clubs you couldn't go into the yoke

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.680
clubs into the golf clubs not allowed. So there was segregation? Of course

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.400
absolutely. But was it segregation with whites only? Were Indians and

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.040
Africans mixing or you able to go into each other's? We could go into it we

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.680
could go into brown and black communities but not in white. So it really was?

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:41.520
They were colonial until they left in 1960 and so even then even after 1960 we still had the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.560
clubs where they allowed Indians in but not Africans. Why do you think Indians

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.360
were allowed in? Business people. Okay. And and because my father my grandfather was

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.960
in the government we were kind of honorary whites. Now I was I was very

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.240
young then so I don't remember I remember going to dances at the club you

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.080
know my grandmother was entertaining these ladies with their beautiful silver

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.640
and whatnot I I remember all that cutlery which came from Sheffield and

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.600
what then be I can't remember what it was we only saved one piece after what

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.520
happened in you know after what happened in 1971. Okay. We had a beautiful home huge

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:37.280
home family lived together the soda factories were in town and actually I

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.000
had a very privileged life I must say a very happy life. So you grew up in this

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.520
big house yeah and with this special status within that yes yes that gave

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.280
you access yes privileges and to white people basically in white society yes

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.120
and you imported cutlery from the UK yes and the crockery and you know so that it

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.520
was very much trying to be to the British standards yes yes and did your

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.880
grandmother wear her saris or was she dressed western western dress so would

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.320
you describe it as a complete copy of the colonial culture? Yes I would think so

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.400
with my grandfather certainly after my grandfather died she went back to wear

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.920
wearing her long dresses and a sari you know on her head. So it was because of your

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.880
grandfather that your grandmother actually wore western clothes? Yes.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:38.000
Into that particular society of that world which was totally different from

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.600
our world and then the African world. But it was enabling you to have a quality of

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.320
life yes that you wouldn't have had otherwise no if you had stayed in saris

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.600
Yes because we were encouraged can I say this by the Aga Khan the old Aga Khan that

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.520
where you go into whichever country you go assimilate don't you know and start

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.640
wearing western clothes and because my grandfather was also president of the

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.560
Ismaili council so my grandmother started wearing dresses then all the

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.600
women followed her into a dress is not properly not not too short obviously

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:25.640
modest dressing but no saris or anything no. So did your grandmother did you sense

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.640
that your grandmother felt really quite comfortable being western or was she

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.320
always aware that she was never a westerner? I don't think she was but in

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.640
her heart she was always Indian but she was born in Kenya I mean you know she

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.040
never been to India in her life either so there was a culture but the culture

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.920
obviously that culture from India was brought into us you know to the food to

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:54.800
speak the language it was important but we were always kids in our family were

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.520
always taught to speak English have western food we were never allowed

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.880
Indian food it was totally different because it was a very strange household

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.560
where we there was a kids dining room there was an adults dining room I never

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.880
I think I went into the adults dining room once and then my grandfather would

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.760
hold all these sundowners on our terrace upstairs where the people were invited

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:25.360
when Princess Margaret visited sundowner when Hajjuan came sundowner he came to

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:33.160
our house I've got pictures. So you have your family hosted royalty? Yes. This

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.480
colonial contact yeah so your grandfather's really really high up. He was awarded the

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:46.800
MBE by the Queen for services to the British Empire. So it was very necessary

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.480
for you to fit in into the colonial system? Yes. How do you feel about that

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:59.160
retrospectively? Well I never thought that there was snobbish and you

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.280
know I've also lived in different countries now and you see the English I'm

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.800
sorry to say this when they're out there they sort of develop this inverted

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.240
snobbery and you may be a it's nothing but you think you know with the posh

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.520
voices I never you know I never actually thought of them as well okay skins

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.440
different so what. So the fact that your grandfather was part of this colonial

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:32.240
system yes that was causing a lot of inequality yes in East Africa yes do you

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.480
have any thoughts or feelings about that having belonged to it and grown up with

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:43.120
it? Well actually I didn't belong in a way when he died in 1960 not 1962 he died

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.240
then things start changing. And how did they start changing? Because after after

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.600
the after independence the British were going and you know we were there then

00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.000
not many not many British then some who obviously working elsewhere but you know

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.840
we used to have a another beautiful colonial home in a place called Musoma

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.400
we used to go on our holidays there and every month of December we'd take the

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.240
car and go all the way to Uganda Kenya Tanzania through the Serengeti and back

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.440
to Monsa it was it was a that's what it was it was an idyllic life in a way my

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:26.240
father was lovely he loved adventure but then things start changing in 19

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:32.600
Nyerere became president and he decided to adopt the Chinese socialist way of

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:38.160
life where nothing belongs to you everything belongs to the state. So just

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.760
before we talk about that just so that I can grasp your life in the first 10

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:50.480
years of your life yeah yeah it was sundowners it was long vacations long

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.960
vacations sundowners obviously we weren't allowed these kids but we'd watch

00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:01.460
you know road trips and holidays what about your schooling was that private? No no no we were at the

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:09.160
Aga Khan school and remember in December yes yes so that the educational system

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:17.720
was an elitist in that sense. But not Africans. No Africans? Only Indians. And only Indians? Yeah at the Aga Khan school yeah. So only Asmaelites?

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:24.040
mm-hmm no other yeah other other other Hindus and other races but no Africans

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.680
okay so if I can remember I don't think there were any Africans. Other religions so

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.520
that you could be Hindu Sikh? Yeah we used to go to the Hindu temple we used to go for

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.040
Diwali, Holi we used to go to the marriages and it was very very togetherness

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:45.800
you know it was a lovely life in a way because there was no hassle. What about

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.280
your friendship group because you have this grew up with these British

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.080
affiliations yeah were you friends with those white colonial children? No. Or did you

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.760
stay with the Asians? No we only met them in clubs you know in the clubs when we

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.160
went swimming or play tennis or that but no but most of my friends were

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.960
Asmaelites because it was a community was a centre of heart but our family was

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.600
very aloof people didn't like us very much because they thought we were very

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.560
apathy so if we'd go to the movies we'd have the first row of the cinema that's

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.960
what I'm saying you know kind of royalist so people were scared to come

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.000
in fact people were scared to come and talk to us and I said why won't you have

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.720
got many friends you know because they were actually not happy to talk to us

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.800
they wouldn't come to the big house they were scared and I just wondered why and

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.680
then coming to the UK and meeting them again they said you know we never came

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:49.120
to your big house why because it didn't feel right so no the my friends were my

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.680
cousins cousins group of three or four cousins and that was our group and so

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.840
there was no mixing with Africans not at that stage no and then in

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:09.560
1970 when this I was it now at secondary school in what you call my third year

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.400
was that in Ismaili secondary school no no it was it was a it was called Moanser

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.400
secondary school so it was mixed what whites Africans most of the whites went

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:25.560
to their own private school there were a couple who came but mainly Asians Indians

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:32.760
and then the Africans came as well so it was pretty mixed but that was an

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:40.520
interest that's when things really started changing because they nationalized

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:49.640
everything I'm going now into I was 13 at the time I was in secondary school and

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:55.360
and the year before that they nationalized because everything belonged

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.280
to the state so up until that point your grandfather passed so he was no longer

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.680
part of this colonial no it was all gone so it was just the family were just

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.000
working in the business yes which was the pop factory yeah we just know Coca

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.920
Cola Coca Cola hmm any other no so there was a Coca Cola factory yeah you

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.680
still had the land which Africans were living on yes there was no rent being

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:23.960
charged no thanks so that was great yeah then nationalization happened in 1970

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:33.360
after the independence yes 1971 yeah and then yeah so one night I could hear the

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.200
adults kind of getting very uppity things was tense and but you know as a

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.120
child nobody tells you what's going on oh you go to school it's fine but we

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:50.560
were always escorted to school always escorted back by we had drivers security

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:57.320
people and then my father decided oh so one day I'm coming home from school and

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:04.080
I see this big notice is saying property of the Tanzanian government and this was

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.240
on our house notices on our house so by that time they would have taken the

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:14.880
factory was the last to go because there was a big discussion between Coca Cola

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.840
and and government of Tanzania they wouldn't allow it eventually they took it

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:26.520
that's when my father left to go back to Kenya so you were saying about going

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.960
home from school yeah and I see all this notices now and Swahili so and then after

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.280
the time we were not allowed to speak Gujarati or English we had to speak

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.760
Swahili all the time if you were caught speaking those two languages don't you

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.600
in trouble everyone had to have the property of the president in their house

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:51.240
you are you have to go to every compulsory rally political rally if you

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:57.760
didn't turn up you were done for in school English went out of the window

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.600
everything was Swahili and army training we had to go over we had to go running

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:09.920
and beautiful tennis courts were made into fields of rice you know farming we

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.400
had to go in the fields and and dig for like I remember being deep in water

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:21.680
digging for rice in a paddy field as as teenager I was 13 and this was something

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.200
that everybody did yeah yeah and if anything happened they would blame the

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.200
Indians you know the Africans then of course they're the top end now I mean

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.400
they were oppressed you know that don't blame them they're the top hands at

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.960
school if they made if they made any mischief or the school the headmaster

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:45.560
was an army guy everybody was military and and if you if you make that they

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.160
made any mischief and then the headmaster was very strict it came in

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.720
and said okay who was it they would say the mohindi's the Indians and the only

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:01.880
three of us and we get punished really badly how would they punish you we had

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:08.920
to stand in the dug-up tennis court with stones in our hand in hot weather like

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:15.080
that for an hour arms outstretched yeah yeah yeah and then if you did that they

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:20.080
smacked you in the bum with a big cane oh yes it wasn't it wasn't very nice

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:26.520
that's when by this time my father has left to go to Nairobi because we'd lost

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.040
everything there was nothing there was some money saved there was nothing my

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:36.080
sisters were at school in boarding school in England I was the only one

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:42.160
left to go to boarding school but of course it wasn't going to happen so my

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.520
father was working in Nairobi I was working for as an accountant in

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.680
somebody's garage I can't remember the garage name anyway but it was a garage

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.720
so your father left you yeah and mother yeah with grandmother with grandmother

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:02.480
and certain certain other cousins but everybody else left some to go to Canada

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:10.320
some to come to England so it was only me my mother says just get out you know

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:16.000
because there was no future for the kids we had to go so my uncle went to

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.480
Vancouver with his children my aunt went to Vancouver they all left and some

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:32.320
some cousins came to the UK so then he had to get me out so he then the

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:38.440
that's when my adventure started because one day in school I was a cousin of mine

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.600
came it was lunchtime he said your mother said a really terrible accident

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.520
could be fatal we need you to come to the hospital and I was allowed out and

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:53.920
and I was and I said where we going that's not the way to the hospital he said no

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.680
you're going straight to the airport stuck a piece of paper in my hand it was

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.760
like a permit I wish I'd had it now which permit and said you're getting on

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:13.320
that plane go I didn't see my mother nobody you know nothing

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:22.680
whatever I had because because there was apparently now I found this out later

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:29.480
that there was a rumor that the members of that particular party they were called

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.840
TAMU Tanzania I can't remember but they were called T-A-M-U I cannot remember

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:40.120
they were they wanted to marry young Indian women you know we never

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.360
assimilated that we were friends that we would bring but we never married or we

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:49.960
kept our own community but then in Zanzibar particularly they abducted

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:55.240
young Indian girls and married them and there were six year old men with 13 14

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.640
year old girls so there was a rumor that they were going to do the same to us and

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:06.800
that's why they got me out so I was gone so you boarded that plane yes and then

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.520
we end up in Entebbe Airport so it didn't go straight to Nairobi it went to

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:18.040
enter it's a plane and it went to enter at that time Idy Amin was there as you

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:25.400
remember and we get out and this big big soldiers if you I mean sure you might

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:31.080
remember but you're too young bubbly huge huge soldiers they surrounded me

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:38.560
and said you under arrest why well the permit is all wrong or something anyway

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.240
they took me into this room and I said I said I'm that I mean 13 year old you

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:53.440
know fortunately there was a doctor on the plane who knew my family he must

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.600
have bribed them or something because he said he came to the room and said that

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.680
let's go let's go there's a jet waiting he's gonna take us to Nairobi and we

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:07.120
stopped doing Asian doctor Asian doctor was Ismaili or no Hindu no he was Muslim

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.640
doctor I mean and he just grabbed me and said let's go you know and we got on the

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.640
plane and I remember him giving me a glass of whiskey which I'd never had in

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.280
my life he said drink this I said what happened what happened he said just just

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:28.400
sit we are safe we are leaving you were a VC 10 I still remember it so vividly

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.080
running in the on the runway you'll see this big plane there anyway I get to

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.800
Nairobi and he said there's your father there I just fell into my father's arms

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.320
I said what the hell happened there he said it's fine you're safe now I've got

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.320
you booked in a school here but we must send you to England to join your

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.840
sisters but then he said to me there was no money so I'd have to do my own thing

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:59.160
you know I'd get I'd get a student visa to England to learn to where my sisters

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:04.560
lived but obviously I couldn't go to boarding school or university so that

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:09.360
was quite a lot to take on yeah a teen year old you know where's my mother yeah

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:15.120
where am I where am I what am I doing what am I gonna do and I said am I

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.840
living with you and he said oh no because I'm living in some lodgings you've

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:27.240
got to live with these people those strange people but I cried because you

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:33.600
know I didn't know who they were my home life in a few days was just gone did you

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:39.480
talk to your mum at all over that time I didn't I had it I didn't ever my mum was

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:45.800
too busy doing charity work I never actually had a relationship with my

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:51.760
mother I was more I was brought up by my grandmother and my aunts mother never

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:57.000
featured so as far as I was concerned she was my biological mother no I never

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:05.120
I didn't see her until I was 19 so yes so then I went to the Aga Khan Academy

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:12.000
in Nairobi and how was that for you it was great great again mixed did you feel

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.880
that you had recovered from that instance from moving from Tanzania yeah I

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.320
didn't feel anything I didn't I I mean once I got into school and my cousin

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.080
joined me at the school I was happy because my cousins were there in Nairobi

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:31.040
my cousin worked at the Aga Khan Hospital he was the chief accountant so I

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:37.360
had people I could be with you know and I made some friends in in in Nairobi and

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:44.640
then my dad said okay time to go to December 71 time to go to England you

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.720
know your visas already he'd got me a pop-up passport I didn't have this piece

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:55.400
of paper and I was on my way to England were you 1971 with the Ugandan Asians

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.720
actually it was British Caledonian I remember and he stopped over it was a

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:06.720
direct flight from Nairobi to Gatwick but it had a puncture problem or tire

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:12.160
problem so it had to stop over in Antebe I mean oh my god I'm back in Antebe you

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.520
know oh I'm so dead but I didn't get off the plane and then there's loads of

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.840
other Asians got on the plane I wonder what they're doing you know and I

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:27.000
remember it's Christmas time and Christmasy time and we got lentil

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.600
curry and rice for lunch on the plane yeah but you had no idea that there was

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:38.680
this expulsion going on so those Asians that were on the plane to Britain were

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.560
being hosted yeah on British Caledonian yeah with lentils and rice yes and

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:48.200
there's me thinking what is this place so full of Indians you know for Asians and

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.520
then I asked somebody I said why would you know you have me I said yeah he

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.080
people have all been kicked out everybody's out or who are British

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:03.720
subjects are out he wants us all gone how old were you then 14 how did that

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.920
make you feel when you heard that on the plane I was shocked and there's me going

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:15.440
you know to the UK I was I was I until later on in life I found out what

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.200
happened to us in Tanzania to me it was like a big adventure you know apart from

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.760
being arrested in Antibes but you know I said oh where am I going what am I

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:28.240
doing yes I was homesick from Monza but I said I would never go back you know

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:35.280
it'd be too hurtful but yeah so I'm getting off the plane get it get to the

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:43.280
man so this is how you came to the UK was to be expelled from Tanzania in a way

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:48.560
expelled in a way but you know left of my own accord really yeah oh you know

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:54.600
economic migrant if you encouraged encouraged to leave yeah entry yeah and

00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:00.000
with your father this idea of Britain being a better place for you yes my

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.600
father loved Britain he he'd been here he lived here for four years in the 60s

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:12.200
and he loved it but then his family dynamics he never business he never went

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:17.960
back but my sisters were here already do you think the early colonial family

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:24.560
experience was an influence on you your father wanting the they were in a very

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:31.480
nice boarding school in Sussex you know I mean they weren't in some weird place

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.560
and you were already familiar with the culture to some degree yes to come to

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:48.320
the UK I was so used to the Queen's English that when I heard dialects and

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:56.400
and and and then I went to my sisters then my sister lived in Stevenage she

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.720
was a teacher then she qualified met children you in that way in that sense

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.760
yes but I hadn't seen them for such a long time I didn't recognize them at

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:14.760
the airport my oh oh god five six years seven years so you you landed in Gatwick

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.440
yeah came out and they and your family were to meet you yeah looking and

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.960
looking for my two sisters and then I saw them because I never had a

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.520
relationship with my sisters either because they'd left my older sister left

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:34.320
in 63 to come in the you to the UK my other sister left in 67 so I didn't know

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:41.640
my siblings really and then we went I said oh where's the snow this you have

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.320
this sort of Dickens type of in you know the up impression I said what's now

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:51.280
anyway we get back and they said listen you're not going to boarding school

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:55.680
because daddy has no money there's no money so you can go to the further

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:01.320
education college and do your own levels which is what I was doing in Nairobi but

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.600
you know the education in the UK and education in Kenya totally although we

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.840
did do the Oxford and Cambridge exams different different type of teaching but

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.360
anyway I did six old levels in six months which was a shocker you know I

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.880
don't know how I did it and then my father said look you've you've lost out

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:26.520
from the way your sisters have been taught in boarding school I would have

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.480
liked you to go to boarding school but unfortunately there's only enough money

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:37.240
for your sister to do pharmacy at at University and what would you do because

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:41.880
you are T and I said well I could do classic so you know and he said yeah

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.600
but what would you do after that she'd earn money you what would you do what

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:52.640
was what's the future for you and I said right well let's have the money and give

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:58.360
me some and I applied to this very posh college secretarial college in Oxford to

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.760
do a secretary's course do you remember the college name Oxford and County

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.520
Secretarial College it's now gone unfortunately but there's a ladies call

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:13.360
very strict oh you have to wear twin set pearls and we lived in the boarding

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:19.120
house and there were girls from every colonial you know and there was

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:24.160
discrimination I'll tell you because I was the only brown person there was a

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:31.120
Ghanaian ambassador's daughter so people the parents of these girls

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.880
complained that they did not because there were four to a dormitory and there

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.480
were two to a room you know for and we went the four and the next term when we

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:44.360
went up me and Josephine I remember her were in the same room because the

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:49.800
parents of those girls had complained that they did not want us to be in the

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:56.560
same room as we were not white that was my first sort of experience you know of

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:03.880
being what it was weird anyway we find life goes on you know carry on did you

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.840
feel that the secretarial college was actually hostile no they were they were

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:13.200
they actually took um they took they took the way angry with the parents but

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.440
what can you do you know when the parents are paying masses of money but

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:23.480
yeah but we only I only found out from one of the girls that that girls parents

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:33.000
girls parents objected anyway so we were I finished my secretarial course and and

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.760
we were headhunted by the BBC or the Foreign Office well I couldn't go to the

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.760
Foreign Office because I wasn't a British citizen then I was Kenyan so the

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:54.120
BBC wanted me but I was too young I was only 16 so they said go away for a year

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.480
but come back we have a job for you and they would get me the work permit so I

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:07.120
did that and then went to work for the BBC World Service after after after one

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:13.720
year out I lived in I went to went to Manchester where my sister lived she'd

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.640
married by then and she they'd moved to Manchester because her husband got a job

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.800
in the nuclear something or the other she's a nuclear engineer was he British

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:32.720
British bring and I went to live with them in Manchester outside Manchester

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:39.480
and I went to college there for a year and did English lit literature just

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.640
past the time really because I was just waiting for the BBC so was it unusual

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:49.880
for your sister to have married a British person no because we had already

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:58.280
had British people in in my cousin married a British guy the Congo cousins

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:06.080
all married Belgians so no and when I met my husband there was no problem my

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:11.480
grandmother my grandmother were first cousin to Mary when she brought her then

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:16.880
boyfriend home from England there was a lot of opposition and he could marry her

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:23.360
on the condition that he converted to Islam which he did so and my grandmother

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:28.800
said listen times are changing we can't be enclave into our own little you know

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:35.040
bit of society you've got to get out and if the kids want to marry out yes let

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.920
them so your grandma was with her sounds like she was quite forward-thinking yes

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.640
she was and not dogmatic about no religious and cultural practices being

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.800
kept in the family absolutely very liberal and you know she was strict she

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.560
was a strict grandmother but she was she was a good grandmother I would say where

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.840
would she've gotten this from my grandfather ideas from my grandfather

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:05.240
who was on board the colonial recommendations of the other cars yeah oh

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.160
yeah because he used to correspond with him all the time I mean unfortunately I

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.360
don't have it I don't know where it's gone I think there's some letters in my

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:24.040
drawer from from him from the young and the old yeah that's that's really quite

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:32.600
something yes and my grandmother was very big in some you know we have all

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:37.480
these little societies she was very big in something we used to get people

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:49.760
coming to the house and very secret to secret very Masonic and that's when

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.360
the young other when he was visiting in 1957 I wasn't born obviously but there's

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.800
a picture down there of him and you will see my grandmother looking at him and

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:06.560
when he came in 79 or something and she went up on the stage for we thought it

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:12.360
was in Elscourt here in London and she went up and he beamed at her and he was

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:17.520
like I said I said to my sister look at that he's beaming at her as if he knows

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:25.680
her you know he didn't know her he hasn't changed so yes and blessed her and blessed her

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:31.240
oh he was like it was with her for a long time it was really interesting and

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:38.680
when she died in Canada there was the aga Khan the mice like tripped over her

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:45.000
so she was important so despite the colonial aspect it was a very close

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.120
connection to the Ismaili Muslim culture absolutely yes and community yes yes we

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.720
followed all the traditions I mean you know it's a different world for the kids

00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:00.960
because we had you know we were doing everything but the adults yes very much

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:09.200
so Jamaat Khana every day all the all the functions everything big donations

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:15.040
and he built a big Jamaat Khana in Mwanza yeah all influence of my

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.680
grandfather and our family fundraising things like that but obviously I was too

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.360
young and I wish my parents had told me all this because they never talked about

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:29.160
it ever. And was that out of an act of humility?

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.520
Yeah well that also and also I think my mother was so hell-bent on sending us

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.920
three girls because you remember the hierarchy that you're patriarchal you

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:43.480
know if you didn't have a son my grandfather was titled it was my

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:52.360
countryman it's my title and and obviously if my if my father had a son

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:57.280
the thing would pass to him but my father had three girls and he was always

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.760
this thing about you know his younger brother had a son so it was still very

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:08.200
patriarchal but anyway my mother was hell-bent that us three would get an

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:14.600
education you know and if they not to marry because otherwise what like I was

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.200
thinking what life would have been like if I was still in Africa would I be

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.440
married with two three children but no education you know what what would my

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:28.820
life have been like I don't know and here my mother say out you know she

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.900
wouldn't even teach us how to cook I said can you teach us how to cook no no

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:38.040
go study study I want you to get out I want you to go and get educated so you

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:43.680
stand on your own two feet you never depend on anyone ever where do you think

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.720
that came from that drive for independence to not even be my mother I

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:53.000
think my mother she came from a very high-class family in Dar es Salaam and

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.440
she married my father was a bit of a lout her words and when she came when

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:05.080
she married my father and she came to this Dar es Salaam was very sophisticated

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:11.160
and her sister-in-law her brothers they lived in South Africa so they were very

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:16.960
sophisticated and when she came to this little thing called Mwanza yes the big

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:22.120
house wasn't built then it was a little it was a little house you know tend to

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:27.360
tend to a space and the toy and she was like her trousseau was all from South

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:32.280
Africa silk and stuff and I said sister-in-law's all took it you know like

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:39.360
they were all my mother she did tell me they were so nasty and there's me

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:44.800
coming into this thing and we used to have a huge house in Dar es Salaam her

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:51.120
father ran hotels in Dar es Salaam and then she comes into this thing and she

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:56.440
thought that's it if I have any children they will never suffer what I went

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.680
through they'll go they'll be out gone independent never needing anyone to

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:06.760
rely on so which is she depending on my father didn't she and she was 21 years

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:11.960
old so by Indian standards she was too old to be some you know should have

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:16.120
married at 18 or 17 and there was my father she only saw him and she went

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:21.680
ill I said really I said I never want you to go through that again and that's

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:27.640
why out no I said but you never taught us how to cook she said now I said I

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:33.080
can't cook you know and she said that's fine you just study independence I want

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.320
you to have your own house your own thing never depend on anyone even your

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:43.800
own husband never that was a thing because of what she'd been through yes

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:50.760
and how do you how is that informed your life going forward as you moved through

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:56.680
living in Britain independent I mean yes I've married but I'm if you ask my

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:01.960
husband I'm totally my own person you know if he tells me grow your hair I'll

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:07.480
get it short that sort of thing it will not you know I respect him I love him

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.920
but he'll never ever take over my life or make me dependent on him I'm my own

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:18.680
person your mother could be called an Asian feminist in that sense and that's

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:23.160
something there's not really recognized in the West that no we have as Asian

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.240
women have gone through our generational struggles in different ways

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:32.080
liberated ourselves yes I mean I have obviously have family who are quite

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:37.640
narrow-minded my sister who was in her six seventies now young middle sister

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.440
has never married and my mother used to get things like you know oh look at your

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.080
daughter she's never married and the mother so she's got a business

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:50.160
multi-million business she's her own free woman if she wants to marry tomorrow

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:56.760
she can nothing to do with me don't tell me she was she was good like that so she

00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.760
really went against the cultural norm yes or she had to listen to all the

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:06.600
she had to listen to all the taunts and the you know the hypocrisy or your

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:11.080
daughters you know look at them they married white people it was like that

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:18.240
with certain members of the family and community so that idea of being single

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.320
or marrying outside of the community the being independent are all things

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:27.800
that were frowned upon yes but my parents didn't care and that would you

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.680
say that that belonged more to Indian culture Indian as opposed to taking on

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:43.040
the doctrines of Ismailism difficult is my reason I would say that they took

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.600
that your parents took on their doctrines of Ismailism above and beyond

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:52.960
the Indian culture yes yes so tell me you were headhunted by the BBC yes I

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:59.520
worked at the World Service in the Swahili service and I was there for ten

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:05.320
years were you speaking Swahili then but you didn't have to really you know but

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.480
they got me a work permit in the meantime I'd met Michael at Oxford while

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:14.260
I was in Oxford at the college because the whole idea of going to that

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.060
college was to very rich Oxford graduates when I didn't I married a

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:22.860
decorator you know working-class decorator I mean his parents had never

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:27.700
seen a brown person ever the village was not very sort of you see this in

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.900
Midsomer murder you know you do so and and I said to Michael but you're gonna

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:36.040
meet I can I'm gonna meet your parents and he said yeah what's wrong and I

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:41.660
said well look at me I'm not white and he said yeah but they wouldn't mind and they

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:46.860
didn't and I was like oh and mr. Johnson his father was a Halifax

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:54.620
working-class man I'm really lovely I doled him and mother she used to very

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:59.340
strong woman again used to be well spitfires in the war you know and

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:04.580
independent again very independent of her husband taught her two sons well and

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:11.860
I married Michael and and I said to my mother you know did you I asked her one

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:15.860
she said the only time I thought about you marrying Michael is what color would

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:21.780
your children be that's about how I don't know might have been right might

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:26.900
have been wrong who knows I mean she adored my nephew who's quite brown you

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:31.260
know but he said that's the only thing I thought I never thought oh you know and

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:36.860
I was accepted by their family they never made me feel that I was you know I

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:43.380
was I was not different but you know talking to French talking to certain

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.700
friends especially in Wales they would say to me I would say but I'm the same

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.060
color as the person you are abusing and they go yeah but you're different you

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.820
talk differently you wear different clothes I said yeah but I'm the same

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:01.980
that's my culture I really should be doing that but I don't I said if you

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:08.060
came and saw me in a in a hijab or whatever would you be abusive good

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.980
answer my question that's really interesting that's very interesting you

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:16.340
know you're different that's all I could hear you're different you speak

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:21.380
differently you wear different clothes you're not like them just is the

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:27.380
inference then you're British overtly British you you presents as being

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:33.340
British as opposed to Indian or Pakistani or yes you know in your

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:38.140
traditional dress yes in your accents yes in the way you speak English yeah

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:45.340
in your manners in my mannerisms that I'm I'm British yes but I wear Indian

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.900
garb I wear I put henna on my hands oh there's a oh what's this have you got a

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:54.180
disease I don't know it's you know it's like a tattoo except that it's not

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:59.540
prominent don't be ignorant I said we live in a very global world now try

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:05.100
understand us but you know what is never gonna happen is it I mean my nephew was

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:15.580
now in his 40s has been racially abused he's very conscious of his color is our

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:21.340
coloring whereas my niece is very white with blondish mousy hair so he's dark

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:27.340
he swarthy has a very good job with Virgin Atlantic but even now he'll say

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:32.020
why are you living somewhere where there are no brown people why can't you live

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:37.540
with us I said well I like it here I like it here for the peace and quiet I'm not

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:43.580
concerned about what's out there you know and where is here in Manchester

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:48.340
okay because there's a big community there no I meant is why aren't you

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:54.980
living why am I living here in Wales in this in this enclave so of white people

00:44:54.980 --> 00:45:00.540
so before we get into how you've got to be into Wales this is such a fascinating

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:07.380
story you were living in England I'm interested that you didn't apply for

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:11.220
citizenship when you arrived in the UK was that because it was not available

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:16.460
not available I would have to be I would have to be here for five years drop at

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:23.940
that time to then apply for British nationality but I married and I married

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:28.220
at the age of 19 I married Michael so that kind of took care of itself that

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.660
because you did it on in those days you became automatically became a British

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:36.780
citizen except that when we went to the home office this was funny and Michael

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:41.780
saying because he'd never seen Jews of people you know they asked me if my

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:46.140
marriage had been consummated because at that time you were too young probably

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:53.140
Asian you know the port Asian women into Indian women into and there were the

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.900
marriage wasn't country it was a marriage of convenience a lot was

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:01.220
happening then so this home office person asked me has your marriage been

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:07.060
consummated and Michael said what do you think and she said well we have to

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:12.740
ask if if are you prepared to be examined by a doctor oh yes are you

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:17.540
exam prepared to be examined by a doctor should we need to I said yeah why not go

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:27.200
ahead and they didn't but it was weird did you not feel offended yes what can

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:31.160
you do you know she's jumped the password and said welcome to Britain I

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:41.360
went really and I never felt at home in England I never did I never felt welcome

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:46.600
you know there was always this underlying something that I never felt I

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:53.320
didn't have a lot of friends in London you know and then of course I discovered

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:59.880
Wales but this is interesting that you said about never feeling at home in

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:04.520
England yeah despite presenting as British and having a lot of friends yes

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:12.720
I didn't have any smiley friends no all English so this is why I'm interested

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:17.600
why did you not feel at home because I don't know I just do something which is

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:24.160
making me feel not welcome yes they talked to me I was their mate there was

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:29.000
always this underlying you know something I can't put my finger in it

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.320
I've got this friend in London and she'll say to me no I went to see the

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:41.000
doctor today and he was black and you think so or he was brown I said so and

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.920
my cousin actually kicked her out of the house his house because he said she was

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:50.840
racist so he she's still good or the plumber came to the oh he was he was he

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:57.600
was black it's the way it was said yeah so I said so what do you think of me then

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:03.280
I'm brown how about you again you different and then you discovered Wales

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:09.360
yeah so I met some Welsh people when I was a whole year in Greece really nice

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:14.080
ladies older much older and they were really really loved the accent I loved

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:18.400
this thing songy accent and it was so funny and I said wait so you're doing

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.440
Wales she said don't tell me you're not mean I said no actually I haven't been

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:31.240
past sort of Oxford you know and she said oh Manchester and she said come

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:36.840
come to Wales she lived in Newport her friend lived in Kaleon and honestly

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:42.760
getting over this bridge which was then the seventh bridge I was like whoa this

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:47.520
is it this is me this is me I'm home even though of course I didn't know

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:52.560
anything about you know what was down there it was just something about I

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:58.440
don't know I can't express it it was the feeling of peace which I'd never known

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:05.440
in England so that's something that the Welsh landscape yes very much the light

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:10.200
something is that we go to France you see this light where they painted and

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:15.160
you think oh it was the same year I mean look at that the light and I thought

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:20.120
wow anyway that there was a long time ago but I used to visit I used to come

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.120
every month to Wales and they took me everywhere they brought me to the

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:27.800
valleys they brought me took me to Monmouthshire to Swansea remember Cardiff

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:34.040
Bay wasn't there wasn't there then it was a dump if you remember 30 years ago

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:43.040
35 years ago was when you first came to Wales then you were privileged enough to have experienced the real

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:48.640
Tiger Bay yes and that's something that's yes historically again you know I said to

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:54.080
my so this is your immigrant area and she said yeah but we don't go there it's

00:49:54.080 --> 00:50:03.240
dangerous I said okay fine no but I saw a lot of ways and really Cardiff is great it's a

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:07.640
city but I love the mountains I love the mountains every time they brought me up

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:12.360
to and then we came this way we went to Blennaf and I could easily live here oh

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:16.520
it's a tough life I said oh I could easily live here of course for work I'd

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:22.080
have to be in Cardiff or the city but anyway things changed and I didn't make

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:27.840
it because we went to America instead my sister lived in the Cayman Islands and I

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:33.560
went to live in the Cayman Islands for three months to be with her I said to my

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.760
husband I'm off I'm tired of London I'm going I'm going to the Cayman's okay

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:43.980
bye then see you oh if I went to live with him in Cayman Islands for three

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:50.440
months then came back she then got headhunted to Florida and to a big

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:56.540
pharmaceutical something or the other company and so we visited Florida I would

00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:02.420
go to Florida three or four times a year Michael wouldn't but I would and

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:09.580
eventually he said oh I want to live there so we decided to make a move after

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:16.300
my parents passed away we looked after my parents and again as a white man he

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:20.580
didn't know how to look after you know they don't have that relationship family

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:25.300
dynamic like we do because I said to him I said if you marry me you're marrying

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:29.540
my family you know that don't you because we'll be around and he said yeah

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:35.700
I don't mind and he really helped my parents both of them both of them were

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:45.100
very fond of Michael and he helped his mother as well he's got a good heart so yes so we went to

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:52.660
America for 2004 to 2011 had a business over there but the American Embassy

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:54.260
didn't like it so we were back.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:58.460
What was your experience like in America? Did you feel welcome? Did you enjoy California?

00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.460
Florida.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:00.460
Florida sorry.

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:10.540
Yes but the people were very strange you met the very mad part of Florida and you

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:16.100
had the very kind of Republican oh they were not very nice but they were all my

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.980
clients they were the rich ones I mean I'd get hundred dollar three hundred

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:23.340
dollar tips to do just a bit of work for them you know.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.340
What was your business?

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:29.660
It was it was doing well it was a wellness clinic natural means by

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:35.140
like therapy so if you had an injury or if you fell down or you were downside

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:39.620
lot of dancers a lot of runners would come in within three four treatments

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:44.220
they were back on because you know when you when you got a big injury you'd be

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.780
out for six seven months these weren't three months later though I mean they

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:52.620
It's very big in Canada in the US there's some places in London that do it

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:58.140
but it hasn't got on here because the pharmaceuticals won't let you they want

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:02.500
you to have the medicines why should you I had trouble with the pharmaceuticals

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:08.540
in America oh yeah yeah yeah and the and the medics because oh it doesn't work

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:12.740
that I said look at the look at the risk look at the research this has been going

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:17.980
on for ages they're now doing you know a little laser therapy where it's not so

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:24.300
not so invasive and you get well quickly rather than being cut it's the same thing

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:29.940
but this is cold laser that's hot laser I said we're going on for ages it's

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:36.140
proof it was a struggle it was a struggle out there and you said you had

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:42.260
the crazy part of yeah there were the the well I wouldn't say it because

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:45.820
people thought I was crazy as well okay so I'm putting myself in that category

00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:53.060
so the holistic people so although I was I was running a scientific thing to me

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:57.940
it was holistic and I had you know massage therapist doing things you know

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:02.780
diggily-diggily things and and it was a bit of a mixture because Florida

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:10.660
actually up north is very holistic lots of therapists yes some good some bad you

00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:16.940
know a lot of chakra readings and a lot of some things are very weird I must say

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:23.340
but you know I couldn't get my head around it but and I'm I think I'm quite

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:30.540
spiritual I I feel things I feel like I'm at you I suddenly sudden you walked

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:35.860
in the room I thought whoa I feel a connection here you know and a lot of

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:41.540
people I don't but yeah you were involved with some crazies I must say

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:48.140
and then my drum beating you know and drum and Michael Michael you're

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:53.140
completely crazy you've got me a nut job you know I said look it pleases me okay

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:59.300
it pleases me I believe I believe I'm I'm an open book I love everything the

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:04.740
strangest thing here in Wales was I went to there's a sacred shop there of

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:10.020
crystals and stuff and every Monday we used to go there and she was a palm

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:15.980
Easter tarot person of spiritual person and this one morning she had an Ouija

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:20.660
board now I've never seen one before heard of them they call it the spiritual

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:26.940
board okay so she said you put your finger on the thingy and it moves so she

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.980
said who are you very dear to I said my grandfather and she said all right ask

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:38.500
him if he's here and honestly that thing moved and said yes I said what is your

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:42.780
name and he spelled his name for me allowed him now I'm with a bunch of

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:48.780
white people yeah if it's a John Smith I'd question it but when he said allowed

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:55.500
in and I said when did you die and he said 6th of February 1962 at that point

00:55:55.500 --> 00:56:01.620
I let go I couldn't believe it so you found this kind of spiritual practice

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:06.940
out in Aberdeer in Wales that you've not experienced quite ever so it's quite

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:12.260
phenomenal yeah that this is tell me a bit about you landing in Wales then okay

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:16.900
so when we came back America obviously the American Embassy refused us the

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:23.460
business visa so we had to leave so we had to sell apartment I just sort out

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:29.820
the business can come back to Oxford and where Michael's from and we lived with

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:35.100
his mum for a bit because I didn't want to live with mum for a bit but anyway

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:40.060
she had to go into a nursing home and I said to Michael I think it's time now

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:47.060
it's time to move to Wales and my friend Debbie who had moved from London to

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:53.140
Wales and married a Welshman lived in Bridgend and she had a cottage in

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:57.860
Astrod and she said you know what you're doing in Oxford wasting time you know

00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:02.620
you want to come to Wales I'm offering you that cottage come try it for a year

00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:07.460
if you don't like it go back you know well you're well to oyster now you can

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:14.540
do what you want and I said okay so we came to this cottage and after she'd

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:21.620
done it up and I loved it I loved and you know her friend Hillary took us up

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:27.020
to the book not the rigors and we stood there and you're looking at all this

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:33.020
mountains and the Brecon's oh my god and every I still see this view and I can't

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:39.140
get over it I cannot I see it and I go oh I can't believe this how beautiful it

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:44.620
is despite your memories of East Africa and all the road trips yeah here in

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:48.980
Wales you're blown away yes landscape never mind the Serengeti and all the

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:55.180
lovely places we know this is it for me I'm gonna die here I mean honestly it is

00:57:55.180 --> 00:58:00.700
it and the and the beaches and the ocean you know and we go to St. David's

00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:06.060
to see our friends and we go to Ogmore where Debbie is and he's like I don't

00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:09.940
want to leave well you know you're just going over the bridge to England when he

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:15.880
says welcome to him I go that's that's how it happens and then you come back to

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:22.260
Wales this is crazy summary we back isn't that terrible it's delightful I

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:27.000
think oh my god and Michael looks at you completely mad I don't think I'm

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.220
gonna leave this little house yeah might end up somewhere else no I think

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:36.260
there's pressure to move to Manchester to be near the community I think for the

00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:42.940
Asians who live in Wales and my father is was one of them yeah had this ex the

00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:51.060
same experience yeah of this homecoming yeah this welcome yeah that you don't

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:56.280
experience anywhere else in person I feel exactly the same yeah whenever I

00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:03.260
come to from England yeah yeah I know my place is here is here yeah up to this

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:10.100
point so in it you've had such a journey and so many life experiences and these

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:13.620
ups and downs you know having a business not having a business taking care of

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:17.820
your family taking care of your in-laws having places to live not having places

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:22.980
to live not having money not having passports yeah displaced what does

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:31.140
resilience mean to you now am I am I as resilient as I as I was then I think

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:38.980
then now I feel I feel not so strong maybe I'm getting older I don't know but

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:44.140
then it was like a big adventure you know everything was an adventure I

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:48.580
treated it like an adventure I think I wouldn't have survived if I hadn't been

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:54.100
so resilient and I think it's thanks to my mom who just tell me go you you you

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:58.780
don't need to depend on anyone you need to go stand on your own two feet and I

00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:06.220
always remember that go and my sisters both of them too so this idea of being

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:11.420
a need to be independent very has been the thing that has given you has been

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:18.220
the source of your resilience yes yes never never never I'm saying never obey

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:22.940
I mean even with my dad when he went eventually when they came to live in

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:29.780
England because they live they left they left Kenya soon after to go to India but

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.980
they didn't like it because they couldn't assimilate with the Indians they

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:39.500
said they were they're really different I went but dad we're all Indians he said no

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:44.060
we're not you need to come and look but we didn't go never been to India but then

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:49.580
we decided that going live in Portugal and they loved Portugal so again I went

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.420
if the colonial thing you know that loved loved Portugal they lived in near

01:00:54.420 --> 01:01:00.820
near the sea Nestor real and there was a Jamaat Khan in Portugal they loved it

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:06.260
until they both got poorly and then came back came to you can't live yeah after

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:11.340
that was time and how easy was it for them to come from Portugal into the UK

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:17.900
very at that time they came as our dependence applied for dependency as long

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:24.580
as they did not ask the government for anything I said no we have a house we

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:31.700
have money we have resources now and so no they'll be totally reliant on on me

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:37.540
and my husband and we built us we built a further story on our house so they

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:42.780
could have their own bedroom bathroom we had our own space very together and and

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:46.580
we did everything else together they've got to they've got to mosque on Fridays

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:53.580
we didn't obviously and we had a dog not a mad dog like the one you've got now

01:01:53.580 --> 01:02:00.220
but smaller dog my mom was really fond of the dog yeah and then of course they

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:05.260
both got poorly and passed away so that actually goes against the stereotypes of

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:09.140
how people come to the UK and why they come to the UK and a lot of that is

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:15.460
about claim benefits yeah having free housing and so on but you supported your

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:20.320
parents and through their illnesses never ever I until now that I'm now

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:25.220
getting a pension I don't think it's a benefit I think it's my entitlement for

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:31.940
working 35 years in this country and paying tax never did my parents got

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:36.860
claim any benefit until my father was dying and the social workers said you

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:40.700
know you can get something called attendance allowance and he went what's

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.780
that then and I said but we're not allowed to I said I've signed a paper

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:51.620
with the home office still got it I went to dad okay you want to take it I said

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:56.900
if we get caught then I'll have to pay it back you know that when we died and

01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:01.620
all the money went back all right but he got he got benefits he didn't want them

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:07.420
I didn't want them because I'd signed a condition with the home office that he'd

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.940
never be dependent from the state and this was a recommendation from a white

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:18.100
social worker British social worker so they were getting something attendance

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:26.860
I can't remember attendance allowance keep it because I might have to give it

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:31.740
back because this is not right and then they were asked for it I give it to

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:42.940
charity give it all to Marie Curie yeah and just before we kind of wrap things

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:48.900
up I'm curious would you you said that you've never been to India would I ever

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:55.140
go you mean and would you ever go back to East Africa I think it would hurt too

01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:01.420
much I think I took Michael when we married I wanted him to see but only to

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:05.260
Kenya but things were different I said this this is what I really but they do

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:11.900
we did the right thing you know Safari and all that and all that but I left that

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:18.700
I got on the plane and I was so upset I thought I can't come back I don't know

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:23.620
if I can go back it would be too hurtful my cousins go all the time even my

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:28.340
cousins have just come back from Monza and they show me it's now a city of 1

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:34.060
million people and it hurts to see it like that you know I think oh my god

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:40.380
those happy days by the lake watching the crocodiles and watching the hippo

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:46.540
local hippo come and and now it's nothing there so gone one a city of 1

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.220
million people when it used to be about 10,000 and it was very close to nature

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:56.340
yes because you could hear at night this is what I'll never forget it's the

01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:01.720
sounds of the drums you see you lying there and you hear a lion roar and you

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:08.500
hear a leopard roar and then you hear the of the drums and I was with the drums

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:15.100
of Africa and I thought that sound will never leave me until I die so in a way I

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:22.220
think do I say I'm an African or I'm British I just say I'm a universal

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:30.780
citizen because Africa means the world to me it really does but we had to leave

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:43.540
and it's sad you okay thank you very much okay thank you very much it's okay

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:48.260
it's beautiful I haven't said anything stupid all right
