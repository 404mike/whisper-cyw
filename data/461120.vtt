The commentary was almost unnecessary because you had the visual thing in front of you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Again, going back, and it's certainly not drawn comparisons, but it's like watching a match.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If for some reason the sound goes, you've still got the images.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now similarly, you are seeing the kind of pain etched on people's faces.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I suppose the commentary was something that was there, but at the same time it wouldn't have mattered a great deal if it were not.
