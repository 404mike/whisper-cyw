Okay, it's the 26th of August 2019 and we're here at Ellen Valley Show and we're talking to...

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.520
Martin Atwood.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.560
Martin. Have you been coming here very often?

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.160
Yes, for about the last 20 odd years I would say, yes.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.040
And why do you keep coming back?

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.560
We just love the area, beautiful scenery, interested in the construction of all the dams.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.360
It always fascinates me and it's just a beautiful area and the wildlife.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.880
Redcoats are amazing, I love to see the redcoats.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.920
Yeah, it's just our first destination of any holiday season so we've bought a static caravan down it.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.880
Good.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.080
Down, down, down, and the best thing we've ever done.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.600
Absolutely love it here.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360
Thank you very much for that.
