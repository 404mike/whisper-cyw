00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.760
in September of 1981 as a staff nurse and worked on one of the villas there for six months.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.760
And then I was promoted to the charge nurse position on another villa, which was,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.080
just carrying on that, which was very interesting because it was

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:34.400
in the way in which the area was organized it was probably seen as a very difficult

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.280
villa and no one was expected to stay there for very long in charge. It was where you were young

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.200
green people were put because of its difficulties and you weren't supposed to like it but you sort

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.400
of did your six months there and then you moved to somewhere that was a bit nicer you know it was

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:04.400
that sort of thing. Like everywhere it was understaffed but it was a very male dominated

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.640
staff group and I could see straight away that that wasn't particularly good. There was

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.440
there was a sort of a bit of a lads attitude amongst the staff

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:30.080
and there was only one female there and I felt that we certainly needed more definitely.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.320
I think not necessarily I mean I wasn't privy to any in those days I wasn't privy to any

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.520
reasons why people should be moved or put in different places but I knew sometimes it was

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:58.880
used as a punishment ward in the hospital managers at the time if someone was you know this was long

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:09.520
before staff had appraisals and things like that. If you were seen as a bad member of staff

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.320
you would get moved to this particular area. In the few years I was there and I was there from 1981

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:34.240
until the end of 1986 the villa was transformed I think to from the back ward to the best one

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.480
and people wanted to come and work there because they saw that the attitudes amongst the staff

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.920
were positive they were different. I mean Lin was one who came as a youngster 18

00:02:51.120 --> 00:03:01.040
and I think you know we got the staff to work as a team there was a better approach obviously

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.440
but I think how did you know in yeah I think I think we allowed sort of

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.440
how did the residents react I think we allowed sort of personal relationships

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.520
improve really you know I think the staff actually noticed the likes and dislikes of particular

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.000
individuals which was which was amazing you know it was something that I think a lot of people

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.400
hadn't considered before and for example I had I think about activities one member of staff

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:44.880
who liked walking and I said well you know we've got some young active men here I think it was it

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:57.040
really in my view and the you know memory fades a bit but it was that the Walsh office taking away

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.720
the prospect of the simple as that the prospect of um resettlement we realized that we had

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.720
quite a few years left in the hospital and we wanted to do something positive you know rather

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.200
than just tread water and that was that was the worst possible you know that's what I said about

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:23.760
this you know you can't tread water these are people with there you know and so we again Dave

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.360
and one or two others were absolutely fantastic prime movers in this there were some really really

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.680
good staff there who were you know we looked at everything in depth you know why do we do this what

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.400
why why why do we you know what what is wrong with our practice you know and these were people

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.440
by and large who had very good practice for the times you know what I mean you know but they were

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.360
looking at all these sort of things and so the staff the staff meetings that we had um in those

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.080
days where um anyone could come along were unbelievable in terms of the the ideas and the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.280
the thoughts that were coming out it was a very positive movement very positive and Dave and Pete

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.520
and Isabel and one or two others were prime movers in encouraging that and out of that not only came

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:25.040
a sort of um uh an improvement in um ways in which we could encourage choices and opportunities

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.440
but for the residents but also I think for the staff as well you know with better training and

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:40.080
better understanding really of what we were about and you know and sharing of experiences and

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.520
everything that perhaps the institution didn't have before was was seen as something that we could

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.760
now do unfettered in a way I mean it sounds ridiculous to say again it's me taking the

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.600
moral low ground unfettered by this resettlement nonsense of junk you know just I mean you know it

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.560
was um but meanwhile obviously we were still I in particular I was still planning for that you know

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.520
and um and I think there was a sort of there was a the gulf between the sort of the members of staff

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.680
and the and the parents was was actually quite wide and I think it was quite important to sort

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:27.040
of try to bridge that and um perhaps one of the ways in which we could do that was that we we made

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:36.720
quite a change as well on the in the in the way that the residents appeared by having proper clothes

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.480
I mean you've probably heard about the hospital issue clothes yeah which standard issue which

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:49.120
were pretty crap what they were wearing those hostiles you closed when you started yeah yeah

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.400
um and there wasn't uh and the perennial problem of course was underwear you know

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.920
underwear underwear underwear all the time you know there was there was never enough and um

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:10.320
underwear shade between the patients um each when I first went to this place I then I'm

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:18.000
memory faulty but I think people had individual underwear but there's never enough you know

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:27.440
and um this is just leading me onto all sorts of stuff now and so one one of the things I tried to

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.480
I tried to do is I'll come back to the parents in a minute was to encourage the staff who were

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:42.000
responsible for their small group to actually buy proper clothes you know take the client person

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.520
resident out shopping and buy some age-appropriate clothes and get some bloody underwear as well

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:56.480
you know while you're at it lots of it and I remember sess this this chat took uh took um

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:03.360
two people started to you know slow walks out on the hills and they loved it and it eventually

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.560
became something that was part of their week and you know would make sure that sess had perhaps a

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.320
day where he would take one particular gentleman who was really was um quite challenging at times

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:21.440
and he would spend six seven hours walking on the hills and he would come back in the evening

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.120
and he would be tired but happily tired you could see it you know you could see that he would

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:35.280
whereas before in in the evenings he would perhaps be um very energetic and perhaps and spent a lot

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:42.000
of his time pinching and biting and anything that he could uh that was going past him he would perhaps

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.800
just sat down in the chair and I would just think well yeah it's nice you know in the same way as I

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.280
would be reflecting on perhaps that I had an interesting day and I'm feeling a bit knackered

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:59.600
now and um yeah so it was things like that I think that um generally started to make make people

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:10.240
realize that there was perhaps a bit more to a bit more to um the work the job and and I remember

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:16.720
sess this this um chat took uh the bathrooms had two baths in them

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:25.040
and so it was natural that two people would be bathed at the same time you know why on earth

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.560
I mean speed was the essence of this sort of thing you had to get things done you know the

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:37.040
quick you got things done I challenged one person once and she said oh um you know because baths

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:44.960
were done in the evening and it was she would say this was the um sole female oh we finished

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.520
by quarter past seven and so I said what do you mean you finished you finished at nine thirty

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.760
knowing what she meant she said well we finished we'd done everything I said so what did you do

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:03.280
for the next two and quarter hours then well we she couldn't couldn't say what you know and it

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:09.280
was that sort of attitude that I was really trying to change because you didn't finish you

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:15.440
know you were your responsibilities were there for the people there right until you went home so

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:25.040
again I um said right okay bathroom privacy you know one person has a bath at a time

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.240
didn't go down too well um but that would mean we'll get everything done

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.200
a bit slower I said well yeah but I mean it doesn't mean to say you have to stay

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.800
later after your shift I'm I'm tracing this obviously you know after your shift finishes

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.480
but yeah it will be but that's the way it's going you know it needs to be done and I have to say I

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:52.240
um I try to encourage people to do that and I used to do it myself obviously so it was a

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.160
I believe very much in leading by example and those sort of things you know um quite a number

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.320
of the young men who lived there had parental visits which is quite surprising really and they'd

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:13.680
been in hospital for most of their lives yet um there was a still um yeah you know it was great

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:22.800
actually it was wonderful um no no um no it tended to be weekends but there was the hospital was

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.960
this wasn't me this was the hospital sort of encouraged visitors to be honest I don't think

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:36.160
there was any um any restrictions on on when people could come it was generally down to the way that

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.360
the the villa used to manage those sort of things and what was convenient for

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.760
the parents or the visitors um in fact I remember we had one young man who

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:55.120
um used to go home every other week actually which was you know it was a must have been such

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:01.440
a trial for his parents because my goodness he was not easy um quite a number of the young men who

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:08.240
lived there had parental visits which is quite surprising really um they'd been in hospital for

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:17.040
most of their lives yet um there was a still um yeah you know it was great actually it was wonderful

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.600
Did you fall out of the hospital by accident?

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.500
I hadn't been towards anyone

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.920
I could have productive died

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.160
it kind of made me feel a little bit worse

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:36.320
um I feel a little, Iお chassis

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.960
used to lead up to death

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.160
that was the first impression

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.520
and what was convenient for the parents or the visitors.
