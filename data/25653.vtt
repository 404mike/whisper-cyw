00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920
Track 2, Voil Vadyan Trigpoint. There can be all sorts of colours. Two audio stops,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.080
two very impressive views, don't you think? You are now standing 564 metres above sea

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:27.520
level, 1850 feet in old money. Until your right, north, you can see across the Davi

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.680
Valley to Cadrydris and other Snowdonia peaks as before from the memorial, and now the view

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.920
is almost 360 degrees. And ahead, slightly to your left, at the south west, you can now

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.920
see the long humped whale back of Pymlemann, meaning five peaks in Welsh, and the rail

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.640
focal point in the north Cambrian's landscape. Below can be seen Glyndwr's Way, which snakes

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.800
its way towards the almost lifeless Glaslyne Lake that we will learn about at stop four.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.840
Throughout the year, the patchwork of hues you can see from this vantage point is always changing,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.920
as Emir Lewis, a local farmer for over 30 years, recalls. Well, I think it's just the different

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.440
colours that you have looking from there. You're looking down at the Davi Valley, and the colours,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.000
all the greenery and the different pieces that have been ploughed and reseeded over the years,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.920
it's a different green to where the old pastures are. And then you look across to the hills,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.960
and they can be all sorts of colours, depending on the weather conditions.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.880
The Davi Valley is not just a pretty place to look at. It is one of only a handful of biosphere

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.400
reserves in the UK, an international conservation designation created to promote and demonstrate a

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.000
balanced relationship between humans and the biosphere. From the Cessail Oak woodlands in the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.480
valley tops to the estuary below, the area is rich in wildlife. And as Clive Faulkner,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.600
Conservation Manager for the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, explains,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.840
for a major estuary it is curiously underdeveloped. Unusually, there aren't actually buildings. There

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.080
isn't a marina, there isn't a factory, there isn't a town. Most, if you look at most of the valleys,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.880
most of the estuaries in the UK, they end in a town, they end in an oil refinery, they end in

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.800
a marina. And it's not the case there. So actually, if you look at the whole valley as a unit,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.440
it's a beautiful, unique place. And it's basically unspoiled. And yet there are people there who are

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.480
living with the landscape. And that's a really special thing. Retrace your steps back to the new

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.280
style. But do not cross it. Instead turn right and head downhill. When the slope eases, bear right

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.120
towards the left hand side of Glaslin Lake, rather than following the fence line. And your route down

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.240
and across open moorland to join Glyndua's Way will become clear. Upon reaching the National Trail,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.280
turn left and listen to track three, when this path crosses the track for vehicles.
