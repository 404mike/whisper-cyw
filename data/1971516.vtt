00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
Regarding wildlife, and this is what's really, really interesting, quite a few years back,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.840
this is when the marina was still there and there were two black gillimots that were in

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.840
the marina.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.840
You'd see them quite a lot.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.920
Black gillimots are quite distinct, little tiny little black and white birds with little

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.920
orange feet.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.280
So really quite distinct.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.960
And every day you'd see one black gillimot or two black gillimots.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.520
It became normal, just normal.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.960
And then one time I happened to be up in the light at the RSPB, the old RSPB centre, and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.280
I was talking to them about the black gillimots in the holly head.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.960
And they were like, there are no black gillimots in the holly head.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.400
We're quite far south, we'll get black gillimots.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.880
And they were like, there are no black gillimots.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.880
Yes, there are two.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.880
No, no, no, there aren't.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880
Yes, yes, yes, there are two.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880
No, no, no.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.640
Anyway, okay, not a problem, but if you get down at any point to have a look at the marina,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.320
chances are you'll probably see a black gillimot.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.600
I don't know if this is following on from that or it was just something else insignificant,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.600
I don't know.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.800
But then, what's the long afterwards, you'll see somebody with a big kind of herobinocleus

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.800
or something looking out.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.320
But yes, a little things like the black gillimots.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.760
It is quite key, like the terns.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.560
This year, there's about a thousand extra terns that are at the Scaries, the islands

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.560
just north of holly head.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.040
And it's the most southerly population of nesting terns.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.080
I think it's a really unique place.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.440
For a port that people think of as noise and pollution and horribleness, it's not.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.760
It's raw and it's beautiful.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.240
Everything is managed really, really well.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.120
And we've got some fantastic, fantastic things happening out there.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.280
And there are more gannets.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.120
And at one point, I thought maybe, and then there are people thinking maybe there was

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.880
a gannet tree starting on Middlemouse, one of those islands on the East Coast.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.200
So I think wildlife is really key in that port town.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.520
Again, if you just crossed from Ireland or crossing from a holly head, you'd never think

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.040
what a little gem, what a little hidden treasure, what a jewel it was.
