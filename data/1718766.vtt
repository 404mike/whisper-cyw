In the time that I've been here there are more houses in the village. The village was smaller then

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:17.520
and it was more attractive in some ways. You have much more of the feeling of the estate village

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.680
which, where we all three of us live, is a manifestation of the estate

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.760
one way or another and the houses in the centre, the very centre of the village, the Indian

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.480
cross-pottage, down to home farm are all part of that entity. It's interesting if you look at the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.960
historic environment, virtually everything in the centre of the village, including the petrol pump

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:59.120
phone box are listed buildings. The Abbey is obviously a scheduled area in Cadbury.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.240
Also we were talking about changes in the village and that was one of the, was a big change when we

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.400
suddenly find that we were going down the Abbey Road and we met a large coach coming up

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.920
full of tourists. But it was a new dimension and you find them around the village, they go into

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.600
the church, they go into the church, they put some money in the box which is always quite useful,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.160
and put money in the box for the pamphlets, the Abbey Trust as well,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.200
and yes, there's something else, I must give you the information...
