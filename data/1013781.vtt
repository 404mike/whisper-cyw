00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
And for the bass, lull the

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:14.500
southeast wind, and let not

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.240
the wind blow herus to drone

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.700
meath .

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:08.920
how I miss Thite good light with freshman.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.420
. . .

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:23.420
How I miss Thite good light with freshman.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:40.760
The opening all angels, open all their repels.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.780
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet crown.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.580
The stars in the bright sky look down where we lay,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:05.980
The little Lord Jesus, lasting on the hill.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:14.180
O, guide the life of me, thou give me no praise,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.380
Thou give the Lord Jesus no pride in me praise.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.580
I love thee, O Jesus, look down from the sky,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:40.580
And take my right hand till morning is nigh.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.980
O, when I no rest yet, and ready I feel,

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.580
For where I no power, no bread to ravish,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:05.980
O, sever the red wine, the red wine of life,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:17.380
By mercy not from earth, but from sweet love mine.
