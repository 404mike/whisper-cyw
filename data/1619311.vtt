00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700
So there was one thing that happened when I was president, yes, hit the newspapers,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.600
well hit the Jewish Chronicle, is when I first started there was still a bit of

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.000
antagonism between some people of the Orthodox and some people of the Reform.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.660
And when I started there was a Bar Mitzvah coming up where the mother was a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.740
member of the Orthodox, the father was a member of the Orthodox and the Reform,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.620
but the father's family were members of the Reform. And as I told you, you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.180
read the law on the Saturday and you give segments to various members of the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.620
thing. And the father, they're quite wealthy people, they've always got their own way.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.740
And the father told me that there's two things he wants. He wants his father to

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.740
be called up to read the law as the most important one. And also they're having a

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.300
function in the City Hall but they don't want it to be supervised because if it's

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.420
supervised, the person supervising might tell someone what a surprise the meal is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.780
going to be. I thought, God, yeah, I've got to put up with all this. So I said, look, as far as I'm

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.500
aware, you've got to have it supervised but we'll try and be flexible because

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.700
also they're having, the City Hall hasn't got kosher kitchen, so all the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.420
ovens in the City Hall have to be sort of koshered, cleaned, and they're having

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.100
special pots and pans, good. I said, but then it's got to be supervised so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.220
everything is okay because you've got so many people coming, you know, from various

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.940
strands of the religion. I said, you know, I've got a problem in that at the moment

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.420
it's changed because of this. At the moment the Constitution of the Cardiff

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.180
United Synagogue says that if you're a member of the Reform Trial, you can't be

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.140
called up. So which is a terrible thing for the grandfather but we had people

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.100
around me who said this is how it is. He was a member, this is the point, he was a

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.380
member of the Orthodox and he left and became a member of the Reform and he knew

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.980
that when he became a member of the Reform he could never be called up in

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.620
the thing. So in the end we had a rabbi visiting that week and the person who

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.340
ran the services who was very right-wing said the rabbi can't make a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.900
presentation, they always present the boy with, called a humish, which is a book of

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.340
Bible in Jewish and Hebrew and he said we're not presenting the boy with a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.700
humish and we're not going to have a sermon. So I said but it's not the boy's

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.740
fault, it's the boy's big day, what do you want to do in the boy's day over this? I

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.060
said he's got to. So they said no, as far as we're concerned, no. So I went to see them

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.620
and I said look we've got to do something about this. So I said I'll tell you what I

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.340
can do and I said I'll arrange for the supervision of the food and everything to

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.940
be done and our kosher, the arrangement for the everything to be kosher, some

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.460
rituals, so you needn't worry, done. Someone will go in at six o'clock in the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.660
morning, the man suing the supervision will go in at six o'clock in the morning,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.620
they'll clean the ovens, the man who's supervising the food will leave at nine

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.820
o'clock. So if you want to do anything extra after nine it won't be supervised

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.140
but we'll accept it. And I said as far as your father's concerned he can't be

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.980
called up to read the law but I'll arrange for him to be called up to have

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:58.580
some other honour, lesser honour. And they said fine, okay. So then the day before

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.500
this permits Friday night doing surgery I get a phone call, you've got to

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.020
come here straight away. I said I can't go, I'm in the middle of surgery. No you've got

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.780
to come straight away. I said what's happened? The family said they don't want

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.700
the father to have the special honour, they want him to read the law and

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.140
therefore the senior warden says if that's the case I'm not going in to at

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.140
six o'clock in the morning and to do all this. So I thought hell. So what happened

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:38.420
in the end is I did the presentation, I gave the sermon in the synagogue and

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.540
the family, and also I praised the grandfather, how wonderful it's to see him

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.260
fit and well and he survived the Holocaust and we're pleased to see him etc etc.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.060
And the family came up and thanked me, said thank you very much, you've made

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.260
the day, you know it's been a wonderful day and everyone was happy. Six months

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:05.540
later, six months later, headlines in the Jewish Chronicle, Shul prevents

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.300
grandfather from being called up for his grandson's permits for and the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.220
grandfather had given this whole story to the Jewish Chronicle. Now A, it was

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.940
wrong, so I wrote it, but B, the Jewish Chronicle have writers who are

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.180
syndicated all over the world, so two of the people who have actually

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.900
attacked me personally over this as if I was the one to blather, I was trying to

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.540
smooth things over and what happened was when my son went to Australia

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.500
and he got called up in the synagogue and they said, what's your name?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.940
He said, where you from Carl? He said, you're no relation to that man who refused to

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.060
let the grandfather, and he said, yes, he said, well we feel like shucking you off.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.660
So that was quite dramatic, that was goes down in the history, but

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.580
that's changed now, they had to change it because there's so few men and so

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:13.140
you know through actual what's going on they had to change the Constitution.
