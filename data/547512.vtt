00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For dinner we had turkey and blazing pudding.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And after dinner the uncles sat in front of the fire, loosened all their buttons,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
put their large moist hands over their watch chains, groaned a little and snapped.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Mothers, aunts and sisters scuttled to and fro, bearing two rings.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Aunty Bessie, who had already been frightened twice by a clockwork loves,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
wimpered at the side door and had some elderberry wine.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The dog was sick. Aunty Dozie had to have three aspirins.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But Aunty Hannah, who liked port, stood in the middle of the snowbound backyard, singing like a big bosom thrush.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I would blow up the balloons to see how quickly they would blow up to.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And when they burst, which they all did, the uncles jumped and rumbled and went back to sleep.
