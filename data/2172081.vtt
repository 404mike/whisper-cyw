00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
Raki or Ratchi I must have led a sheltered life as I have

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.960
not heard of or encountered Raki or in local village speak Ratchi until we first came to

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.200
the island. It's a clear, strong spirit manufactured from grape pressings or so I've been told

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.000
and it appears that licensing regulations are more relaxed than it's made as a sort

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.840
of home brew. It's traditional for a small flask and glasses to be brought to your table

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.640
at the end of a meal, sometimes with a complimentary sweet course. I'm pleased if it's a plate

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.640
of fresh fruit as grapes, apple slices or melon pieces dipped in the spirit is my preferred

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.880
way to consume it. There are other traditions that seem to be associated with it. Men will

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.520
often throw it down like a shot and then slam the empty glass on the table where it's refilled.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.840
We also suffered one evening in one of the family restaurants where after already relaxing

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.160
from a hearty meal with plentiful wine we were brought a small flask and drank it slowly

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.920
while listening to the owner's son playing me traditional music on a liner. When the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.320
performance had finished we clapped to Ioko enthusiastically as it was clear that he had

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.680
musical skills. He came over to our table with another flask and explained this as from

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.000
his father, the owner of the restaurant. He pointed at a bearded gentleman closer to

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.800
our age sitting in the corner and we both raised glasses to one another. We drank two

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.540
small glasses each of the strong spirit emptying the flask but to our alarm Ioko brought another

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.440
full flask. We didn't know whether to refuse as bad etiquette so we compromised by ordering

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.320
a flask for Ioko and his father and drank just half of our flask before insisting on

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.040
getting the bill and paying it while I could still see and stand up. In future I vowed

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.400
to always leave a little in the flask to demonstrate clearly that we'd finished for the night.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.360
On other occasions, particularly if it's a lunchtime meal, on leaving you may be handed

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.800
a small recycled water bottle with a hushed description, this is my raki, the best. I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.160
carry a recurrent dread of leaving one of these in the hire car like a lurking unexploded

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.120
bomb, either waiting to spontaneously combust in the heat or almost as bad being mistaken

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.120
for a refreshing drink of water, a large swig of which would probably immediately exceed

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.280
the breathalyzer allowance. Thankfully neither of these have yet occurred, though I do speculate

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.440
how debilitating a new arrival at night at the airport would find their first drive on

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.520
the always exciting Cretan National Road if it was unwittingly enlivened by a hearty swig

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.000
from a forgotten raki bottle found in the hire car.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.400
The discovery of the raki industry on the island cleared up another mystery when we

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.080
spotted what looked like Anthony Gormley's foray into recreating the Clangers. Fans

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.520
of 1970s TV will recognise the likeness. They looked ancient and apparently they were distillation

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.560
vessels for creating the spirit, but I quite like them as a sort of metallic homage to

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.080
the Clangers. The abundance of the free raki bottles and the occasional house warming gift

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.360
of a bottle, again the promise this is my own or my uncle's, my brother's, father's

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.600
raki, the best, meant some kind of plan of action was required. We'd heard it was recommended

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.720
for aching joints and muscles, but currently not suffering from those problems and also

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.800
not wanting to go about in the daytime smelling of spirits for obvious reasons. The smell

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.240
in a hot car could also be dangerous. A cafe owner in the town recommended soaking fruit

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.560
in a bottle with a little sugar and turning it daily for a couple of weeks before straining

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.520
off the fruit. This process seems similar to making slow gin, so it certainly sounded

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.080
an option and we may end up with a more palatable drink. We experimented with lemon, strawberries

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.360
and cherries, but balked at the suggestion of coffee to provide a Cretan Tia Maria drink.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.360
It was a success and proved to be a welcome gift in small bottles to give to friends,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.000
so the surplus problem was solved.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.480
Archaeology For some visitors to Crete, the wealth of

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.960
archaeological sites on the island is a major attraction. I'd always been impressed by

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.800
the abundance of the sites, but also by their similarity to modern day hill villages. This

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.000
is not true with the royal palaces like Knossos and Malia, both of which we've visited and

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.960
vowed to return at a quieter time to try and avoid the crowds.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.520
The sites that I found more interesting were the Minoan towns like Gurnia to the south

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.600
of us, set in an idyllic position near the coast and covering a relatively large area

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.680
of hillside, sloping down towards the sea. Walking around the site, the width of the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.280
streets and the footprints of the small houses and the rooms within were so close in scale

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.160
that they were a bit of a different layout to our own and many other traditional villages on the island.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.000
We can imagine our own village would look very similar if all the houses were demolished

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.640
to leave the walls only one metre high, and the remaining walls in this ancient town appeared

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.880
of very similar construction to what we have seen of our own stone walls during the renovation

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.880
process.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.720
Archaeologists have dated the settlements back to 3000 years BC, but have since concluded

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.840
that part of the original town was levelled around 1700 BC for the construction of a small

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.840
palace. At its most populous, the town was estimated to have a population of some 4000,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.320
but excavations suggest the palace was destroyed by fire around 1450 BC, at a time when every

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.760
major Minoan centre was destroyed or abandoned.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.440
The town was excavated in the early 20th century and is one of the Minoan settlements to be

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.000
fully excavated. The town lies on a small hill a few hundred metres from the coast and

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.880
in the Gulf of Marabella. The location is an important one, lying on the logical east-west

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.200
route across the island, but also near the north-south route at the narrowest point of

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.600
the island. The routes avoid the mountain heights, allowing easier communications. The

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.080
town was thought to extend down towards the seashore, and evidence of seashore installations

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.120
with excavations by archaeologists, naming a shore house, thought to be a ship shed,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.280
used as a long and narrow form of boat house. It was a large building, estimated at least

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:55.280
25 by 10 metres, incorporating storage rooms as well as ship stores. There are also remains

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.240
of a pier-type promontory foundations, both above water level and extending below the

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.200
water. These are fascinating remains and the Guernier site is heartily recommended for

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.720
a visit, but for us the most interesting detail is in the writings about the site and the

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.040
reference to Minoan houses. A quote from this, An idea of what Minoan houses looked

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.200
like can be gained from the ivory plaques discovered in the east wing of Knossos. These

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:31.880
plaques show what houses in the town of Knossos looked like in the seventeenth century B.C.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.280
On the roof there was a small room. This may have been used for sleeping in during the

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.600
hot summer months. The rooms on the first floor had windows, but those on the ground

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.840
floor did not, although some of them had doors on the ground floor. It may be that

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.440
the windows on the ground floor were avoided for simple reasons of security. The houses

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.960
were built around a wooden frame, wooden beams running horizontally and were linked to upright

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.560
beams. The most likely reason for the use of these beams was as protection against earthquake

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.840
damage. I was astounded reading this, as the description so closely matched our own house

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.560
before the renovation. The ground floor lacked a window, these on the first floor, and the

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.520
constructions were reinforced with timbers. As part of the rebuilding works, these were

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.520
replaced with steel frame construction as earthquake protection. There was also mention

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:33.160
of access between the floors by wooden ladders through a trap door inside the house. Shown

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.720
below is the hatch and ladder staircase when we first saw the house. One thing that has

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.680
always fascinated me about the island was the abundance of stones. Where in Britain

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.640
fields should be subdivided by hedgerows, here there were miles and miles of dry stone

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.160
walls. The stones were often used for elaborate terracing following the steep contours of

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.720
the mountains, but the surprising thing was that the fields and landscapes were still

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.920
covered in large stones. The rural depopulation and abandonment was not enough to explain

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.280
the quantity. It seemed as if despite all the traditional houses, the original paved

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.360
tracks and the boundary walls using these stones, there was still just too many to allow

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.680
the clearance of the land. To me it was a mystery.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.200
Tree in Daphilos One of my favourite restaurants in our early

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.480
stays was in the next village where you ate out of doors under the stars with a menu that

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.120
was all mezzas and predominantly vegetable dishes. They were always delicious and reasonably

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.840
priced and accompanied by metal flasks of the local house wine, nicely chilled. One

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.960
of the best things about the place was the waiter who was always welcoming but with a

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:51.000
very dry sense of humour. When it wasn't busy we would pester him with questions, most

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.960
of which he would answer with a shrug and a, I don't know, why do you want to know

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:01.960
that? He mostly reserved factual replies for questions about the food or recipes and

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:07.040
in these areas he was helpful. I recall that he was one of the first people to tell us

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.320
the name of the place across the large bay that we had discovered was Thripty but when

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:18.280
asked what it would be like he retorted, cold I should think, like this wine. One surprise

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:23.400
was when we asked his name and although he warned us it was unusual, we were amazed to

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:30.400
be told it was Triandaphalos which translates as rose or literally thirty petals. We were

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.880
disappointed one year to find the restaurant all closed up or the furniture was neatly

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:41.760
stacked on the terrace part which was covered with a rustic sort of wooden veranda. On later

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.560
visits we discovered that it had reopened but the new proprietor lamented that trade

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.560
was very slow as people seemed to have forgotten about it and in truth it was a little way

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:57.360
out of town, an upper hill that might deter casual visits. Anyway we stayed and had a

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:04.360
meal that was as good as it had always been, fava, several different bean dishes, courgette

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:11.360
balls, grilled aubergines, spicy cheese dips, meatballs and peppers accompanied by home-baked

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.360
bread and local wine. When we finished the owner shared a flask of raggi with us and

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.560
on here in our house was in the upper village, offered us a lift home which was tempting

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.560
but we politely refused saying that the walk up would help us sleep but we promised a return.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.360
The food was so good that we returned the following week bringing two friends who had

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.120
a shop in the resort. They enjoyed the meal but again we were the only diners. It was

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:44.400
in the early days of social media and I suggested they try to promote the business on TripAdvisor

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.840
which I wasn't sure that he saw the point of and our friends also promised to promote

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:54.200
the business to customers of their shop in the town. I thought no more about it but I

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.440
was pleased to see the following spring that as we walked past one evening the restaurant

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:04.360
seemed full, so full that we walked by suggesting we went on to somewhere quieter but the owner

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:10.440
had other plans calling out to us, hey Jeff come in I want to thank you so much. After

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.440
your visit last year your friends kept sending us new customers and we have a good TripAdvisor

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.640
score and things are going so well. I want to thank you for your help you must eat here

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.840
on the house. We were ushered in and treated like honoured guests. We had to go into the

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.440
kitchen where his wife who was the chef would also thank us and a space was cleared out

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:37.080
front for a table for us and we had a lovely meal for free. Maybe what goes around comes

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:45.680
around as they say. Wine. Crete has vineyards and produces some very good wine that is

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.440
rarely seen in Britain. We'd seen vineyards on some of the plateaus and had noticed the

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:57.320
vines tended to be low growing and wired differently to farming methods noticed in Italy or Spain.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.280
Our reaching out is frequent enough that we control our budget by sticking to the local

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:07.720
wines served in half or one kilo metal jugs and this white wine is usually served chilled

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:13.280
and tends to be light and refreshing. When a new taverna opened in our village our first

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.760
meal there was accompanied by the local wine and as sometimes happens a free drink is provided

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.560
at the end of the meal. As we paid our bill a large jug of wine was brought to our table.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.760
Not wishing to offend we explained we'd only arrived that afternoon and had some unpacking

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:34.160
and sorting out to do at the house. Where is your house? I pointed out through the side

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.320
window and said it's just at the back there. We're neighbours. Oh well take the jug home

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.920
with you it will help you with your unpacking. You can bring it back tomorrow. If we're not

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.520
open just leave it at the door. On returning the jug the next day to make conversation

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.300
I said how much we'd enjoyed the meal and the wine. The wine can be bought in town.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.220
You can keep the box in your fridge much cheaper than buying bottles. Always having

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.140
an eye for a bargain and knowing that jugs in the taverna were priced at only three or

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:09.140
six euros I enquired where I would find the boxes for sale. Do you know Andreas at the

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:14.380
bottom of the hill going into town? Isn't that the butcher's I asked curiously? Yes

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:20.140
he's my friend. Tell him Yanni sent you. He will give you my price if you're lucky.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:24.940
So later that week I was parking nearby and entering the first butcher's shop I tried

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:32.300
to buy drinks in. Hello we had your wine at Yanni's Taverna. He said I could buy it here.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:39.140
Of course white or red my friend? White please the same as Yanni has. 25 litres is that your

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:44.780
car nearby it's quite heavy. I roughly calculated this would be over five gallons and would

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:50.100
weigh around 50 pounds but also would completely fill the fridge and outlast our three week

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:56.180
stay by some margin. That's probably more than I want. Is that the only size you have?

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:05.900
Oh no 20 litres or 15. Anything smaller I asked tentatively? 10 litres then almost dismissively.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.820
We also have the smaller five litres. I think that would probably suit us to start with

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:18.980
and one was produced from behind the counter. Nine euros pardon? Nine of course I thanked him

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:24.380
paid and stacked out to the butchers with the smallest wine box he had for sale and the largest

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:30.100
one I'd ever bought while wondering how much the price per litre fairly have bought in bulk say

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:37.460
25 litres bulk also working out the profit margin in Tavernas on their wine jug sales. Still I repeat

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.420
I love a bargain.
