00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
And I remember the change after the armchairs,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.700
when mealtimes began to be much more somber,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.020
because to begin with they tried not to discuss what was going on in front of the children, as you do.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.640
But as time went on it got so bad that I remember the laughing and the jokes stopping,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.160
and the discussions were all about playmates and visas and people who'd been able to get out and those who haven't.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.280
And of course things changed dramatically at school because

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.440
after the armchairs

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.240
suddenly those of us in the class who were Jewish were kept separate from the others.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.760
You sit over there, you're Jewish, nobody has to talk to you.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.960
And I remember many of the girls joining the BDM, the Bundlerge MÃ¤dchen, which was like the Hitler Youth for girls.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.680
And I remember what they wore,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.640
including the three-quarter length white socks. And I have to say to this day,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.640
I have a dislike for three-quarter length white socks,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.160
although I'm not neurotic about it and my children wore them, same as everybody else, but I don't feel comfortable about them.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.480
And I have a very very strong memory of that time, which I

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.480
always relate to people because it made a big, it had a big influence on me. I remember the teacher telling the children

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that we have a new regime now,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.400
and

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.400
you'll have noticed that things are different.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.760
And I want you to promise me that you will come and tell me if you hear your parents or any of their friends

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.880
or your brothers and sisters saying anything nasty about this new regime that we have, you have to come and report to me.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.480
So what she was doing, she was encouraging the children to tell on their parents, as we say.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.400
And I found at age 10 that that was intolerable.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:57.080
I was age 67, I still find it intolerable. And when I was training teachers, every year group that I

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.960
worked with, I invariably told them you must do what you think is right.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.200
You must work out what you think is right and stick with that, not just what they are telling you.
