00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
or I was here in the house.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And I can't remember the date,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but I was eight and a half months pregnant with Catherine,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and of course I had worked in the call board only three years earlier.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'd left the call board, which was the South Western Division,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
South Wales, in clinician in Cardiff.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And so I knew, I won't say any names,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but I can remember who would have been involved with some of the mechanical or whatever things

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that was tipping, when they were tipping, you say.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So it was a shock, terrible shock.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And I can remember the pictures on television.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And also, my father, he was a labourer on one of the housing sites just above Merthyr Tydfil,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
fairly near the Prince Charles Hospital.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And a lot of the workers with him decided we must go and help.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And so they must have drove down there in their van or whatever.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And there were so many people there, they couldn't really help.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So that's one of the things I was told with my father.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And also my brother, my elder brother, he worked in the National Call Board at one time,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but became a maths lecturer later on.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But he also wanted to go and help.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
He was down in Newport, I believe, at the time,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but there were so many people wanting to help,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
so many miners wanting to go there and take all this from the school and the houses.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But they couldn't do anything, you see.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
There were already people organised.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
There's only so many people you can take to a place like that, you know.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And I remember the one house, or one of the houses next to the school,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
also disappeared under the rubble.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And I can remember that man, he lost his wife and all his family in that house.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It was just, you know, unbelievable, really.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And also there was a, the word isn't vicar,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
he could have been a reverend or a preacher,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and he had to go round to the families, I remember him being interviewed,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
round to the families to, you know, to say things to the people who had lost their children.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And he had to leave his wife, and they had lost a child.
