00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I think the one that I do remember would be the Aberfan disaster actually.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We had a television in the staff room in the school I was teaching in.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We must have done, because I didn't have one where I was staying.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And a lot of the staff were there and we were watching this unfolding together.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And that made a very profound impression on me.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I have to say it...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I would almost say it emphasised my Welshness.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I was teaching in York, amidst English people, and I watched this terrible thing happening.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And suddenly I thought, these are my people that are dying here.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And it sort of made me much more pro-Welsh, I think, as the effect it had.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Before I hadn't thought about it very much.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'd said my adnod, my verse, in chapel every Sunday.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And in a way I never really felt fully part of either English or Welsh.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Because being brought up as a small child, learning to talk, I learned Welsh first.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And then we lived in Pembrokeshire, where they have quite a strong Welsh accent,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but they didn't speak Welsh in the area we were in.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So I must have learnt Welsh when I started school.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And then coming back to Chester, all my education was in English.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The only Welsh I had really was going to chapel on a Sunday morning and learning a verse.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So it hadn't really...

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You know, it got established in my... my roots were Welsh.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But when I saw the Aberfan disaster, then there was no doubting it, I was Welsh.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And ever since then I've done a lot more in the way of learning to speak more Welsh,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
learning to read it and write it and even doing an AS level in it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So that was a very... you know, it was a turning point, I think, for me, for a lot of things that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And again, it was only black and white television,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but it didn't have to be coloured to emphasise the terrible things that happened.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And I think all the people around me, the other staff who were watching,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
you know, we all felt the same that this was a disgrace, it shouldn't have happened.
