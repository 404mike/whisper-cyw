00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Princess Diana's death was a strange affair altogether.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I mean, the death itself was a terrific tragedy.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But the concentration of what on this sort of emotion in the streets was, I don't know, weird.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Whether we concentrated too much on things like the flowers and the media went to town well and truly.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I was sorry for the royal family in some ways because they were not conditioned for this sort of...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I won't say what the emotion wasn't genuine, it was, but there was this, I don't know,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
a sense of artificiality about the whole thing.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You were looking at something that really you weren't belonging to.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You were watching a film all the time.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And people were making impassioned speeches one way and the other, and then the funeral was a nightmare.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I found the funeral very difficult to watch.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Very difficult.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I felt we had intruded upon something that we should not have intruded upon.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I felt sorry for everybody concerned.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Very, very sorry for them.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And we all, everybody glued to the television, lapping up every change of mood and everything that anybody said or did.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And the camera can be very cruel on times.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It catches you inadvertently, you know, and faces change.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Very, very difficult to cope with.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And do you think the death actually made people vote in a different way?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I think so.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I think we were sobered up a bit and we started to think seriously.
