00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Track 9, Beguiling Farm. It was a lovely place.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Prior to the erection of the metal shed, a far more impressive building once stood to your right.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It was a mansion, a big mansion.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And then the visitors and the one that owned the lake and the shooting

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
was coming there to stay for a few weeks in the summer.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And then we had to look after it. It was empty during the winter.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The six-bedroom mansion provided accommodation for paying guests to fish and shoot game.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
During the early 20th century it was the job of Gwen Rees' father to ensure both were in plentiful supply.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now there is very little game left because the Heather Moreland has been all but destroyed,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but the lake is kept well stocked.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I was born in 1917. And I was born and brought up in Beguiling.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It was lovely there. Five miles from the nearest house.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We were all alone there and we were four children.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It wasn't our farm. My father was a shepherd and a keeper there.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And he was looking after a few thousand sheep there.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Gwen and her father lived in the now derelict building, nestled amongst the trees downhill and leftwards from the sheds.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Today this building is all that remains of the Beguiling farmstead.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
To supplement the wages they were also allowed to keep a horse, cows and sheep.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Whilst money was in short supply, the bountiful supply of peat kept them warm.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We were cutting it in the ground. Making big places in the ground and cutting them and doing them up ourselves.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Putting them into a stack. And then in about September carrying them all into a big shed.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And that was enough for us for the whole winter and summer like.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
For some of the men who worked here, a peat fire was the perfect opportunity to dry out.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
One other chap who apparently he never possessed an overcoat.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And so more often than not if you met him in somebody else's house it was basically a cloud of steam in the corner from the fire.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Although all the moisture from his clothes rising as he was drying out.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
By the time Gwen had reached 17, her family moved to a farm in Aberhossan a few miles away.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But she will always have fond memories.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It was a lovely place because that's what I had started living in.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I nearly broke my heart when I came from there.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It was great you know, though we are far walking nearly five minutes to chapel and back.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And if we went to the shop it was still near in Aberhossan.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Yes and going up the rocks over there.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Yes, all weathers.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Yes, it was a long way to carry food and over back you know.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But my father was ordering a lot of things at the beginning of the winter.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Five sacks of flour and a big bag of tea.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And I don't know how much of sugar, everything like that.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And then they were in the house for the whole winter.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It was snowed in for a few days.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Then we had to make tracks to go out to the shed and things you know.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
At our final stop we will not only discover what is being done to support today's farmers.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But what is also in store for their grandchildren too.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Retrace your steps back uphill through the gate.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And continue to follow the track for vehicles round to the right.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Beyond where you joined it when you came up from the cattle pasture.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Soon Glasslinn Lake will come into view on your left.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Listen to track 10 after passing through another metal field gate.
