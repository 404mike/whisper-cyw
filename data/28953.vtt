The Great House and the Well. The Great House, known as T. Mowre in Welsh, is an

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.680
Elizabethan manor house. It's a grade two listed building that was built around

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.020
1569. It's sometimes known as the Earl of Leicester's house. Sir Robert Sidney, who

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.100
became Earl of Leicester in 1618, took ownership of the Coitie estate on his

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.800
marriage in 1584. And it is possible that he and his wife lived in the house for a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.860
year until he was elected Member of Parliament for Glamorganshire in 1585.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.460
But following his election they are known to have lived mainly in London. The

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.780
assumption that this house was part of the Coitie estate has therefore not been

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.380
proven. When the Coitie estate was bought by Samuel Edwin in 1718, T. Mowre, or the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.580
Great House, was not included in the sale. Hence the romantic idea that the house

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.420
once belonged to the Earl of Leicester is no more than that, at least until

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.180
someone proves otherwise. During the winter the house was said to use heat

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.580
from wintering cattle in an abutting barn as a kind of central heating. This

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.660
is one of the stories often told to diners at the Great House, which is now a

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.020
hotel and restaurant. As you continue the trail past the Great House and then

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.940
behind it, you'll reach Well Street. Until 1928 there was no mains water

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.420
available in the village. The well situated on this street was the main

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.860
source of water to the villagers. In times of drought, it is said, each household was

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.580
permitted just two gallons of water per day.
