00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I've been an elder of the church here since 1962, I think it is, so more than 50 years.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So I've been involved in the changes that have taken place in the church since 1950s when I came here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The original building was called Corporation Road Forward Movement Hall in 1900,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which was a building which held 2,000 people, which was part of the Welsh Revival in Wales,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
where preachers came full of hul, have you ever heard of hul?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Where they got very, very strong preachers jumping up and down and shouting and all kinds of things.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And the person who was part of that original Welsh Revival was called Roderick Jones,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and everybody knew Uncle Roderick, they called him, I never knew him,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but he was the person who set it all going until the 1950s really, so the church was here through both wars,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and we've got some artefacts of memorials.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It's interesting that the memorial to the first World War people, there's over 50 people who died from the church here.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Second World War, there was 12, I think.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So what's happened, 2,000 people in 1900 gradually, gradually as the church changed over the years,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
120 people in about the 1950s when the church people had to decide what to do with the building

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because it started to fall down when land-worn steelworks was being built by the lorries causing,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
exacerbating cracks that had begun to appear in 1908.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In 1908, the back end of the building had to be tied to the front end to stop it falling over because there was no foundations.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Oh, can you build a building for me? Oh dear.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Anyway, in the 1950s it started to fall down to such a degree that the church had to make a decision what to do.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Pull the building down, cut it in half so it was only the bottom half, or buttress it so that it held up the various bits.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And we then embarked on a series of studies, Bible studies, report studies from the World Council of Churches,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
looking at, and I can remember the title of the report was, What on Earth is the Church for?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Which is a very good title.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And one of the reports came up with the answer, the church is for others.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's not for itself, it's for others.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And we worked through that and as a result of that then decided that the building we wanted in order to be the church for others was more of a community building.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
When he said we, you mean? Yes, who's the we?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It's the members who were divided up into house groups between 10 and 12 people who met together, I think probably monthly to begin with,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
to consider this question, what are we going to do with this building and how are we going to use it?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And that's when we began to gather together answers as to what on earth is the church for.
