00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
A spaceship. The next breakthrough in car ownership came about as a result of the government's

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.640
privatisation programme, where my regional electricity company was floated as a PLC,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.320
that is Public Limited Company. Along with personal contracts, new job titles and share

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.240
options, the previously restricted list of approved manufacturers was expanded to include

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.440
other European carmakers. This was eagerly embraced by managers in the company and soon

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.480
our car park was filling up with gleaming new BMWs and bottom of the range Mercedes.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.400
Neither of these appealed to me, but at last a company van was possible, or more correctly

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.960
an MPV in the form of a Renault Espace. This was the Mark 2 Espace and to my mind an improvement

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.920
over the boxy first attempt. Certainly the load carrying ability was very attractive apart from

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.920
anything else, but this car was to provide new levels of auto equipment to my car ownership.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.680
Remote central locking with an alarm, air conditioning, essential with all the glass,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.160
a decent stereo with a multi-CD player and controls on the stalk for the driver,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.280
seven seats and a number of permutations. It was even possible to swivel the two front seats

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.240
around to face the two at the very back with a single seat folded down in the middle to form a table.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.920
The new car must have for some reason was cup holders and he had lots of these.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.920
The Espace was my first car equipped with air conditioning, common in cars nowadays,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.280
but much rarer then and the Espace had a particularly powerful unit. I was delighting

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.640
putting it down to the coldest setting and putting the fan on full and it was possible

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.720
to see people's breath condensing and getting them shivering when I would innocently inquire

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.480
whether it was cool enough yet. The load carrying was tested early on when I discovered that the

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.160
data centre at work had loads of clean wooden pallets to dispose of and by removing all the

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.440
five rear seats I could bring home seven or eight of these to construct giant compost bins in the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:19.040
garden, most useful. The car had a two litre injection engine with anti-lock braking systems

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.520
and despite its size was relatively light so gave a spirited performance for such a big vehicle of

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.320
that era. Some of this was down to the so-called space age composite body panels, probably some

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.320
kind of plastic I guess. It would be good to be able to say that all this sophisticated European

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.560
design meant that the car was reliable and a joy to own and drive and it was apart from one

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.080
memorably scary incident where this car appeared to be taken over by evil spirits.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.720
Returning to Sussex along the Eastbound M4 one evening after a work trip I was rather

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.880
shocked to see all the warning lights on the dashboard starting to flash on and off

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.920
randomly. I quickly pulled over onto the hard shoulder and turned off the ignition.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.280
I was just about to restart it and hope that the warning lights would go out when the engine

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.200
started itself. I took the key out of the ignition and got out grabbing my coat and briefcase.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.400
Standing beside it holding the ignition key I was mystified that the engine was still running.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.280
Then I had a brainwave and used the remote control ignition key to lock the car calculating that the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.800
immobiliser would cut the ignition which it did but for some reason the alarm then went off.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.040
Pressing the key to unlock it only took a few seconds before the engine started itself again.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.080
I'm standing outside holding the ignition key. I know that today using remote apps it's now

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.760
possible to start your engine remotely and even drive a car remotely into a parking space

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.160
but this technology wasn't to my knowledge available in the mid 1990s unless I had unbeknownst

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.280
to me been provided with some advanced future car technology testbed by Renault. So it was a choice

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.720
car locked engine off but alarm going or alarm off and the engine running. Luckily my company

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.360
mobile phone had been upgraded from an in-car model to one that could be removed and worked

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.600
outside so I rang the RAC which we had membership of through the company. They took the details of

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.040
the last junction I remembered passing and told me to wait away from the car and asked if I noticed

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.400
any burning smells or smoke. There might have been some rubber on the road either from me stopping or

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.160
me sprinting from the car but I avoided mentioning this. They warned me the response time could be

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.600
over an hour and that the fire brigade might attend as it sounded electrical. I was tempted

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.080
to suggest calling Ghostbusters then remembered they were fictional. So I sat up on the grass

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.480
bank and phoned home and explained yes I was likely to be delayed and yes the car alarm was ours but

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.920
if I switched it off I was fearful of the car driving itself away. I was tempted to open up the

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.200
car again and switch on all the electrics to try and run down the car battery as quickly as possible

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.000
and shut off the alarm but in truth having explained the bizarre symptoms three times

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.760
including twice to the RAC I'm not sure believe me at the first telling I was now a little scared

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.920
of the car and fairly wary of going near it. It was quite a pleasant spring evening and could have

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.960
been quite peaceful sitting above the quiet motorway were it not for the insistent car alarm.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.360
This was soon drowned out though unfortunately by a fire engine siren which was coming from a full

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.480
size fire engine as it roared up and stopped behind the possessed car. It escorted several

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.240
firemen two in suits with breathing apparatus and one without asking for the keys and trying to

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.000
understand what I was saying over the double noise of the alarm and the siren which they

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.520
haven't switched off. Once the car was unlocked they went to open the bonnet but of course the

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.560
engine started which certainly startled the fireman who was about to stick his arm in the engine

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.160
despite me explaining about the problem. So we went through the lock in the car to stop the engine

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.280
routine and then shouted at each other over the alarm which thankfully was no longer accompanied

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.360
by their siren. This was now silent maybe because having now had enough excitement from having a

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.760
limb potentially removed they decided to calm things down a bit. One fireman disconnected the

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.400
battery while he came over to tell me this his colleague would appear to still be enjoying his

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.480
own adrenaline rush as he filled the engine compartment with foam from a fire extinguisher,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.800
a large one. I was now past caring so I wished them a thanks and goodbye and waited for the RIC

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.360
recovery vehicle. I was hoping it would arrive before dark as I couldn't put the car's lights on.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.160
Remembering there was a breakdown triangle in the boot I cautiously walked 50 yards back down the

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.040
hard shoulder and put that up as a precaution. Thankfully the RIC man arrived before sunset and

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.000
a couple of hours later I was dropped off home with the car being collected by an apologetic

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.040
mechanic from the Renault dealer. The car was taken away for another low loader trip and I

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.200
was left with a replacement car which hopefully was less autonomous. Some days later the sales

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.080
manager rang up full of apologies and the usual excuse that this has never happened before to his

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.360
knowledge allowing me to say that that was of little comfort to me as it had happened in every

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.440
Renault Espace that I'd owned and I was not impressed. Upon return of the errant car it was

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.720
explained to me that the wiring loom had been completely replaced as it was too tight passing

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.800
into the engine bay from behind the dashboard and there was a suspicion of a rubber insulating grommet

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.520
that had been missed. This had frayed, shortened the wiring and luckily had not caused a fire.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.920
It was a little while before I trusted the car enough to be good friends again.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.560
Ford again. When it was time to replace the Renault the company allowed us to do this every three

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.000
years. It was always an opportunity to try something else and at somebody else's expense the risk

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.080
always seemed minimized. We got used to the space flexibility and higher driving position of the

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.600
Espace so we looked around for an alternative in the range that had come to be called people carriers.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.480
A ridiculously redundant term as surely this was a feature of all cars and other vehicles nevertheless

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.360
the market for these was growing in popularity and Ford had joined the market with a joint

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:42.480
development with Volkswagen, the Ford Galaxy and the VW Charon. Now call me old-fashioned but I

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.560
didn't fancy owning a Charon or even a Charan, no offense it's a lovely name but at least the

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.800
Galaxy shares its title as something astronomical and a chocolate bar. In any event the Ford has

00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.320
better value in my allowed price range probably because the company bought a lot more Ford vehicles

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:06.880
mostly transit vans than they bought VWs. I don't know or maybe it was a badge premium

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.960
exercised by the German company as the models are virtually identical.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:18.320
The car was to be a Galaxy 2.0-litre gear and petrol as it was the early days of the ill-judged

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.080
let's all move to more economical and greener diesel engines. What a cul-de-sac that has turned

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.160
out to be. As cars were becoming more alike in appearance and some of this was down to

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:36.560
aerodynamics and drag coefficients it was not easy to select them based on brand. In fact a friend

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.960
who was also entitled to a company car claimed to select his on two important criteria.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
How comfortable the driver's seat was, he drove all over the country in parts of

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.280
mainland Europe and secondly how easy it was to operate the sound system and how loud it was.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.880
I'm sure this simplified things when he was not seduced by issues of branding and design.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:05.040
I'm not so single-minded and swayed by the upmarket luxury features of the Ford gear model,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.640
that's what the brochure said. I selected a metallic maroon model but let's be realistic

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.800
here it's basically a van with more windows and stuff full of thick carpet and six armchairs

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.560
in a hideously grey patterned velour that could have come from the DFS novo bilious range.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:30.480
It was well equipped with the so-called luxuries including electric sunroof, six electric windows,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.720
CD multiplayer, heated front windscreen, climate control, rear heater controls and enough map

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:43.520
reading and courtesy lights to equip a Christmas tree amongst other refinements. It was impossible

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.640
to order a 12-volt small fridge that clipped in place of one of the rear seats so we had one of

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:55.840
those as an extra and very civilised it was too for picnics. Mechanically it was a two-litre

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:02.400
double overhead camshaft Ford petrol engine with ABS and traction control and described by

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.360
Ford's marketing department as providing lively performance with impressive economy.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:16.000
The power output was an increase over the Renault 115bhp against 105 but the Ford was considerably

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.640
heavier at kerb weight. What is that? It was 1650kg to the lighter Renault's 1320kg.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:33.040
The lively performance of 12 seconds to 0-60 and 110 top speed doesn't sound so impressive by

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:39.680
modern standards today but despite its weight it was livelier than the Espace that claimed a 0-60

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:46.240
at 13.5 seconds. The extra weight did make it feel more solid and stable but maybe it was the arm

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.120
rest on the seats that helped with that. I've always felt the Renault could use more power

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.960
and some lunatic of Renault agreed but maybe went a little too far. To celebrate the 10th

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:03.680
anniversary of Renault's Formula One involvement the Espace F1 show car was developed using a

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:11.440
carbon fibre reinforced body and a chassis. A three and a half litre V10 engine from a 1993

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:17.920
Williams Renault car was mounted mid-engine and powered the rear wheels race car semi-automatic

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:28.640
gearbox. The performance was electrifying 0-60 in 2.8 seconds, 0-124mph in under 7 seconds plus a

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:35.280
top speed of 195mph. I wouldn't mind a go in that although there was no room behind the front seats

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:41.600
for passengers and it apparently got a little too warm inside for an Irish war found. I'm racking

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.040
my brains to think of any memorable experience of a galactic or otherwise nature world stone in the

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:56.240
car. Maybe it's the way with forwards as with the Sierra it just does what it says on the tin.
