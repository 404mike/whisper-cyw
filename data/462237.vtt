00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If there was no television, well, we would do other things.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.040
There's no question about that.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.360
There are some people who say they never watch television.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.700
They are the exception.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.840
I watched television, and when I was not retired,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.840
it was the way I'd switch off at night.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.080
I'd come home, by the time I'd had my dinner,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.280
it was about half past eight, nine o'clock.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.200
And then, if I didn't have work to do, sometimes I did,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.760
I'd switch off by watching television

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.540
at about nine o'clock at night.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.620
And I'd watch till quite late,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.240
because I didn't need a lot of sleep.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.160
So I'd watch till quite late.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.440
Sometimes I'd watch for a few hours and do some work.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.880
But I, yes, it certainly has influenced leisure time.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.680
And has that changed over time,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.240
that it influences more now than it did?

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.360
It's actually less.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.160
I'm doing more reading.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.880
I, a funny person, I can't read.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.680
I couldn't read when I was working,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.360
because my job involved reading.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.760
I was reading texts or whatever, all the time.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.520
And so I didn't read at night.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.480
When I'd go on holiday, I'd go through piles of books.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.960
Since I've retired in March,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.160
I must have gone through to 50 or 60.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.840
I've got books all over the place.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.440
I'm reading books all the time.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.400
And so what actually we do now, we sit down and read books.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.040
And then perhaps we can go and watch television,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.400
watch the news, or if there's something good on,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.240
we'll go and watch it.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.680
But we tend to read now.
