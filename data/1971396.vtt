00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We pretty much remember most of our, even if it's the same ship in the same season or different seasons, it's always different.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Because it's different passengers, different weather, different market stalls or different musicians come in.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So everyone sounds unique to us. I mean, obviously some are more memorable than others.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Yeah, we were really nervous, obviously, because it was the first kind of live event and we'd been planning for months.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And we'd had to do it from scratch. We had to come up with a logo, the name, all the branding, the material, the promotion and the kind of guidelines to the ship.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And then the volunteer group of friendly faces, you know, we had to recruit and train and all of that kind of thing.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So it had been a really busy, hectic kind of four months. And then all of a sudden, the day was the day sort of thing.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It was just one of the smaller ships, the Corinthian, who comes back about 10 times through the season each year.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
They were our first and which was probably just as well because there's only 100 passengers on there.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But yeah, everything went off as we planned. You know, in fact, it better really. They were really pleased.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We were really chuffed. It was a very exciting and tiring day. At that point, we did a welcome and a farewell for the smaller ship.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So it was literally all day for us. But that's evolved into just welcomes for the smaller ships now.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Yeah, we had musicians, we had I couldn't tell you which entertainment then because that was a while ago.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We've had quite a lot of them since. But yeah, we had a good little team because obviously it was early start of the friendly faces.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And it was fun.
