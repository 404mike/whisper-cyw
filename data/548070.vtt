00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Tomorrow shall be my dancing day, tomorrow shall be my dancing day.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I've got my trot up in some chest to sing a legend of my place,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to call my trot up to my dance, sing of my love, sing of my song, my love, my love.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's have a turn for my tune.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Was I born of a virgin? Was I born of a virgin?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
How come that you have fleshly substance, most was I meant to?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And did you, do you love my tune? Do you love my dance?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Sing of my love, my love, my love. Let's have a turn for my tune.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In angelic and mountainous, in an angelic and mountainous,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:33.000
so fair before this was my chance, between this and the still before us,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to call my tune a tune.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Tomorrow shall be my dancing day, tomorrow shall be my dancing day.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I've got my trot up in some chest to sing a legend of my place,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to call my tune a tune.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Sing of my love, my love, my love. Let's have a turn for my tune.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Sing of my love, my love, my love. Let's have a turn for my tune.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Thanks for watching!
