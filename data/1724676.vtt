00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So why are you still friends with each other after all these years?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Because I think Jen's cool.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We... I'm not disagreeing with that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I guess, well why would we be I suppose?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Because we got along in work

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and although like we're doing very different things now

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that has an impact like on when we can meet up and stuff

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
like you were kids and I'm studying.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You'll have kids soon.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm going to have kids soon, yeah, which will change things again.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So it's made it difficult to stay in like close contact

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
because we were kind of operating in different like...

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And I don't drive as well, I think if I drove it means yeah.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Because I could just bring you and Shavu or you two up too.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yeah.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Come down for an hour like...

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But it's not viable to come down for an hour when you don't drive

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
because this journey is what?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
20 minutes from where I live in a car

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
but it's like 45 minutes on a train and then it's 20 minute walk.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So like it doesn't work out.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So if we see each other it's like on the weekends.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Yeah and it's for a couple of hours, isn't it?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Yeah we like do it, we're doing a thing.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm like seeing something or going somewhere

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
because of the practicalities.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Yeah.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But yeah, no...

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Well I guess we've stayed in contact

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
because we enjoyed each other's company

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and we both valued the friendship and the things we got from that.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And plus you're the best godmother ever.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And that.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Just be honest.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
She loves her auntie Jen.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
My godmother.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So yeah, you'll be living with her now, carry on.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Tell her that all the time.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
She's like, I will move there.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm like, yeah I bet you would as well.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm waiting for her to knock on the door.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Come for an email, Vee.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
She'll live with me then.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm not doing teenagers.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Give her a 480.
