00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is what, 1979?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
1979, yeah.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And that just went from strength to strength.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I really never looked back.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We went through all the various recessions,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the 80s, and we went

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
another recession, I don't know,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
whenever it was, about 2000.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Usually, it was all

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
geared to the price of silver.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If silver went up, our stuff

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
was made of copper and silver.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It was much harder to sell stuff.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Once you had to buy silver

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
at a high price, and you couldn't really

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
increase the selling price.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But we came through all that, and then

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
at its peak, I was employing

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
30 people. We had

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
three units. We had a company in

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Manchester. And then in

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
2003, I decided that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I got nearly 70

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that I wanted to retire.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So one of my competitors

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
bought it out, and promptly

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
closed it down.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They just wanted to get rid of a competitor,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which was fair enough, but they left me

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
with a battery company.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And then we went into partnership

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
with a big firm in India,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which actually made the batteries, and we

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
just sold them here.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Well, in the end, we were turning

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
over 6 million. It was a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
big company. And then the Indians

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
decided that they either

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
wanted us to buy them out, or

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
they would buy us out.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
By then, I was

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
well into my 70s,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
nearly 80. I didn't want to work anymore.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And we sold the shares.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
My daughter stayed on for a bit longer.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
She was working with me, but

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
then she left as well,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
because she couldn't stand working for the Indians.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
She started her shop,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which is by the station in Panaath.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And now I work for my daughter.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Packing parcels.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That's your morning job,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
aren't you? The wheelers can't fall

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in a circle, isn't it? Electrical spare parts,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and you said you had some units. Where were they?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
They were on East Moors Road

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in Cardiff.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's down by the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
steelworks.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And that was employing 30 people?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Well, at its peak, yes.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It started off with just a handful,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but gradually it just grew and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
grew and grew. We had 6 reps,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
people travelling round,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and we supplied all spares

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
for every Maker forklift truck.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We went to all the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
big users, the supermarkets,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to Sainsbury's,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
to Tesco's, to Safeways.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We supplied them all, and we

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
even supplied the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Makers of the forklift trucks,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
the big firms like Lansing

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Bagnall or Heister or

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Jungheinrich, because they

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
needed other people's spares,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
you see. Lansing Bagnall

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
would need spares for Heister trucks.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Now, they didn't want to go to Heister

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to buy them. They would come to us.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It all worked very well.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It was great fun.
