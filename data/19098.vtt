00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
On the days I was 12, I went underground.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But a period before that, they were going under much younger.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And an old woman told me she used to live here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Her father used to carry her into the work. It was a level, you see.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
She used to carry her into clean motorhams.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You see, the motorhams they could have if they could fill the coal.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And she worked underground. Oh yes.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
At a place called Beaufort.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Were there any girls working underground when you started?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Oh no. Oh no. The Lord prohibited that. Yes. Oh yes.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
They were working on the surface though, were they?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Oh yes. Working on the screens, clipping the coal, pushing the drums,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
greasing the axles of the drums and all sorts of things like that, you see.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Oh yes, there was a batch up there working.
