00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
And he went down to work down the pit and he looked after the ponies, the pit ponies.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.240
Pit ponies had stables down the pit and they lived down there.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.900
So they had very poor light.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.480
They didn't get sunlight so they had to have their skin looked after and they generally

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.340
didn't have as healthy a life as they ought to have.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.100
So for two weeks a year when the pit shut down for maintenance and all the miners went

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:38.100
away on holiday, the ponies used to go to local farms and just let, they were let free

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.900
in the good pastures to get some sun and to run around and do what they wanted to do and

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.380
get some decent grass.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.500
This guy used to go with his ponies and look after them while they were in the fields as well.
