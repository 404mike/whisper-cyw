00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
At HDA we'd like to say thank you to Heritage Lottery for supporting us with the development

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:17.200
of this short series of podcasts which are about U-Town, Tiger Bay, Cardiff Docs. This

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:28.400
particular broadcast is just a short explanation, let's say, of Cardiff's Norwegian Church.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:37.240
It was founded by Herman Lundt of Oslo in 1868. The wooden building originally stood

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.800
between the East and West docks on land donated by the Marquis of Bute. The gallery and the

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.960
bell tower were added in 1885. It is the oldest church built overseas by the Norwegian seamen's

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:02.800
mission to survive intact. Scandinavian seamen worked on ships which came to Cardiff. The

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.480
church, designed like a village church back home, was a haven in the bustling port where

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.720
the seamen could meet, worship, read periodicals from their native countries or write letters

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:28.360
home. After the decline of the coal trade the church was closed in 1974 and had a period where

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:38.280
it fell into decay. But in 1987 it was dismantled by the Norwegian Church Preservation Trust which

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.120
also kept many of the interior fittings. The trust raised 250,000 pounds in Wales and Norway

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:57.320
to re-erack the church on its present site where Prince Martha Louise of Norway opened it to the public in 1992.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:06.320
And if anyone who's been there will know if you sit outside there and have a cup of coffee you get an excellent view of the pier head,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:14.680
the Welsh assembly building and all of the new shops and bars and restaurants.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:24.760
The trust's first president was the children's author Roald Dahl who was christened in the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.240
church in 1916. His father Harold who worshipped at the church hailed from Oslo and had co-founded

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:41.360
the Addison and Dahl Ship Broken Company in Cardiff in 1880. The company also had offices

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.760
in Swansea, Port Talbot and Newport. Roald Dahl died in 1990. Every year his birthday

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.560
is celebrated at the church with a party for local children. The church is now a venue

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:05.000
for arts exhibitions and events and meetings of the Welsh-Norwegian society with the coffee

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.160
bar seeking to add a bit of Scandinavian cuisine. The church reopened in May 2011 after further

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.040
renovation funded by the Landfill Communities Funds and with assistance from Hoardland County

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:30.120
Council Norway. In the 19th century Cardiff of course was one of Britain's three major

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.080
ports along with London and Liverpool. The Norwegian merchant fleet at the time was the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.720
third largest in the world and Cardiff became one of its major centres of operation which

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:51.160
clearly meant an awful lot of people from Norway and its surrounding nations came to

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:59.520
Cardiff. Sjomanskirken which is the Norwegian church abroad organisation which is part of

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:08.000
the Church of Norway followed in its footsteps. Under Carl Hermann Lund from Oslo the church

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.880
was built to serve the religious needs of Norwegian sailors and expatriates as I've said. It was

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.800
consecrated in December 1868. The church was clad in iron sheets originally on the instruction

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:31.000
of the harbour master to allow it to be moved if necessary. However the construction that form

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.000
meant it could also be extended many times. In 1883 a reading room was enlarged, in 1885 the gallery

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.840
and bell tower added and in 1894 the reading room was enlarged again and re-clad in wood. It was

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:57.280
known at that and until that point as the Norwegian iron church. It later became known as the Little

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:06.720
White Church and become a welcome home point for sailors. Between 1867 and 1915 the number of

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:25.040
visiting sailors to the church rose from 7,572 to 73,580 seamen per year. So when it was originally

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.760
built and in its prime it had a lot of public activity from the Nordic community settling in

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:41.840
Cardiff and making routes there to the Norwegian sailors using the place as a rest stop. It was

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.560
also became a home away from home for sailors during World War II as they weren't able to go

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:56.960
back to Norway due to Nazi occupation and increasingly the church hosted many important

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:05.040
family occasions such as weddings and christening. Now coal exports had been declining and post World

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:13.760
War II shipping trade had moved from Cardiff and in 1959 the mission's work was discontinued. In the

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:21.200
early 1960s the Norwegian seamen's mission withdrew its patronage from the little church

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.760
and the last seaman priest Per Conrad Hansen was withdrawn.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:35.360
The residual congregation and other Lutheran organizations funded its continuing use by the

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:45.680
resident expatriate Norwegian community but it was closed and deconsecrated in 1974 as a church.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:59.040
Because of Roald Dahl's contribution as the first president of the Norwegian church

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:07.680
and certainly his support in fundraising a room in the church is named the Dahl Gamera Gallery.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.920
Thanks to the successful work of the Norwegian Church Preservation Trust

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:28.000
the church was moved, reconstructed and preserved and is still there and it's an excellent place

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.040
for events and coffee etc.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:42.880
And here's an example once again of how you can preserve a building.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:56.480
Sadly it also reminds us that no one bothered trying to preserve the homes of the people of Bute Town

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:05.920
but nonetheless the Norwegian church is a beautiful building.
