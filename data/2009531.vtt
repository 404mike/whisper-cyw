00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.400
My name is Sam and I've been going to gigs in Newport since the early 90s, probably around

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.840
93, 94. My very early memories are I used to work in a pub in Pontypool called The Globe

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.120
and that was very much like a heavy metal bikers pub and I was 14 and they used to drag me to gigs

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.880
in TJ's and I used to have to sneak in because John knows my family so we used to have to pretend

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.960
that I was my older sister and he didn't find out for about five years so that was fun. He used to

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.320
say to me how's the baby meaning me and I'd reply with oh she's in school she's doing her GCSEs and

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.520
it was only when a load of my friends turned up with um 18th birthday balloons on my 18th birthday

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.160
that he twigged that I was not Amanda I was actually the baby that he'd been asking about

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.480
for the last five years because he hadn't seen any of us because he was friends with my parents

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.600
when I was about three or four and then my parents moved back to the Midlands for 10 years so we

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.440
hadn't seen him so all he knew was he recognized the face and he was like you've got to be Pete

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.080
and Chris's and I was like oh yeah I'm Amanda I'm Amanda and my sister was actually 10 years

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.160
older than me as well and he still believed me so he was quite angry when he sussed it though

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.760
and he banned me for a month to teach me a lesson and then let me in the next week anyway so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.800
classic John. My first memory of TJs and the gig was getting lost in TJs even though it was really

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.480
small because it was so busy and I'm only five foot one and it was so busy that all I could see

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.120
was other people's shoulders I couldn't even see the stage or the bar and I'd had some drinks and

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.400
I completely lost like all sense of direction and I couldn't even work out which way was out and I

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.760
had like a proper panic attack of oh my god there's just shoulders everywhere and I managed to push

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.240
my way out and find myself by the toilets and I was like and breathe and I had to like re-center

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.560
myself and get like a whole sense of direction again because it used to get so busy in there.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.680
Most of the gigs I went to weren't that well attended so it would have been something the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.840
others dragged me along to because the ones that I went to there was normally about 20 of us

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.160
and Simon Phillips that was it and then I'd get dragged along to other stuff and I'd just get

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.480
drunk and lost because like pretty much La Pub is the only place gigs happen these days

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.000
since TJs closed. I always end up working even if I book the night off I'll end up oh god it's busy

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.160
I'm running behind the bar and things it's really yeah I think that's one of the things I'm struggling

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.120
with I've always worked these gigs I've never don't have a punter story because everything you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.960
know I've worked with every that's 20 years I've worked gigs they've happened in Newport I've worked

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.040
them. I think the problem is that I've got like sound bites from so many gigs and they're so good

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.040
and they're all so like important to the history of Newport musically that it's too difficult to

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.320
just pinpoint one and talk about it because I always get sidetracked when I start thinking about

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.560
the 60 foot dolls warm-up gig my brain then starts thinking about the kids in glass houses

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.440
warm-up gig where they played La Pub one day and then played Cardiff Stadium the next support in

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.800
Bon Jovi and my brain can't seem to concentrate on one and it's it's really yeah I'm really

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.160
struggling. It was more like the proper like punk bands like Rancid and stuff like that I saw Rancid

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:29.040
in TJs I saw Sam I Am I saw Cuba Patrol I saw Down by Law all of that level of punk gigs that

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.520
was the stuff I was going to early early on we only went to the Rancid gig because it said X

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.240
Operation Ivy on the poster and I was obsessed with Operation Ivy at the time and I was like oh

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.400
my god we've got to go we've got to go we've got to go and that was yeah that was probably the best

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.920
gig I think there was about 65 there maybe not that busy I mean it's a long long time ago so I

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.480
could be completely off but from my recollection there was about 65 to 100 people there certainly

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.440
wasn't sold out yeah just a really great gig I mean another band I saw in TJs that blows my mind

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.000
because there were only about 20 of us there was Enter Shikari that's that blows my mind so I

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.240
remember standing in front of them and thinking these are going to be absolutely huge I don't like

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.480
them they're not my thing but they are going to be absolutely massive there was a guy called Jay who

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.560
was working for us DJ and put the gig on and I only went along because Jay was putting a gig on

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.240
let's go show him some support and I remember standing there and thinking wow I think it's the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.080
only time I've ever really got I'm going to go all Simon Cowell but like the X factor it's the only

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.680
time I've ever stood in front of a band and known 100% this band are going to be huge I thought they

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.680
were rubbish in terms of what I liked because it's definitely nothing I like but I knew the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.080
second but literally the second they walked onto the stage I said yeah this these are going to be

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.560
effing huge
