00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000
She runs over the hillside Free and easy as the kite-light

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Like a drum her heart beats in time With ancient tales told in rhyme

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:58.000
She burns in my heart When fires set at the start

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Of all time, of all time Like lit but silver she blows through rivers and streams

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:32.000
A delicious walk dances through sunbeams And when I cry for a broken dream

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
She breathes new life and she mends torn seams

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:56.000
She burns in my heart When fires set at the start

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Of all time, of all time

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We sing with one voice We sing with one voice We sing with one voice

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:41.000
As hearts beat and rivers leave the sea A mother's love pours from you into me

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Our eyes reflect the crystal starlight from above The anger in my soul is released like a dove

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:25.000
She burns in my heart When fires set at the start Of all time, of all time

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Thanks for watching!
