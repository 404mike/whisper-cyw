00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.360
Well, I'm David Ambrose. I work as a storyteller. I work as a promoter of storytelling. I've

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.800
been an events promoter pretty much all my working life, with a deep interest in folklore,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.320
folk song especially, but obviously folk stories. I've got some Welsh background because

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.920
I've got a Welsh mum born and brought up in Swansea and so she very much knew about the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.840
Wasail tradition out on the gaur. So all of that has informed my storytelling and my singing.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.120
I'd like to tell you a story. This is a story that I believe comes from the West Country,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.280
but where I live on the coast, on the heritage coast as we now call it in the Vale of Glamorgan,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.720
there are such strong links between that part of Wales and the West Country just across the water.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.360
The Old Enemy as some of the old boys in my village still refer to England. You can see

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.240
it on a clear day. We don't get many of those, but you can see it. So this is a story from

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.520
there from Somerset. There was a farm and the farm was run by an old man and his two

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:30.000
sons. And then the time came, one midwinter, when the old man passed away. And so there

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.280
was a wake and there was a burial and then just before Christmas Eve the will was read out.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.000
Now everybody knew really what the will was going to say because the old man didn't have

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.320
very much other than his fields and his farmhouse. And it was the custom in that place that that

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.200
time that it was the youngest who would inherit everything, inherited the property and the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.640
oldest would get nothing. And so it was when the will was read out, the youngest brother

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.080
got the farmhouse and the fields and there was really nothing left for the eldest brother.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.160
And the following morning, Christmas Eve, the youngest brother called his eldest brother

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.240
into the front room and he said, oh brother, what a sad day this is, eh? When you're going

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.760
to have to leave the family home, the home where you were born and brought up because

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.520
of course this is now mine. But I'll tell you what, you're my brother and I'm not going

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.240
to see you out on your ear with no roof over your head. I'll tell you what I'm going to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.600
do for you. Because you're my brother, I'm going to let you stay in the old shepherd's

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.320
cottage. You know the one at the far end of our land, the other side of the hill? And

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.120
you can stay there for a whole year. And all I ask in return is in one year's time, you

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.600
give me a shilling for the rent. I can't say fairer than that. And the eldest brother,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.160
he shook his head, but he knew it was what had to be. And so he went off and he packed

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.840
a few things that he owned and he put them in a bag. He slung his bag over his shoulder

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.880
and he walked over the hill and down. And the evening was already getting gloomy and

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.560
chilly by the time he stepped up to that old cottage. And he hadn't been there for a long

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.280
time. And I tell you, the years and the weather had not been kind to it. And the satch was

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.520
missing off the roof and the windows were broken and the front door was hanging off

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.520
its hinges. And he stepped inside and he picked his way across the rotten floorboards and

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.520
he went out into the backyard. Sheltering in the lee of an old apple tree, there was

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.920
a donkey and an ox, each side of the trunk of that tree. And he looked at the donkey

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.200
in the gathering gloom and he could see that the donkey had one leg up off the ground.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.640
Looked in a bad way. And the fur of the donkey, it was mangy. And he looked at the ox and

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.840
the back of the ox, it was bending down, it didn't look good. And he looked at the tree

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.920
and the tree had three wizened old apples on it, each of them rotten. And the young

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.720
man, he turned back and he went into the house and he cleared the twigs and bits of dead

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.360
bird out of the grate and he managed to get a fire going and then he pulled his coat up

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.400
over himself and he went to sleep there on the floorboards. And the next morning he got

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.640
up and he knew what he was going to do. He walked out to the outskirts of the village,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.720
up to the top of the hill where the wise old woman's cottage was. And he spoke to her and

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.720
he told her all his troubles. And she said, my son, listen to me. You look after those

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.920
beasts and those beasts will look after you. You've got to restore their health with herbs.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.240
And you will see what you will see. And if you do that, you will restore your own fortune.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.600
So the young man, he took her advice. She told him which herbs to pick and what to do

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.840
with them, how to make them into a poultice. And day after day, he boiled up the herbs

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.920
and he applied the poultice to the donkey's fur and its gammy leg and he applied the hot

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.960
herby poultice to the back of the ox. And he did that all through the winter. By the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.960
spring, well, you could see the difference because the donkey's fur, where it had been

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.280
mangy, it was now beginning to get a sleek gloss to it. And he began to put his leg down

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.560
on the ground, did the donkey. And the back of the ox that had been so bent down was

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.560
beginning to straighten up like a good sturdy oak tabletop. And not only that, but he was

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.000
coming back. Come May, the apple tree began to put out beautiful blossom because what

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.200
was happening was this, that poultice that the young man left on the ground after he

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.600
finished rubbing it into the ox and the donkey. Well, the ox and the donkey, they ate it.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.600
And what goes in must come out. And that beautiful rich manure fed the roots of the apple tree

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.600
and now it was covered in sweet scented pink blossom. And come late summer, the branches

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.040
of the apple tree, they were bending down low, heavy with fruit. And the young man,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.520
he picked that fruit and most of it he sold in the market, but some he kept for himself

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.760
and turned it into cider. And when the winter evenings drew in, he could light the fire,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.640
he could pour himself a glass of his own cider and there he could sit and sup. And so it

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:40.280
came around to Christmas Eve. Just before Christmas Eve there's a knock at the door

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.280
and there's the youngest brother. Hello brother, how you doing, eh? I've just come to remind

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.640
you about that little matter of the rent that you owe me. Tomorrow, a silver shilling, I

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.320
hope you've got it. And the eldest brother said, well, I'm sorry, you know, it's been

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.280
hard for me and I haven't got it. Can you let me off? Wow, brother, I thought it might

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.600
be like that. So I'll tell you what, I'm going to make a bargain with you. You see, I've

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.760
been talking to some of the old people in the village and they tell me that somewhere

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.600
around this cottage there's some treasure buried. And they also tell me that when you've

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:27.440
got an ox and a donkey together on Christmas Eve, if you wait until the bells of midnight

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.920
start to ring out, you can hear what that ox and that donkey have to say to each other.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:40.240
So brother, here's my proposal. Tomorrow night, Christmas Eve, you spend the night up at the

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.000
old farmhouse. I spend the night down here and I'm going to listen to what your ox and

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.920
your donkey have to say about that buried treasure. And if you agree to that, I'll let

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.760
you off the rent. And the young man, once again, he just felt everything was against

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.720
him, but what else could he do but agree? And so the eldest brother, he's there in the

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.320
house, the youngest brother goes away up the hill, whistling, being very pleased with himself.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.840
Eldest brother, he went to go over to the fire. Before he sat down, he poured himself

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:17.960
some cider and it was the very last drop and it was cloudy, but he lifted it up. He was

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:24.120
just about to drink when he remembered an old custom. And he went outside into the yard

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:31.840
and he stood under the clear glittering star-filled sky and he raised that glass up towards the

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:40.600
old apple tree. And he said, apple tree, apple tree, I will give back to thou what thou has

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:49.160
given to me. And let's have hatfuls and capfuls and three bushel bagfuls and little apples

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:56.240
under the stairs. Hip, hip, hooray. And with that, he poured that cider all around the

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:02.360
roots of the tree and he took away the empty glass and he started to walk back to the house,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:10.240
to the cottage. And as he did so, from behind him, he heard a great big belch and he turned

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.000
around and he looked, but there was no one there. And he looked at the tree and he noticed

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.520
that the branches of the tree were beginning to bend down low to the ground and then rise

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:29.480
up and they bent down towards him three times. And when he looked again, he could see in

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:39.520
the folds of the trunk of the tree, something that looked like the face of an old man wrinkled

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:46.480
into a smile. And he said, apple tree, was that you? And the apple tree said, yes, it

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:55.000
was. And it's not every day that somebody gives me a taste of my own juice. Thank you

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.960
very much. You've been good to me, I'll be good to you. Do you know what? If you were

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:09.840
dig down underneath my roots, you would find a great big box of treasure. And if I was

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:15.080
you, I'd dig it up straight away and I'd hide it somewhere where no one else could

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:23.400
find it. And the young man, he stood there amazed and he couldn't speak, but he had

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:29.200
heard and as he watched, it seemed to him that the face disappeared back into the trunk

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.480
of the tree and it was just a tree again. But he didn't hesitate. He turned, he went

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.160
back to the house, he got a spade, he began to dig and sure enough, the spade struck something

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.720
hard. There was the lid of a treasure chest. He broke it open, lifted the lid and it was

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:50.840
full of Roman gold. And he hefted that chest out of the ground and he hid it somewhere

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:58.560
very safe indeed. And then the next day, he went up to the big house and the youngest

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:05.680
brother came down and took his place behind the door, listening out for what the ox and

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:12.280
the donkey would have to say. And at the first stroke of midnight, when the church bells

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:20.500
all over the land began to ring out for Christmas Eve, this is what the youngest brother heard.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:28.940
He heard the ox turn to the donkey and say, hello, donk, how you doing then? And the donkey

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:34.780
said to the ox, well, I'm not too bad. I tell you what, the diet's improved, hasn't it?

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:41.900
So it has said the ox. And how you feeling, donk? How you doing? Well, I tell you what,

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:48.700
said the donkey, my leg, the articulation is right back in it. Thank you very much.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:55.260
What about yourself, ox? Oh, said the ox, I'm feeling so good. I'm feeling so much better.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:01.700
Well, I'm feeling as strong as a, well, as strong as I've ever felt. And I'll tell you

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:09.260
another thing, donkey, says the ox. If that fool behind the door thinks he's going to

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:18.460
hear any secrets from us, he's got another think coming. And with that, the last stroke

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:27.460
of midnight rang out and the ox and the donkey, they fell silent. And the youngest brother,

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:34.580
he walked away empty handed. But if he had looked and if he had seen, he might have noticed

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:41.820
just the faint trace of a wrinkled smile amongst the gnarled bark of the old apple tree. Three

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:51.300
golden apples fell from the sky. One for the one who told the story, one for those who

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:58.820
listened and one for those who came before so long ago, who they are we do not know.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.820
And that's the end of my story.
