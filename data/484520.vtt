Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.920
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.620
Interviewee Elaine Morse.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.520
The venue is the Swicker office and the date today is Sunday the 16th of November 2014.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.960
Elaine, could you spell your name in full for the record please?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.520
Elaine Morse.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.520
M-O-R-S-E.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.520
Like Inspector.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.520
Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.040
How did you first get to hear of or get involved with the Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.040
Right, well I grew up in Cardiff and left for about 10 years, went to live in Canada

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:53.600
and then came back to Cardiff in about 2000 and was looking for community, you know, reconnect

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.880
and meet new people.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.120
Now my mum is a teacher in Glantau High School, she's a textiles teacher there and she said

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:12.080
hey, go down to Swicker, it's happening, the camp is opening, starting for the carnival

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.000
in July and I'm not sure, that might have been 2000, summer 2000 and that's how it started.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.480
I came when it was here at Chapter in the little next door.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480
The gym?

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.480
The gym is what we call it, when the camp was there, it was plastic all over the floor

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.360
and all the tables got set up and paint started flying around and I came to help with costume

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:52.200
and Kevin arrived and they started starting and I said, I'd love to learn stilt work.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.400
In about three minutes he said, go on then, strapped onto me, sat on a high wall, he

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.320
said one, two, three, up, right, walk, go on, go.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.320
Was that it?

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.520
That's the science of I'm still walking, demystified.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.760
And that was it, like keep going, you've got to keep moving, tick, tock, tick, tock, keep

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.600
walking nice and slow and relax.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600
And that was it.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.640
Did he take you up Thompson Park?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.920
We went straight for a walk up Thompson's Park and it was hilarious, crossing the crossroad,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:36.960
we felt like giraffes and zebras and he went running up the bank, the grass bank and I

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.920
was maybe not on my first go.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.440
And we did, we went for a walk.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.440
Can you remember what your first costume was then?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.440
Blimey.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.440
I can't, I can't remember.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.440
Something red and black.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.400
We'll have to have a look at the pictures and see what was the red and black in sort

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.440
of weird baskets.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.400
We'll find them, we'll find them, we'll go through them.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.160
So in terms of the different characters you played, did you have a favourite?

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.960
Which one sticks in your mind?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.040
Or do you have any affection for?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.040
I think it was 2004.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.040
There we go, spirit, spirit of Mother Earth.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.440
I went back to university after I'd come back to Cardiff and 2004 was when I graduated

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.680
so I had this weird bird, golden bird outfit that I'd made for one of my projects at uni

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.760
and I got to wear that and so that's my favourite one because I, well I got to put more time

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.280
into it because it's quite short and intense to make costume at camp isn't it?

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280
Oh God absolutely.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.280
And they're like, it's like, ah, intensive.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.280
And how about the parade days itself, what are your memories of those?

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.280
What was they like?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.280
Ah, the arriving in the morning and getting everybody ready and everybody making each

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.880
other up and everybody dressing each other and it's all massive community and bonding

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.880
and excitement and nervousness and it was wonderful.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:29.880
Really, really wonderful, spot on in terms of that heart, that community, all ages, all

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.880
the disabilities, everybody, just everybody mucking in together helping with everything.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.880
In terms of the reaction from the great unwashed Cardiff public, how do you feel they supported

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.480
the parade?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.480
Oh gosh, I remember one of them that I think camp was down at the Squaw down the bay.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:57.800
That was one of the camps I went to and the parade then went from the school, went through

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.520
the bay and then, I'm not quite sure, oh yeah then into the Oval Basin, it was quite a short

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.520
parade but it was such a boiling hot summer, it was absolutely rammed and all the people

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.920
were just packed together and it just made it feel really, really full and the response

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.720
was just lovely, really amazing.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.720
I loved that one most so it just went from the school very slow and intense and packed

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.720
and then ended up in the Basin with our dancing in the Basin.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.920
You just have a big stage and the rest of it too, even a headliner, could have been

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.920
Testament Decker, Jimmy Cliff, I mean some of the reggae.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.920
Could have been, I can't remember who, but there was that either.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.920
And the statement after the parade.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.920
Did you have to cross the stage on stilts?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:57.920
Because there were times when we put the parade over the stage and each section got announced

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.920
and applauded and things like that.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:09.120
The times that I did it was when the parade would stop in the Oval Basin was the big showpiece

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:16.120
and of course everybody was around in the Oval Basin, like that amphitheatre and there

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:25.120
was a, you know, that circle was held as the stage inside the Basin.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.120
Yes, yes, yes.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.320
Yeah, it's all coming back to me, almost as if I was there.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.320
I was, I remember that, I remember that.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.320
So you did a number of years as a stilt walker, a bit of a sad ending to this story, isn't there?

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.320
A little bit.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.320
What happened?

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:46.320
I went on holiday with an art group.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.320
We went to Krakow to see some art with all the six performers and we had a couple of

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.520
days in the mountains skiing and I had a big skiing accident, smashed my knee to bits

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:09.520
and it's too weak to stilt walk now because stilt walking is quite hard on the knees.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.520
Yeah, so I stopped and I need to donate my stilts to Swee Care.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.520
That's very sweet of you, well accept them with open arms.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.720
There's two pairs, ones that I made at college for that EMA when I was in college.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:30.720
I did D&T so I had all the tools and equipment ready there and I made them in the holidays.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720
Got it.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.720
I made peg stilts and I have some plaster stilts so I'll bring them.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.720
Wow, that's really sweet of you indeed.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:50.920
Given that we reconnected when I saw you in the sewing place around the corner, we never

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.920
changed you to a sewing machine.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.920
You escaped that fake worst of death.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.920
That's very clever of you if you don't mind me sewing so.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:08.920
Costume is what I do for a living and I think it was the best mentality.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.120
And to help with other things.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.120
Yeah, I think that's important.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:19.120
Yeah, well and you already had your staff in place with Jude and that was my year when

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.120
she was headmaker.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120
Got it.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.120
Ben and Jude, well Ben and Jude was headmasters.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.120
Do you see them when they come down?

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.120
Yeah, I saw them.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:38.120
I put blind-av on, they were up there doing some bits of projects.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.320
And Frank Clown, he was there doing his performance.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.320
I don't know if he does stuff with Sweeca.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:53.320
But Ben and Jude and Ola, their little girl.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.320
She's beautiful.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.320
And Ben is swimming the channel.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.320
In stages.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.320
Oh, it's in stages.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320
Okay.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.320
This is a Facebook chat there, isn't it?

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.520
This is the length of the channel in laps of a pool.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.520
Not in one go.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.520
Oh, it's not in the channel.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.520
No.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.520
Because that's what I thought first of all.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.520
Oh, look at me thinking.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.520
No, I thought that because I thought how very David Williams.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.520
Thinking Ironman channel swim.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.520
He's doing it over time.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.520
But it's still respectful.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.520
Respect.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.520
Absolutely.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.520
You bet.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.520
You bet.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.520
Either way, Elaine, thank you very much for your powerful memories.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.520
We shall treasure those.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.720
We shall keep them for future generations.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.720
Well, Steve, thank you so much for my carnival experiences.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.720
Thank you for the studs to come.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.720
They're coming.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.720
They're coming.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.720
They're in the garage.
