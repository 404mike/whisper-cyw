00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360
It's the 12th of June, I'm Stephanie Cruz of Ellen Lynx and I'm here today in Raider

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.160
talking to Mawver Shaw and to Jill Willie. Mawver, just for reference, in which year

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.360
were you born? 1938. And Jill? 1951. Thank you. Mawver, can you tell me a little bit

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.800
about your family and how you came to be in Raider where you were born? I was born and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.800
I was born and raised in Raider at number nine in the gardens and I was the second daughter of the family.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.800
Your father was? My father was a blacksmith and I'm not sure, I think the man was just a housewife then.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:50.800
And we lived there for a while and then I think just before the war finished, my father was a

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:59.800
moved from Raider to work at Winds, I'm not sure what it was, something to do with blacksmithing I would imagine.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.800
And we were there for a while because my brother was born in an air raid in Newport itself. Oh, right.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.800
And then the way he was, my father was working, it was bombed so we came back to Raider.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:24.800
And I think eventually, I don't know, I don't remember where we were at. Just trying to figure it out.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.800
Did you move back to Green Gardens? No, we moved back to a place called, I can't think of the name of it now.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.800
It'll come. Whereabouts was it?

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.800
I'll just up the, what I call the Pounds Lane but I can't think of the name of the farm. It came to me just before you said something.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.800
It's gone again now. Anyway, we shared a house there for a little while and then we came back to live in Raider in Penpole.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.800
Opposite to the Contaider Arms pub then, you know, the alleyway up to, you know what I mean?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800
I do Church Street.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:16.800
And then we lived there then until we were allocated the Moratie Green Gardens and that's where I stayed until I got married.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:29.800
And then we got married in 1963, like myself. And then I think it was about, Mark was six months old when we came to live here.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:40.800
And you've been here ever since? Yeah, he was born in 1965. And then three years later I had Richard and he was born in 1968.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.800
And then I went, eventually went back to the chemist after Richard went to school before.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:58.800
So if we go back a bit, you first started working at the chemists in 1955. And did you have an interview?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:09.800
Well, no, actually in one respect, yes, but no in another because I worked for one year in Central Stores, which is now the spa.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.800
She was owned by Gerald Morgan and his family. And I had worked there for a year.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.800
And then my sister, who was already working in the chemists before me for one year, was going to teach a trade in college.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.800
So T.C. Price very kindly asked her to ask me would I like the job?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:42.800
Because he thought the work I was doing at Central Stores was too much for a young woman. So that's how I came to work in the chemists.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.800
Right, okay. And Jill, your mum worked in the same chemist, didn't she?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.800
Yes, she did. Not for very long, I don't think. Probably the very late 50s, going into the early 60s.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:06.800
I know she left in 62, but she did have a few very happy years working part time, I believe it was, in the chemist shop.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.800
Yes, but not for T.C. Price. It was for E.W. Price.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.800
And what do you remember of Jill's mum?

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.800
I can't remember. I don't remember your mum that much. I mean, I remember her going, she was a W.I. member, wasn't she?

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.800
But I wasn't there, of course, because I was only a teenager then, wasn't I?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.800
So not a time for me to get under the bridge since then.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.800
So what stories do you remember your mum telling, Jill?

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.800
Well, I'll have to tell you. I'll start with a funny one anyway. No, perhaps I'd better start with a more serious one, haven't I?

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.800
I know she used to talk about the customers that came in and the sort of things they'd ask for.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.800
And they'd seem to go off at a tangent sometimes, you know, not knowing quite what it was that they wanted.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.800
I think they wanted the assistants there to sort out their problems, you know.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.800
I'm sure a lot of that used to happen. And of course, these are in the days where you didn't sort of walk around and help yourself like a supermarket.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.800
You actually went to the counter, didn't you?

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.800
And people used to come in with their problems. And I remember one lady, she was a single lady,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.800
but she obviously thought she was in the family way, which of course was a bit hush hush in those days.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:32.800
And she went up to my mother asking her if there was anything my mother could do or anything my mother could give her, you know, in these circumstances.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.800
And of course, my poor mother, well, she wasn't in any position to do that sort of thing.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.800
You know, that was a bit of a sad story.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.800
Quite hard for her.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.800
Then I remember something rather funny. There was a lady working there, who all the knew very well, called Jean Buffton.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:58.800
And she had an amazing sense of humour. And one day a customer came into the chemist saying to Jean,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.800
look, can you help me, please? I want something, a nice present for a nice little old lady.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.800
Jean sort of looked at her and said, well, how about a little old man?

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.800
I thought that was a lovely story. I still tell that one.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.800
And more for you. You've got a little black book there where something's written down in it, haven't you?

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.800
Oh, right, yes, we did, yes. We used to have a lot of fun about this. Do you want to read that one?

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.800
Yes, I'll read a few.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.800
Oh, really, about myself, because I shouldn't say it ahead of time.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:42.800
Right, it says here. This is myself now over. I went up to the cemetery last night collecting, but I didn't get an answer.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.800
And what did some people come and ask for?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:55.800
Because as Jill says, you didn't go and have a look on the shelf. You asked for certain kinds of hand cream.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.800
That's right, different ones come and ask for different things. Four years one.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.800
Somebody asked for scruples ammonia, and it should have been scrubbed ammonia. We still have that today, don't we?

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.800
We do.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.800
Oh, and another one was somebody asked, could they have some J, Jews fluid? Should have been J's fluid.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.800
J's fluid, yes, I remember that.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.800
And you were saying just earlier, going through some of the changes that you saw in the shop,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.800
you used to have to handwrite the labels for the medicines that were dispensed.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:44.800
Yes, we did. Yes, that's quite interesting. You got writers crap doing that, but of course it wasn't as busy as it got eventually, you know, with the NHS.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:08:00.800
And then we sort of progressed. And I think it was after T.C. Price retired, and even when E.W. retired, Mrs. Evans, that was another pharmacist who bought the chemists off E.W.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.800
And she had already bought a chemist off him in Willish. Oh, right.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.800
And like they followed one another really to Rairdham. She actually had retired.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:19.800
But because her son was going to university, she felt she would have to go back to work to see him through university.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:25.800
And then afterwards it didn't matter to much, she said, you know, but she was quite a character.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:32.800
And I think she had everything under the sun in the chemist then, like, you know, entirely different to E.W. and T.C. Price.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:40.800
And I can remember this is Kathleen Price now, the previous owner's wife.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.800
She said to me one day, she said, it's like a woe, she said, it's not a chemist shop.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.800
And she was quite sharp about that.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:55.800
So when you first started working at the chemist, can you describe what the shop looked like inside?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.800
It looked like it would go in through the front doors.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.800
Well, yeah, well, there's a lot of.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.800
At the back of the shop, at the back of the counter in the actual shop,

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:18.800
there were like all these drawers with all these labels on, like mothballs and, you know, varying things all in these little cupboards behind you.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.800
And then there were shelves above with all these carboys and things, you know.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.800
And I remember one day we had to dust the top shelves.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:35.800
I can remember T.C. Price saying to me, Maverick, don't take the top off that ammonia because it'll take your head off.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.800
You said if you must have, of course I did, didn't I?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.800
Then you came down the ladder.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800
I love you.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.800
Thanks, we don't.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.800
Yeah. And do you remember the shop as it was like that?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:54.800
Yes, I do. I remember cupboards full of jars of these very interesting looking medicines.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:01.800
I remember that. And I remember there was like a little almost like an ante room which had baby food.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.800
I remember the shelves behind shelves sort of thing.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.800
And then there was one completely full room baby food.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:16.800
I remember. And of course, then you had the other things on display, like nice perfumes and nice talcum powders and soaps.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.800
And perhaps something for the little old lady is what that lady I think was really talking about.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:29.800
Yes, and if I can just mention, my father had a very good friendship with Mr. T.C. Price.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:39.800
And I remember being literally in the back behind the scenes trying on pairs of glasses with my father and Mr. Price.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.800
Because he was an optometrist as well.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800
That's right, yeah.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:49.800
And some of his younger family, you know, we'd get together and try on lipsticks, Dorothy Gray particularly.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.800
We thought we were very, very sophisticated.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.800
But all this was going on sort of behind the scenes as it were.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:01.800
I don't remember, for instance, glasses or an awful lot of makeup actually on display.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:09.800
Yes, I certainly remember it. And of course, the big difference being that you went up to the counter to...

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.800
And T.C. Price used to make concoctions for the farmers.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.800
And he had a lovely, like, what do they call it?

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.800
A book that he kept them in, you know, he wrote the recipes in.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.800
Beautiful handwriting he did.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.800
But I don't know where that chronicle went.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800
It was certainly in the chemist's...

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:40.800
After Mrs. Evans left and then Mr. Ken Evans, he came.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.800
No, Edward, sorry, not Evans, sorry. Mr. Edwards came.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.800
And when they left, I think they took it with them.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.800
You know, I've got a feeling that they loved it.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.800
It was a shame because you shouldn't have been left really there.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.800
And so that was for the animals?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.800
Yes.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.800
Yes.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.800
Well, I'll tell you what it is.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.800
We used to sit out the back.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.800
There was like a lean-to at the back and then one sat up like today sort of thing.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.800
And we'd mix this concoction up in a big bucket.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.800
And if the wind was in the right direction, we would take your breath away.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.800
And it was what we called a green salve.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.800
And I remember this one day, saying to Mr. Price, well, what exactly is that for?

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.800
Well, it's something they put on the little slabs when they were castrated.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.800
I thought, poor little things.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.800
Do you remember what was in it?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.800
Oh, no. I can't remember now. That's so many years ago.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.800
I mean, that stopped a long time ago.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.800
But you have a memory of...

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.800
I do have a memory of the medicines that he used to make.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.800
And there was a couple of things he'd make, which is supposedly to cure a cold.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.800
I think they were like a general antidote, really.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.800
One was pink and one was white.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.800
And he claimed that one was vanilla and one was strawberry.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.800
And if you took this, you'd be fixed up.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:14.800
Well, the taste of these was so absolutely ghastly that the very thought of taking it instantly cured you.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.800
I'm sure it was psychological.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.800
But I'll never forget those.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.800
And the very thought, you knew he was disappearing out the back to make these concoctions.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.800
And I thought, oh, no, here we go.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.800
Oh, gosh. Oh, for goodness sake.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.800
Oh, look, a bottle.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.800
One of the bottles out.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.800
Those were the bottles.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.800
Glass bottle and stopper and...

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.800
A jar.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.800
There's some more there.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.800
Was the green salve kept in that jar?

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.800
No, no, no. That was for other things.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.800
I see.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.800
There's no label on it.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.800
There needs to be a label on it, but there's another small...

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.800
Oh, that's a label on that one.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.800
No, there's not been a label.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.800
Pil-hydra.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.800
I don't know what that is.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.800
I mean, that's a pass.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.800
Jill, can you pass me the step up by you there?

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.800
The step, certainly.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.800
Just chuck that on the floor.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.800
And the glass bottle is labelled salt-tri-pan blue.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.800
One gram with a squiggle there that I can't...

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.800
You need a promise.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.800
Yes, we need a promise.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.800
It's like they used to make up medicines, you know, didn't they?

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.800
Absolutely.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.800
And notice telephone number 45.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.800
Yeah, but it's... What is it now?

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.800
It's probably something similar.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.800
810...

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.800
145, perhaps.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.800
It's 445, isn't it?

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.800
810-445.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.800
And I think it remains so now to this day.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.800
Probably.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.800
Oh, look, more bottles, I remember.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.800
These are all bottles.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:08.800
Yes, another with a TC Price label on it.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.800
Raider.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.800
A struggle is out here.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.800
Oh, that's another lovely one.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.800
Spirit of Cantha.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.800
Well, the shape of these bottles, they're absolutely beautiful.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.800
They are, aren't they?

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.800
They're ornamental in themselves now.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.800
Can I have...

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.800
And a blue one.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.800
Now, that one is denoting that that's poisonous, is that right?

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.800
Yes, that's right.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.800
Because it's got...

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.800
Well, A, it's got a little bit of a...

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.800
Because it's got...

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.800
Well, A, it's got not to be taken...

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.800
Blues and browns, you know.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.800
Brown, especially, where the poisonous ones.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.800
Mm-hmm.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.800
And the ribbing on the bottles as well, that's...

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.800
I don't know if that was...

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.800
Yeah, just to show you the difference of the bottles.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.800
I had thought that it was so that you didn't take it by accident at night.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.800
Don't look at the dachshund.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.800
So you could feel that it's got that thing on.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.800
And you knew that you shouldn't take it.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.800
Perhaps somebody...

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.800
Do you know, I haven't realised I had so many of these left.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.800
Perhaps somebody with poor eyesight.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.800
Mm-hmm.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.800
They would rely on the tactile nature.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.800
That's the dropper, look.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.800
Yes, gosh, yes.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.800
Eye drops or ear drops, so it could be iodine.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.800
You can't buy iodine today, now, can you?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.800
I've no idea, haven't tried.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.800
Isn't it betadine that we take now, and it doesn't hurt as much?

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.800
Oh, I don't know.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.800
But I remember iodine.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.800
Ouch.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.800
Yes, it was quite painful.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.800
The manganate of potash my grandmother used as well.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.800
Oh, yes, yeah.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.800
There you go.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:52.800
So going back to the chemist then, obviously there were quite a lot of changes over your time there.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.800
We've talked a little bit about labels.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.800
And technology changed quite a lot as well.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.800
Or maybe, let's go back to...

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.800
When you first worked there, did Mr Price have a telephone?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.800
Yes, yes he did.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.800
I used to be really nervous of answering it.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.800
But he made you do it, you know.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.800
He used to say, you know, you'll get used to it, and you did.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.800
And did people ring up to say that there'd been an emergency or an accident or something?

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.800
No, I don't remember much about that.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.800
I don't think so.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.800
I don't really, we used to deal with oxygen.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.800
Being oxygen-cylinders.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.800
And if somebody needed oxygen at home,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:40.800
T.C. Price would connect it up and, you know, take it forward to get it delivered to them.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.800
Did he have a delivery van?

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.800
No, no. T.C. Price didn't drive.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.800
He and his wife used to cycle a lot.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.800
They used to go cycling always on a Thursday afternoon up around the valley and something like that.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.800
Taking photographs.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.800
Yeah, so he's probably got a good collection.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.800
So, yes, so to move on, after handwriting the labels,

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.800
technology has obviously progressed to computers.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.800
Yes, that's right, yeah.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.800
What do you remember of those coming in?

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.800
I don't remember.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.800
That's the first time I had any dealing with a computer was with Mrs. Evans.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.800
And she was the next pharmacist after E.W. Price.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.800
And she said, we're going to have a computer over.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.800
And I thought, oh, well.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:35.800
So she said, hopefully we'll have all our patients down in the computer program

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.800
and, you know, we'll do the labeling from that.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.800
And she's got it all sussed out now nicely and we're having a bit of a practice.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.800
And I've got a few trial and errors, I think.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.800
But she said this one day,

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.800
Mother, whatever you do, don't touch that button there.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.800
But we're terrified because she said if you did, if you just did that,

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.800
it would take the whole system out.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800
Oh, gosh.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.800
You know, it has to start again.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.800
But, you know, eventually we got to your suite.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.800
It did save a lot of work with the labeling.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.800
Yes, yes.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.800
And do you remember what it looked like?

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.800
Oh, a very small, very small little contraption to start.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:27.800
But once I think it was we had it with Ken Edwards.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.800
He was there. He had the computer.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.800
That was all right.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:38.800
But once he left and he sold his business to now the German company, which still Phoenix.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.800
That's all you got.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.800
I couldn't think of the name of it.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.800
They still, and they're rolling the company, which I knew.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.800
So and this one day, the traffic came in and he said, right, he said,

00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.800
you've got two hours now, he said, we're going to put the new computer in and the system.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:09.800
It was all attached to the phone and anything you want when you sort of doing your labels,

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:16.800
you can press a button and enter it and it would record it to order for the following day or whatever.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.800
And that took quite a bit of getting used to.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800
But we managed.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.800
At any rate, he said, right, Ducky, he said, we finished now.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.800
He said, we're off.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.800
I said, you said two hours.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.800
They'd been there an hour.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.800
And I said, oh dear.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.800
But at any rate, we managed.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.800
It was a lot of trial and error to start, but it was, you know, a really good system.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:45.800
So until I left, I, you know, I quite enjoyed that, but I never want to see a computer after.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.800
But then he says, we haven't got a computer.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.800
And I said, no, sorry.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.800
Was that after the shop had moved to the?

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.800
No, no, no.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.800
I'm trying to think how long it is since they moved.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.800
Where's my, that's my little book.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.800
Trouble is I didn't put the date on it.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.800
No.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.800
And Jill, you say your mum wasn't there very long.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.800
Do you remember any of the other ladies who worked in the shop?

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.800
Presumably it was all just ladies.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.800
No, I only remember Pridwyn Morver and this Jean Buffton.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.800
I do remember that, yes.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.800
And Pridwyn was?

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.800
Pridwyn was Pridwyn Jones, I believe.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.800
Yes, she was.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.800
Living at the Nile.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.800
Yes, right.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.800
In the Nile bungalow, which has recently been demolished.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.800
Married Amaris Price.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.800
Yes, ma'am.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.800
Yeah, Prid's sadly passed away.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:51.800
So I reckon it must have been, I worked there, the last part of my work there was from 1972 to 2006 when I retired.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.800
So I would say, how long was the house used?

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.800
I started coming here regularly, I think, in 2007.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:07.800
And I'm fairly sure it was established in the old Hughes then.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.800
It's either 2007 or 2008, isn't it? 2006, 2007.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.800
Around that time, I would say.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.800
Well, I think it's near 2006, perhaps.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.800
But I can't absolutely be sure.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.800
No, no, that's fine. Just out of curiosity, really.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.800
Because do you know why they moved? Why they came out of this one?

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.800
I don't know. I think they didn't want to expand, actually.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.800
A bigger premise, is that a thing?

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.800
Yes, because it was getting down.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.800
Because there was Brighuie Home and Crossfield House, home here.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:47.800
They were doing a lot of medication for the patients there.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:57.800
And we were also doing what we call units of medication in lots.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:06.800
You know, lots of breakfast, lunch, dinner, night time, that sort of thing.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.800
And the tablets and things like that.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.800
And we had to do that as well.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.800
So it was quite a lot of work, really.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.800
Not just counting the tablets, it was putting them in these containers,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.800
sealing them down.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.800
But it was quite interesting, you know, a lot of hard work.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.800
You had to have them all ready for, you know, in weekly succession.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.800
So it was quite good.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.800
So after 30 years of working there, who were your colleagues,

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.800
who else was working there when you left?

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.800
I'm just trying to think. That was the last one I left with her.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:53.800
That's the first, how shall I say, that's the first bus in that Rolandsted.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.800
They refurbished where the health food place is now.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.800
That's in the blue.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.800
And then that's again in the green.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.800
That's when I retired.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.800
Well, at my...

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.800
Oh, I was trying to think.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.800
Oh, this is the leaving party episode.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.800
This is Catherine Joy, Dr. Joy's daughter.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.800
Julia Smith.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.800
Mike, my husband.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.800
Mike, my husband, and Mr. R. Owens are the pharmacists.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.800
And then I worked with Zoe.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.800
She still works in the chemist now, you know, the one where we moved to.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.800
But I think that must be...

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:59.800
That must be where the Rolandsted now is left, I think.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:05.800
It looks like that back shelf, yes, next to the counter there, yes.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.800
That would definitely be the...

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.800
Yeah, that says 16th of the 3rd, 2007.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.800
Right.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.800
And it was a red nose day.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:28.800
So it's all my working life in chemists from January 1955 to July 1965,

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:34.800
then from 1972 to 2006, when I finally retired.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.800
Worked for T.C. Price Pharmacists and Optician,

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.800
Mr. E.W. Price Pharmacists, Mrs. Muriel Evans Pharmacists,

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.800
Mr. Ken Edwards Pharmacists, all privately owned,

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.800
then sold to London to L. Rowland and Company Limited,

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.800
and later taken over by Phoenix Germany Company,

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.800
but still retained L. Rowland and Company Limited.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.800
That's it.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.800
Oh, and it says amongst the photographs are some of the girls I worked with.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.800
Gina Golmer, Susan Saunders, Anne Cadwallader, Christine Drew,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.800
Shirley Barrywater, Anne Phillips, to name those not in the photo album.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.800
Right.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.800
That's a lovely, lovely thing.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:23.800
And the picture that you were given as a leaving present, what was that of?

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.800
That's what they call the old swan.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.800
Can I have a look? Can I have a look at the one in the syndrome?

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.800
It's a lovely one. Oh, sorry.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.800
No, it's all right. We'll have a look later.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.800
There's that photograph. I was looking for it.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.800
Oh, right, right.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.800
It's right in the front of that. Sorry.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.800
So, Myra Scott and Heather Jones, so that's your elder sister.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:49.800
1954. Just does loads of stuff on the shelves.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.800
Oh, yes. I think I remember it looking like that, yes.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.800
That's a young girl.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.800
And NHS, I noticed, so that would have been, well, obviously after 1947.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.800
That's right.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.800
That's when it was all...

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.800
Like all the, at the back of the counter as you walked in,

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.800
there was all these, as you say, like mahogany counters and that, wasn't it?

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.800
Oh, they were beautiful.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.800
Yeah, it was lovely.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.800
Or cabinets and counters. I do remember that, yes.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.800
Yeah, with like elegant sort of brass handles.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.800
Yeah.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.800
Can I see the date on it?

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.800
That one's 1955.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.800
That's me, that is. That's the year I started.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.800
My father died in the January of that year.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.800
And then I worked then from...

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.800
How did he die?

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.800
He died of cancer.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.800
Oh, bless. Smoker?

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.800
Quite young, really. There we are.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.800
Yeah. Yes. So, yes, it looks a fascinating shop.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.800
Yeah, it was very...

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.800
And of course, we changed the uniform and everything over the years.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.800
But mostly white. I like the white overall.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.800
White you had to keep them clean or else you were in trouble.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.800
I remember my mother in those white overalls.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.800
Yes, you're quite right.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.800
And one of the posters that you've got up in the shop is a castle cinema ballroom.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.800
That's right, yeah. Well, that's where Lost Ark is down.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.800
Yes, yes. So that's 1955. You're having a whist drive and a dance.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.800
That's right. You just have lots of those.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.800
And you just have St. Thomas Hall, didn't they?

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.800
Yes, I believe so, yes, which is sort of now the leisure centre.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.800
So if I can just ask, did...

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.800
T.C. Price didn't mind sort of advertisements for local...

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.800
No, he didn't mind that. He didn't mind at all.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.800
No, he was very good with that.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.800
And, you know, over the years he belonged to the Red Chamber of Trade.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:52.800
I think he and Richard Hughes' father and Mr. Harold Ryder,

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.800
I think they were all belonged to the Chamber of Trade.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.800
Yes, very probable.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.800
And I think it was finished before I...

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.800
Well, they were all business people in the town, weren't they?

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.800
That's right.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.800
Yeah, so it did look quite different, much lighter.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.800
Yes, that's right.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.800
Much more space. Fascinating.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:19.800
So what other changes in Raider have you seen over your lifetime here?

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.800
Oh, quite a lot, really.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.800
We've lost a lot of shops, haven't we, over the years, sort of thing.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.800
They seem to change all the time.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.800
Almost every time I was coming back before I came to Livy permanently,

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.800
a shop would have changed hands, and it's happening still.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.800
You know, something will close down and then something else will pop up.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.800
Of course, it's the traffic, isn't it, that's really changed so much.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:52.800
Yeah, but you know, how shall we say, we're in the North Street now, aren't we?

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.800
No, West Street, that's right.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.800
Well, at the bottom end, you know where the Butcher's shop is now?

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.800
Bobby the Butcher's, as we call it, well, that's changed to another.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.800
That used to be Walton's shop there, a television shop.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.800
This used to sell, you know, all sorts of things there.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.800
Then next door to that, I'm trying to think now, what was there?

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.800
I seem to remember, was there an ice cream shop there, near the Beehive,

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.800
and there was Dyboot and his...

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.800
Yeah, you've gone off a bit too far.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.800
Am I going too far to the clock now?

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:30.800
There was a Mrs. Harris's, I think, in the shop where the Antiques shop is now.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.800
And I'm trying to think who was in the shop.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:38.800
Oh, I tell you, it was in the shop next, between the Butcher and the Antiques shop,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.800
it was a Mrs. Mills with the wool shop.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.800
But I remember buying wool from there, because I'm a right knitter.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.800
Yes.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.800
And then, I'm trying to think now, what else?

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.800
And there used to be a...

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.800
like a cafe.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.800
Next door to Dyboot, years ago.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.800
Was it the West End?

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.800
I remember that.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.800
I seem to remember it was something to do with ice cream, on the West End.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.800
And then, of course, it's always been...

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:19.800
where the kebab shop is now, used to be the men's department for Richard Hughes, wasn't it?

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.800
I believe it was.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:28.800
And then the other half, the other part of the shop, the main big shop, was ladies' clothing, wasn't it?

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.800
It was, and it was the most amazing shaped shop.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.800
Yes, yes.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.800
It had like an arcades.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.800
You went in one way around.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.800
And the display windows seemed to be on an angle.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.800
That's right.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.800
And you walked in, and there was like an awning over them.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.800
And again, a very, very old fashioned shop.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.800
You'd expect the change to be humming on wires.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.800
I don't know whether they did that at any stage.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.800
And again, like you mentioned, everything was in little drawers.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.800
Everything of drawer was pulled out, you know, cardigans, jumpers, etc.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.800
That's right, yeah.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.800
Yes, I do remember.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.800
And where are we?

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.800
Then there's a lyre.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.800
Then there was where the...

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.800
oh, what do you call it?

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.800
The real estate.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.800
Community.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.800
Oh, yes.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.800
That was the post office, the Crown post office.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.800
That's right.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.800
That was lovely.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.800
And I can remember, I can't remember the name of the people that got it from,

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.800
but they came there to run it.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.800
And they'd got a dog, a boxer dog.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.800
And Bart went to, I don't know whether he went to help sort out posts or what he was doing,

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.800
but this dog used to love polar mints.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.800
Not Harvey Pugh, was it?

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.800
He was there at some stage, wasn't he?

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.800
Yeah, but that was a Crown post office.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.800
Yeah, that's right, he was.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:33:00.800
And then on the corner, where the estate agent is now,

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.800
which was the Air Ambulance shop for a while,

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:11.800
Val Evans and Inwill Evans, his mother, had a grocery shop and a sweet shop there.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.800
I remember that, yes.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.800
That's been many things on the corner.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.800
And then where Holton's Fish and Chip shop is now,

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:24.800
Mrs. Evans also had a sweet shop there years ago,

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.800
before she moved to the corner.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.800
I can remember that as a kid.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.800
Yes, everybody moves, don't they?

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.800
They set up somewhere else.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.800
Yes.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:41.800
I can remember Dr. Poole used to live, had his surgery at home at Brinkoid,

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:50.800
by the car park, and they used to take maternity patients in, didn't they?

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.800
Yes, yes, several people.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.800
Yes, we used to go there.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.800
Well, we were actually four there, yes.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.800
And they used to keep goats.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.800
And if these goats got out, they'd chase you, you know.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.800
And I can remember going down to the dark place,

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.800
we were terrified that these goats might be out.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.800
And I remember this one day, this one was out.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.800
When I took off down the road with him behind me,

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.800
and I dashed into Mrs. Evans's sweet shop, and they go after me.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.800
Oh, I don't think that's an element of the chemist, but never mind.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.800
Just memories of growing up.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.800
It doesn't happen these days.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.800
The name of the farm was Dolvea.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.800
That's where we stayed, a little farmhouse.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.800
So we shared the house with another family.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:40.800
I can remember my mother, the other lady that lived there,

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.800
they used to cycle to town for milk, you know, every so often.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.800
They'd take it in turns to do that.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.800
So we certainly moved around.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.800
Dolvea, did you say?

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.800
B-Y-R?

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.800
D-O-L.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.800
F-I-R, I think it did.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.800
Well, we look at it on the map anyway.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.800
Dolvea, it is, yeah.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.800
Down the Pound Lane, was it?

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.800
Yeah, you can go in from the main road and turn by...

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.800
Down towards Teylettice there.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.800
That's right, yeah, you turn up the lane there.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800
We find it on the map.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.800
I don't remember living there.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.800
I was only a little kid, I expect.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.800
What do you remember of school?

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.800
I can't remember a lot of it.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.800
I know I went to Cuntighver School.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.800
And the only thing I can really remember of Cuntighver School,

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.800
that on your birthday, whoever was in the class had a birthday

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.800
the same day as you.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.800
You had to sit on a chair with them,

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.800
and there was a lantern down Cuntighver somewhere,

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.800
and he sat by my side, and I wasn't very pleased.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.800
I don't know why.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.800
There we are.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.800
That's all I can remember about Cuntighver School.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.800
Then I went to Reader School.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.800
And I think I was taught by...

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.800
Mr. Price.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.800
Miss Farmer.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.800
And Mrs. Owen.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.800
She used to live at Glance Earth, or she left,

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.800
she was at Glance Earth, but she was on Glyfran before that.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.800
I can remember that.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.800
I don't remember.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.800
Oh, and Miss Farmer.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.800
If you didn't bring your sewing to school,

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.800
which they did sewing in those days, you know, embroidery,

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.800
she'd make you down her brother's socks.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.800
I'm quite a good downer, actually.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.800
Oh, well.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.800
And is that where you got interested in knitting?

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.800
No, I think my mother taught me to knit.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.800
And I think I got...

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.800
Jennifer's a good bit younger than me, my younger sister.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.800
I used to knit for our dresser dolls.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.800
So that's how I came about it.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.800
But I still do knit, you know.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.800
I just finished a show now.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.800
You are a wonderful knitter.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:14.800
You know, I made a real mess up of that, because not mess up.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:19.800
I was counting the amounts, I suppose I had 143 patterns on this show.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.800
And I think I've done about 50 too many.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.800
That's all I do.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.800
I don't want to do that.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.800
You've won so many prizes in shows and competitions, haven't you?

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.800
Absolutely wonderful.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.800
Do you want to see the one I do?

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.800
In a minute.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.800
Lovely.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.800
So is there anything else that you can remember about the chemists?

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.800
Just try to think of them.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.800
What did you say?

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.800
After you've gone, I've also been thinking all sorts of things.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.800
You've jotted it down, haven't you?

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.800
Okay.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.800
Well, thank you both very much.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.800
It's been fascinating talking to you.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.800
And I'm very, very grateful.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.800
Have a lovely afternoon.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.800
We certainly have.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.800
Bye-bye.
