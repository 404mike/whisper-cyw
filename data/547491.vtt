00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Lord, say, on this, thy youth arose, A ghost that sometime undergrews,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Where door of hell will make his choir, A choir leadeth round them by.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:58.000
O God, now hear, O reek of Thew, My life in prouder arm'ry too,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Where breast and throng of Bethlehem breath, My iniquity thou alone o'ergave o'er them.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Thou name and fear of my accord, Thou God, now and by my Lord,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Thou ne'er brought home to my well-dear, My name I'll call upon, O God, my name.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Thee alone I'll be there by his side, And where he's done in person more,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Thee alone I'll be there by his side, And where he's done in person more,
