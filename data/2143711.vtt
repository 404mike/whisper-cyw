00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
But the difficult part was to hear your own family. My children, I can only, I've always

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:19.920
called them my children, I can't help it. My children never cried unless they were hungry.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:29.400
And when they cried they were hungry. I couldn't tolerate this. So after a while I went to the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:48.120
superintendent. I must explain first that I had long blonde plaits and blue eyes. My

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:57.960
brother also was fair. We didn't look very Jewish. And I decided that we were going shopping.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.480
So I went to the superintendent and said, please can I have some money? I wanted to know why. I

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:16.480
said my children are hungry. I want to go shopping. So we did. We went to different parts of town.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.480
Because normally we weren't allowed out of the orphanage gates. We went to different parts of

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:33.560
town and we shopped. And the two little children with an enormous basket full of necessities of

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:42.640
life. And we knew the necessities. And we got away with it for about two months. And we suddenly

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:51.680
found we were followed by Nazi youths. And they caught us one day and beat us and took our basket.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.200
And literally threw us into the gates of the orphanage and called us all the vile names they

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:09.200
could lay tongue to. And the superintendent said, you know, that's it, no more. For a while that was

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:19.040
it, no more. Until I could no longer bear to hear my children cry. I went to the superintendent.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.400
Excuse me.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.840
And I said, please can I have some money?

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.040
Oh, she said, not going out again. I said, if you don't give me money, I will steal it.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.040
I was a very obstinate child and I still am. She looked me straight behind and said,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.120
I believe you would. She gave me money. We went out to the little gate on the other side.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.760
But we didn't get away with it for very long.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.240
After a few weeks somebody must have followed us again. This time we were caught by the Gestapo

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:23.120
and beaten with truncheons. Sorry. My brother was eight and I was nine.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.960
And ever since I've had 240 kidneys,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.720
we've been TEACHED that

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:51.120
grown men who age of nine years, and the symptoms of blood abscess,
