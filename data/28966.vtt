00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
A short history of Glyncorrug. In the early 1800s, Glyncorrug was nothing

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.600
more than a scattered community of farms and cottages. It is the only site in the

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.000
Avon Valley that appears on early maps, although the rest of the valley was

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.460
similarly populated. The arrival of the South Wales Mineral Railway in 1863,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.380
which linked Glyncorrug to Britain Ferry, was the catalyst responsible for an

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.680
increase in the population of the Upper Avon. In 1861, there were around 330

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.080
people living in the area. Glyncorrug was the first of the Avon valleys to be

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.200
developed, with Camer, Aber Gwynfie and Blaen Gwynfie following shortly after.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.140
The ordinance survey maps of 1876 show the progress of each of the four

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.760
villages. A fair indication of how the populations had increased was the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.040
introduction of public amenities. By 1900, the population of Glyncorrug had

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.520
grown to almost the size it is today, with the population standing at around

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.960
By 1951, the population had increased to 1,757.
