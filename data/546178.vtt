00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
The

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.260
The

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.260
The

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.260
The

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
The

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.260
The

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.260
The

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
The

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.260
The

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.260
The

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.260
The

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.260
The

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.760
of the common well.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.740
It came upon a hill and hill, that glorious song of old.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.220
The angels will bring near the earth,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.700
to judge their hearts of gold.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.220
Peace on the earth, good will to men,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.420
from heavens our patience be.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.620
The rolling song of stillness lay,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.460
to hear the angels sing.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.660
Verse two.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.260
Still through the golden skies they come,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.700
with peaceful winds on ground.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.380
And still their heavenly music flows,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.220
for all your weary world.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.740
A loving sound and holy praise,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.260
in them the glory weep.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.780
And evermore its mellow sounds,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.100
of verse the angels sing.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.300
Now let me ask you, are you ready to do this in Welsh?

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.780
Yes?

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.900
All right, all right.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.660
Choir, everybody on the Welsh verse.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.020
Verse first.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.700
A god and host and me are kind,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.900
a god and all I need.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.580
In the return I'm going to find,

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.100
a god and all I need.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.540
And through the meadow the world will stop,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.060
till long I'll bring it back.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:23.060
A god and host is come with us.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.580
A god and host render health.
