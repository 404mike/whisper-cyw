00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is chapter 14 in our series of short pieces covering 1918-1919, the race riots in Wales and the events that affected it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Chapter 14, 1918, setting the tone. A taste of things to come for black people.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now black and minority ethnic regions of the British Empire, the countries and people involved in World War I.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now Barbados put £100,000 in cash and the rest of the West Indian colonies £2 million towards the war effort in the First World War.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
India, 200 million. 1.3 million Indians served in World War I.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's important to remember we're talking India then, so that would now include what we see as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Goa.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The Indians were mainly front line troops, at least 74,000 died.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Africans, 135,000 front line troops. Nearly 1.5 million served as labour and auxiliary support.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now Britain was unwilling to use Muslim colonies, but France had a force noire, which was made up of several thousand Somalis and West Africans from their colonies, their empire.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The contribution of British born, of British based black people, is often understated.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Excuse me, for example Walter Tull is often mentioned, but there were many, many others who signed up for local regiments and who were never officers.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.000
For example, Toma Roma, who served in the Cheshire Regiment and the Merchant Navy, despite being diagnosed in 1915 as medically unfit.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In 1914, a third of Merchant Navy crews were non-British born.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
By 1915, that number had increased significantly as white sailors joined the Royal Navy.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But the events in 1918 showed the nature of things to come for black people involved in the war effort.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Thousands of West Indians volunteered. Their initial journey to England was perilous, with hundreds of soldiers suffering from severe frostbite when their ships were diverted via Halifax in Canada.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Very many had to return home, no longer to fit to serve as soldiers with no compensation or benefits.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Although black West Indians did fight in Egypt, France, Italy and Palestine, Mesopotamia, which is now Iraq and Jordan, but generally their main role was as labour.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:19.000
They had to load and unload ships, do labour fatigues, manual or menial labour, and perform demeaning tasks like building and cleaning toilets for white soldiers and Italian prisoners.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Which all caused much resentment. This was to come to a head in a camp at Taranto, Italy.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The attitude of white soldiers was very apparent in an incident in Belmont Road Military Hospital in Liverpool.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
About 50 of the 2,000 wounded soldiers based there were black.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Relations between the patients was quite good until white soldiers who had served in South Africa arrived in September 1918.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Tensions quickly emerged and a pitched battle occurred when 500 white soldiers attacked the 50 black servicemen with sticks, pots, pans and kettles.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Some of the other white patients tried to defend their black comrades until the military police arrived.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
The next day the London press firmly placed a blame for the offence upon the black patients.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Although later a war office inquiry found quite the opposite.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
One Trinidadian soldier in Egypt wrote to a friend saying that,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:41.000
We had treated neither as Christians nor as British citizens but as West Indians and we chose not to use this word, the N-word, without anybody to be interested in nor look after us.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:56.000
In 1999, Eugène Clark, age 106, who fought in the Somme, was nominated for the Légion d'honneur by the French government for his service on French soil.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
As a Taranto mutineer he received no recognition from Britain.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
For some black soldiers wartime experience sparked off a desire for social justice.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:18.000
After Clenol Wickham returned home he became editor of the Barbados Herald which backed early campaigns for civil rights in the West Indies.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000
The experience of these soldiers and forcefully repatriated merchant seamen was greatly to affect the fight for independence.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:39.000
The army command's handling of their black volunteers from the West Indies reveals some of the most grotesque racial attitudes ever seen in the British forces.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:56.000
When the army finally allowed the formation of a black regiment it was not allowed to fight on the Western Front because of a fear that the Germans might despise the British for needing the help of, quote, savages to wage their war.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
But they were happy to allocate the black soldiers their traditional role as servants.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
This was lethal servitude.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
The men had the task of carrying ammunition and water under heavy fire to the troops on the front lines.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:22.000
In the camp in Taranto, Italy, the West Indian soldiers were living and working in terrible conditions, shaving their bodily hair because of lice.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:36.000
At the camp the black soldiers had been denied the six pence pay rise given to whites and they were ordered to clean the latrines of their fellow white soldiers and Italian prisoners.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:51.000
They were also refused passes to leave the camp and while white soldiers were rapidly demobbed they were vindictively kept on for months, virtual prisoners, until November 1919.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000
On the 6th of November 1919 the men on the 9th battalion revolted and attacked their black officers.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:17.000
On the same day 180 sergeants forwarded a petition to the Secretary of State complaining about the pay issue, the failure to increase their separation allowance and the fact they had been discriminated against in the areas of promotion.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:28.000
This was because they had discovered that the white soldiers had been given a pay rise and they had been denied it because they were savages.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
They refused to work for four days.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
One black soldier was shot, by mistake it is stated, by a non-commissioned officer.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The new commanding officer, a South African, put down the mutiny with the battalion of Worcestershire Regiment and perceived ringleaders were rounded up.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000
The 9th British West Indies Regiment was disbanded and the men distributed to the other battalions which all subsequently disarmed.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Some of the mutineers were given prison terms of 8 to 14 years.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000
One was shot by firing squad even though the offence occurred months after the end of the war.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Under government orders there were no West Indian or African troops included in the Peace March of July 1919, a victory parade held in London to mark the end of the war.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
There is a painting that shows Indian cavalry on the march but in fact they trooped later in a separate event.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
This was supposed to be a small representative contingent of the Indian Army.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So the experience of black people in the war, particularly the soldiers, was shameful, discriminatory, extremely racist.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And it set a tone for soldiers' attitudes towards them, white soldiers' attitudes, and black soldiers' and seamen's attitudes towards A. the Empire and B. to white people in authority when they re-hearned home to the West Indies.
