00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
And did you get married while you were working there or did you...

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.600
Yes.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.600
Right.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.600
That's another story.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.600
Oh, maybe have that, maybe hear that.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:27.600
Well, when we got engaged, my parents booked a wedding for us in London for the August.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.200
This was all in the June.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:42.600
And Ivo, in the meantime, was ordered to go abroad.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:53.600
Firstly, he was ordered to leave Bletchley and go up north somewhere.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:08.600
And whilst he was there, he was told he was going to have a vacation leave because he was going abroad.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:17.600
And one day he ran to tell me that this was to happen.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:27.600
And he said, what should we do?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:39.600
We can either get married now or wait if you'd rather, we'll wait till the war's over.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.600
And I said, no, we'll get married now.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.600
So we had to get married by special license.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:02:01.600
And I had, because I was under 21, I had to have my parents' permission to do so.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.600
And that's what we did.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:22.600
We, my mother, father, my sister, Muriel, and I, we travelled to Cardiff.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:34.600
And from Bletchley we had to change at London Paddington.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:52.600
And my father was to be dropped off by a taxi to pick up from the bank the paperwork that was necessary.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:02.600
And Muriel and my mum and I went on in the taxi to Paddington.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:11.600
And my father was in another taxi to see about the license.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:21.600
And whilst he was in the taxi there was a bomb's warning.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:33.600
And he had to get out of the taxi and sort of go underneath to hide from the bombing.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:42.600
And then we travelled to Cardiff and got married.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:57.600
Then, and two weeks later, Ivo went, he left.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.600
Do you know where he went?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.600
Obviously at the time you probably didn't.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.600
We didn't know then, but he went to Italy.
