Actually, it isn't a reading in Welsh. It is by a Welshman, however, Dylan Thomas.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.600
I know a few of you have been up to Vancouver, and you've probably heard me reading this poem before.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.200
But unfortunately, I'm getting older and I need glasses, and I didn't bring them with me tonight,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.400
so it's about the only poem that I know fairly well without glasses.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.800
LAUGHTER

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.400
This poem is about a little farm in West Wales called Fernhill.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.800
It was a farm where Dylan's aunt and uncle, aunt Anna, lived.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.400
And as a boy, he would go to the farm and play with the cattle and the animals around the farm.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.800
And this is a recollection of his childhood in Fernhill.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.600
Now, as I was young and easy under the apple boughs,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.400
About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.200
The night above the dingle starry,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.200
Time let me tail and climb golden in the hay days with eyes,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.600
And honoured among my wagons I was prince of the apple towns,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.600
And once below a time I laudly had the trees and leaves trail

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.000
With daisies and barley down the rivers of the windfall light.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.400
And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.000
About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.400
In the sun that is young once only,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.800
Time let me play and be golden in the mercy of his means,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.000
And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.800
The calf sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.600
And the sabbath rang slowly in the pebbles of the holy streams.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.400
All the sun long it was running, it was lovely,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.200
The hay fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.000
It was air and playing lovely and watery, and fire green as grass.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.400
And nightly under the simple stars as I rode to sleep,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.400
The owls were bearing the farm away.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.800
All the moon long I heard blessed among stables,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.400
The night jars flying with the ricks,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.400
And the horses flashing into the dark.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.400
And then to awake, and the farm like a wanderer,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.400
The white with the dew come back, the cock on his shoulder,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.800
It was all shining, it was Adam and Maiden,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.000
The sky gathered again and the sun grew round that very day.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.800
So it must have been after the birth of the simple light

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.400
In the first spinning place,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.800
The spellbound horses walking warm out of the winnie and green stable,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.800
Onto the fields of praise.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.800
And honoured among fat foxes and pheasants by the gay house

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.800
Under the new May clouds, and happy as the heart was long,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.200
In the sun born over and over I ran my heedless ways.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.600
My wishes raced through the house high hay,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.600
And nothing I cared that my sky blue trades,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.200
That time allows in all his tuneful turning,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.800
So few and such mourning songs,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.800
Before the children green and golden follow him out of grace.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.200
Nothing I cared in those lamb white days

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.600
That time would take me up to the swallowed thronged loft

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.200
By the shadow of my hand in the moon that is always rising,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.600
Nor that riding to sleep I should hear him fly with the high fields,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.600
And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.800
Oh, as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.200
Time held me green and dying,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.200
Though I sang in my chains like the sea.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.200
Thank you.
