00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
Track 4. Let's face it, we were townies.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.880
Sorry about that. Now where was I? Oh yes, the other girls. Well, you see, we were all

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.600
sent here for training originally, to break us in, you know. No one was meant to be here

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.800
for more than a month or so, but the district officer, Owen his name was, he offered me

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.360
a job looking after the office. I'd been doing some clerical work back home, see.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.120
Fifteen of us came for the training and our first job was to go up to Pennlan on the other

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.260
side of the road. Somebody had already felled the trees so that they could be used for telegraph

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.520
poles. We then had to cut off the brash, you know, the branches, so they were just left

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.680
with the long trunks. At the end of each day we had to burn the brash and bury the ashes

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.900
in the ground. Oh, we'd come back to our dates with bloodshot eyes from the smoke and

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.700
hands blackened with a mixture of soil, ash and resin. Well, as the days went on, the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.720
weather got hotter and hotter and Charlie Williams, who was in charge of us, he saw

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.260
that we buried it correctly each day. Now, I remember there being some dispute that it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.180
was getting too dry to burn, but the powers that be said carry on. So we went up this

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.640
particular Saturday morning and we burned and we buried and Charlie made sure it was

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.640
buried correctly. Well, it was the postman that spotted the fire later that afternoon.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.200
Being so dry, it had gone underneath the ground and there was little anybody could do. Oh,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.440
it went up like tinder and right across the top of the mountain. Being so dry, there was

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.200
nothing you could do to stop it. It burnt for nearly a week it did. It was a disaster,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.380
even made the national news. They couldn't put it out with water. There was no water.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.800
The Aberglesrch was just a small stream. A lot of the people in the village went up to

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.080
help, including the forestry girls. Some cycled up on their bicycles, beating at the fire

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.500
with their coats. They claimed overtime for it too. We didn't go up, but someone told

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.160
me later that fire engines from Birkenhead and Birmingham came and the army too. It

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.400
was a wonderful sight, I have to say, but the land girls got the blame for it. We shouldn't

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.600
have been burning, but we were under orders, you know. Let's face it, we were townies and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.640
didn't know any better, but Charlie decided that it had been buried properly. I felt awful

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.480
and it didn't help our relations with the locals. But one silver lining, if you can

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.380
call it that, is that the whole mountainside, you know where the fire was, has been awash

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.340
with bilberries for the last couple of summers. Listen to me chatting on. We'd better keep

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.860
walking so you can see everything.
