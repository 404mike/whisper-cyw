00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
One interview with Mrs. Eris Williams of Edmonton.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.560
You were asking about the Welsh language.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.720
Now, this is very interesting, Glenys, because it goes back to the very beginning of what

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.560
I said about the Welsh church here.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:31.480
This has been a very integral part of the keeping of the Welsh culture of the language,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.160
particularly possibly for my sister's generation and mine.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.440
It was completely Welsh service, of course, and they carried out the format of the service

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.920
as much as they do in the Welsh chapels in Wales.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:59.480
And we simply had to go in front during the service, as many of the children did, to recite

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.960
Welsh verses or verses of hymns, biblical verses I was referring to first of all.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.040
And that, I think, is where we got our real grounding of the pronunciation and, well,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.280
the understanding of it.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.480
And all my parents were as Welsh as anyone who ever came out of Wales.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:29.120
My father was Mr. T. Morris Hughes from Molde in Flintshire, and our mother was from Rhytham.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.240
And they spoke every word of Welsh in the house, but somehow didn't carry on the conversation

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.360
with Stella and myself.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.240
We often mentioned it to them in later years.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:51.080
Mama used to say, well, you had your grounding in the Welsh verses and the way you memorized.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.840
It's really rather difficult to understand why they didn't keep it up.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.840
We understand practically every word.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.600
And then, of course, I was very fortunate to marry Len, who is from Anglesey, from Llanfodrog,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.480
Anglesey, and to this day, I tease him that he thinks in Welsh and speaks in English.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.600
And though we don't converse, he has never lost his Welsh.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.000
As a matter of fact, 16 years ago, we went back to Wales and he spoke as fluent Welsh

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
as he did.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
At that time, he'd been out here 35 years and simply thrilled everybody.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So of course, he kept my Welsh up.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.880
I used to do a little bit of singing, and of course, he did too.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:53.960
And our son, Glyn, learned his Welsh hymn, which he sang as guest soloist in San Francisco,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.680
National Gmanba there, through coaching by his father, Glyn, of course.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.440
So we have been very fortunate in being able to keep the... to a certain extent, the understanding.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.560
But I'm not very fluent in the actual conversational French, Welsh.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.160
Would you like to say just a few words in Welsh to finish?

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.280
Well, I rather stun my listeners occasionally.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:32.320
As a matter of fact, not too long ago, I was describing Anglesey and mentioning about

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:41.240
the littlest town there with the largest name in Llanfair, Pwll Gwengill, Gogaerwch, Hwyrindrobwll,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.720
Llandysillioogogoch.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:53.040
And I often played the record of the Pro's Male Voice Choir.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.960
And I'm always tempted, which I practically always do, tell them that it's all right to

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:09.400
say they're from Roos, but for those who know better, they come from Roos, Llanrhygog.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.680
And believe it or not, I found that really more of a problem than Llanfair P.G.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.040
But oh, I don't know.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.960
I think possibly I'll carry on this program.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.480
It is unique.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.080
As far as I know, I don't think there is another Welsh program in North America.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.720
I've never heard of any in the States.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.360
And I'm quite sure there isn't another one in Canada.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.320
If there is, I would most certainly like to hear of it.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.400
But CKUA is rather a unique station.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:58.440
It is non-commercial and just is centered around ethnic groups and has been a great

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.080
help to the Welsh community of Edmonton.
