00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What is your name?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
My name's Ian. I live in Bangor. And in Bangor I grow fruit trees.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I've been growing trees there for probably 30 years or so.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Prior to that I used to work in Canada in the woods.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And I was Mr Organic at that time, shall we say, in the area.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And about 15 years ago I found, or rather I took credit for the discovery of the Bardsey Island apple avalanche.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And that really sort of led to a resurgence of Welsh varieties.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And now that's all I do. I only produce Welsh varieties of apple and other fruit.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I had a friend called Andy and we used to creep around looking.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We'd go in our old orchards, for example, old abandoned orchards, old stately homes and stuff.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And looking for old trees that were still alive and doing well.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If a tree was 100 years old, let's say, and still producing and still healthy and producing good fruit,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
it would obviously be a good candidate to produce and grow in North Wales.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Because prior to that there was no written knowledge about how fruit trees were doing North Wales or Wales in general.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Because the people that wrote the books, they all came from Kent, the Garden of England, where all the big time experts are.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So me and Andy were creeping about, used to creep about.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And one summer or autumn he was working on Bardsey Island, ringing birds.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Because it's a migratory stop and there's the oldest bird observatory in Britain, in Bardsey Island apparently.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And someone said, go to that old apple tree by that house, mate, and put some apples in the mist net, you know, a funnel shaped thin net to catch the birds, which they can ring.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And he did that and didn't recognise what the apples were, ground in this strange little island.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And the tree had been smashed and battered against the wall of the house.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And despite that, the fruit were really clean and really good.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So he brought them to me, the fruit, I didn't know, going to the local experts supposedly, I didn't know what they were.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But I sent the fruit then to the National Fruit Collection.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This is just one and a half fruit really by then.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And the experts there proclaimed that it was a unique variety.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And since then it's been genetically fingerprinted so that we know that it is.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So that's how the Bardsey Island apple, the avalently, came about.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Interestingly, we just spoke to Emily from the Clamberis Cider Society.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And Andy was living in one little shed on the island.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Emily was living in another and they got it together.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And so it might well be maybe Emily and all her charms should take the credit for the discovery of the apple.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And so it was me that then started to propagate the tree and all the rest of it.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
That's it really.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000
OK, so for three or four years I started making Bardsey apple trees.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Making them at my own expense, going to the island collecting little titty bits of salt burnt wood.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And buying root stops and grafting them.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And then I'd make the trees, sell the trees and then give all the money to the trust that run the island.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
People would just make their checks out to the Bardsey Island Trust.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So I did that for three or four years, which was fine by me.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So then I started making the Bardsey apple and surprisingly selling them very well.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And then people started saying, oh, they've got rare apples in their garden.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
They've got old apples or things like that.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And I started then doing sort of academic research and gradually over the years accumulated a collection of 50 or so perhaps, something like that.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And gone wider now.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I mean the other big thing is the Denby plum, which is the only Welsh plum, which is about to get its PGI protected geographic indication status.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I think this year I'm going there on Sunday to find that out.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And that would be good because it would be a big deal for Denby.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Denby needs something. It's a ghost town really.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Just because they've either been bred or evolved or been found, that they do well in this climate.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
When I say this climate, I don't necessarily mean Clambereth youth hostel because no one lives above here.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
People used to grow fruit around here.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:04.000
But I think my theory is that once Lord Penryn financed the railway from basically from Penryn to the rest of the world,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Carrie's slate, you then got empty wagons bringing all kinds of other English produce.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So any Welsh orchards would have faded away.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I think there were commercial orchard projects in De Frenc Onwy Valley.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
There were commercials growing there I believe.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
They would just get swamped with imports.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Well I discovered another word.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I, by various ways, I've resurrected old varieties.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Obviously they're interesting from a cultural point of view with the big C.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And from a cultural point of view with the little C, they grow here.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Most varieties from England or other foreign countries won't do here.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It's too cold, it's too wet, it's too damp.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The soil's too poor. They don't ripen. There's not enough sunlight.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So if you get varieties that do well here, then you don't have to spray them.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:26.000
A lot of people want to grow things organically and they think that's just letting them grow, not spraying them.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But it doesn't work like that. You have to grow things organically.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
The number one thing is to plant the right varieties for your area.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Well, at Pant D, there's a big cider orchard that's got two and a half thousand trees at Penangreis, Jalisarn Penangreis Way.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
They've got about a thousand of my trees.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So it's good to see how each of those does in comparison with each other.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And also in comparison with standard cider varieties.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And for example, Gwech Namil, better than a thousand, Sikno Ferver, that is their favourite up there.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So that does really well and it has a lot of juice, so it's good for cider.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
All the others up there, all of mine are doing well.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I mean in comparison, or the Avalon Lee Bards is doing well for sweet cider.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:47.000
In comparison with most of the English ones, which are doing terribly, they're from Somerset or Devon or somewhere much a nicer climate than the North Wales have to offer.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So it's a good, with Richard up there, his mistakes are good as a knowledge base.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
You can go there and you can compare different varieties.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Hopefully your Roche Perry project is doing that sort of thing as well, isn't it?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Unfortunately that will take time before we get any results of that.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I don't think I would have suggested when the project was set up, it would have been good to have someone or people going around looking at existing trees and existing, you could get a lot of knowledge from that.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
You don't get any knowledge from a two-year-old tree at all, we don't get any fruit.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Whereas I don't think there was part of this project, was there?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I don't think of people going around looking, I mean someone could have come to me and gone through my computer records and hard copy records and then had a list of people that had bought trees off me and then they could have gone around Wales.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:22.000
If they were old records, like paper records, they could have gone around seeing how those trees were doing rather than, well both are good to plant trial orchards but also visiting existing trees.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I don't know, I'm not a cider producer and most of these varieties I would say nobody knows because they haven't been around, they've been around but neglected, they haven't been planted.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I mean that's what I said, you could have done with someone from the Royal Parry people, have gone around to have found that out.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:06.000
My trouble is I sell a bunch of trees to someone and then I rarely hear from them again and then also it's realistically going to take ten years before planting a tree and the tree is then getting to its maximum cropping potential.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Then we actually know how it does. For example, Guachnamil, the favourite at Pant D, the mother tree that I have has become strongly biennial. Loads of fruit one year, nothing the next.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Well that doesn't matter to me because I'm only really producing wood and knowledge when I grow a tree.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:45.000
If you're planting a commercial plantation you don't want your trees to become biennial which they don't, it takes a few years and obviously a few years of neglect before they get these biennial habits.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:12:02.000
If they are strongly biennial it makes them, you will be less inclined to plant them because you will have years with almost zero crop. A lot of side of the trees are biennial.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I've just grafted, I don't know, 2,300 trees, something like that. That's really intense. Not just doing the grafting but preparing everything and this year I changed my system totally as well of how to grow the trees.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I don't have a typical time. From November onwards I spend a lot of time packaging trees and sending them off. I'm primarily now an internet business.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I used to supply all the garden centres in the area and I've gradually stopped doing that. I still deal with the public, I get a lot of public come round.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I don't work five days a week, I mean I work seven days a week sometimes. I don't have any regular, it always seems to be stuff to do.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Yeah, well now I can have a little break. The grafting is done. Over this weekend I repaired problems with the irrigation system so now I could have a couple of weeks off, which I probably will.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
But there again I've got to repair polytunnels, you know, winter damage. I still haven't had time to do that yet.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000
If you go to my website now there's not much that I've got left. So hopefully sales are peaking off.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:45.000
People buy the trees all year round. You go to B&Q, people buy pots of plants with lovely pretty little flowers on. We're not meant to do that. If you plant them the flowers die.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000
People are out of touch with seasonality and out of touch with plant physiology. You should plant things when they're dormant.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:08.000
In garden centres people buy them with apples on, which you shouldn't do that. I used to obviously, being a proper nursery man, rub out any small fruit because they'd do well when they were planted.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:17.000
But then I realised that if you leave the fruit on people buy them more. So I stopped doing that, which is bad really. There's marketing and that.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:33.000
The trees that I've grafted can sit there. Summer's starting to move but there's a month or so of just rubbing out growth on the rootstocks to force the sap up into the scion with the piece of wood I've grafted on.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:47.000
In the summer I try and do something with my boys if that's possible, go away somewhere. Well I force myself to go. I pay people to look after the place.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I will lose trees to an extent and lose business to an extent but I don't really care. I'd rather have my life rather than the work situation.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Because I don't have land, I don't have a great big tractor that could plough up a field and I could stick all the trees in and walk away.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000
I just have a reclaimed swamp with a lot of builders' rubble on top of it. So it's not an ideal situation at all.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:34.000
If you want to be successful as a farmer or a grower, the best thing to do is inherit your father's farm. And I didn't do that, I made a mistake there.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Quite often unfortunately community groups end up in pretty useless places to plant the trees, like this place here is to be honest.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:57.000
It's interesting to find out what goes wrong with the trees but when you're given pieces it's hard to find pieces of land.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:05.000
The good lands are all tied up by the farmers as a rule. That's a major problem.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Also a major problem with community groups is it often ends up one or two people doing it. And then if there's one or two people sort of fade away, the trees are just left.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I've just spent some time at Moylakee and I've said I'd go back there and help them. These are trees that I supplied them about 15 years ago and they're terrible.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And over the years people have come, took an interest and then faded away. And I go there every couple of years and offer advice and do stuff.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Usually unpaid, gets a bit depression really after a while.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.000
You know, that's the nature of community projects. I'm not running them down but often they get the worst land.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Here I would say it's unsuitable but it was available obviously. Where they planted at Moylakee was unsuitable but available.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:17.000
That's often the problem. Land in this country, good land, is hard to come by. I mean I don't have any.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:28.000
I think I donated a load of trees to the surgery in Clamberis. There's not a great place because I think they get vandalised quite easily.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Some that, and then you get counsel. The trouble is, especially with fruit trees, it requires quite a lot of knowledge, quite a lot of prior knowledge.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:49.000
So really you could say that the first few generations of trees you buy could well be destined to failure.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:59.000
The first trees I planted I got from the skip behind Moylakee where they'd thrown them out thinking this is great, I'm getting trees for nothing.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Well it probably took ten years for me growing those unsuitable trees I've got to grow to find out that they were disease prone.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
That I'd chosen them. Even if I'd bought them they would have been the wrong ones.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:27.000
If you've got community groups, people at large, commercial people like Richard of Pandy, he planted two and a half thousand cider trees.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And he's already replaced over a thousand of those, grabbed them up with a thousand of mine, Welsh ones are more suitable.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:46.000
So I would say almost everybody is destined to make mistakes. If you go to a garden centre they're bloody useless, they don't know anything.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
If you go to Liddell's or Tesco's to buy your trees where people buy them now, they know nothing.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:05.000
They know nothing and you won't even, you would just, people just assume that what are in Tesco's in the fruit section are ones that will grow in your garden.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Why wouldn't they? And they don't. Especially in North Wales or Wales in general.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:21.000
So yeah I would say whoever plants their trees their first one or two orchards are going to be a steep learning curve as a rule.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Obviously there's more knowledge out there now, like with you lot, with me to an extent I suppose.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000
People will come to me and say I want some trees for Clamberis and I now have a bit of an idea.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Whereas prior to that they would sell you, the garden centres sell you the trees that people know.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:49.000
The trees that grow in up here on the shelves in Tesco's. Read your books, read your books.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
But some people would do that. There's plenty of stuff online obviously.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
But unfortunately people starting off aren't aware of the problems.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:10.000
If you don't know anything, chances are you will assume that you could just go to a garden centre, pay your money and plant the tree.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And the garden centre staff now are totally untrained as a rule. They will know nothing either.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
You ideally go online and there's plenty of stuff there.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I mean I spent a lot of years collecting varieties from places with a Celtic climate.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Like I've still got a lot of Irish apples, a lot of Devon Cornwall apples, a lot of Scottish ones that have all got comparable climates to here.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
To test them, to see how, and that's what I used to do.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.000
I was making a collection of disease resistant varieties that would do well in Wales.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:06.000
With the discovery of the Avowentley, Bardsley Island apple, I then changed my direction because I then started to sell Welsh ones.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Some of the Welsh ones of course just because they happen to have come from Wales doesn't necessarily mean they would do in all of Wales.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Wales really varies climatically like the Monmouth ones. Monmouth is the same as England, it has been isn't it, in its day.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And then you've got altitude differences. You've got the highest mountain, the lowest beaches.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
So you've got Snowdon just behind us and you've got Anglesey just down there.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Sea level is only four or five miles away.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.000
So what might do well in Carnarvon might not do well where we are now for example.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:58.000
To do your research, the trouble with doing research is you often have to be pre-warned as to what you're looking for and you might not know that.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:10.000
I had a lady, she bought trees off me in the past and she was commercial and she wanted 25 of these, 25 of that and 50 Bakers Delicious.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And I said why on earth would you want 50 Bakers Delicious?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Because they're an early apple and they go off in a couple of weeks.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:30.000
You've got 50 trees, you've got 100 pounds, that's 5,000, that's five tonnes of apples which you've got to get rid of in two weeks or something.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:41.000
And she'd done all her research and asking around and it turned out Bakers Delicious did well where she lived and everybody liked it.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
But she didn't realise it's a bit like having 5,000 lettuces.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
You've got a problem if you grow something like that, haven't you?

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
You're much better off spreading something out.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
So she'd done her research but not quite enough.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
That's the trouble.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:10.000
So it's a difficult problem and I've made more mistakes than anybody I'm sure over the years, planted inappropriate things.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And then you can then get a little bit of knowledge and you find that, like I say, that a variety might be disease resistant but the season is very short so you can only have a few of those.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Or it might be biennial.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:41.000
You could easily end up planting four or five orchards sequentially one after the other, gradually improving how you do it.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
But after you've done four or five you're probably dead.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
It's a lifetime gone, isn't it?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
So all this stuff, it's really protracted.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
That's why your two-year project is you need to spend the rest of your life doing this.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
I'm sure you can't face it but that's what you should do.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:08.000
And even then when you do that then you get climate change so Wales will soon no longer have a Welsh climate.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
So that's something else to consider.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
We're now 22 days in advance of what we used to be.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I'm grafting 22 days earlier.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000
This is, we've got lots of records of national fruit collection and stuff of when things flower and the rest of it.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
We're 22 days earlier.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
That makes it, it's not as simple as 22 days.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:46.000
It's not as simple as grafting 22 days earlier because last year I grafted, it was really hot, I panicked, I grafted early then it got really cold and I lost quite a few hundred trees because of that.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
You've got things like diseases changing.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Brown rock millennia is devastating all the plums and damsons around here.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I'm selling the denby plum as a disease resistant plum.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:14.000
If conditions change then it might, the denby plum, it's the same thing that's produced in the 1780s that hasn't changed.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:25.000
But millennia, the disease can change, the climate can change so that it could therefore make that plum variety susceptible.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
So nobody knows. It's a difficult problem.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:40.000
It's a long term project but the climate and the world might be changing quicker than our knowledge can evolve.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
There's a happy note there for you.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Well, my neighbour used to sell carpets.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
His hobby, and I've worked through trees in his garden, was raising pigeons.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
He's an internationally famous and successful pigeon racer.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
He's got about 300 in his loft.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:11.000
And I said to him, why don't you stop selling carpets and concentrate on your pigeons?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
And he said it would probably, he would lose his hobby and it would become a job.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
And that was up to me. It's a job. I don't really, it's my job now.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
That makes it different, doesn't it?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
I don't go to Canada, I used to work in Canada every year. I don't go there anymore.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
I do this. I don't know why I do it.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
I've had my son working for me the last couple of weeks. That's been really good.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:47.000
He's just got a degree from Cardiff in music composition.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000
It would be great if he took it over to an extent but I rather doubt it.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Kids don't want to do that sort of stuff anymore.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I do it because people ring me up and you have to do it sort of thing.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
But I've never worked so much in my life as constantly, I've never done that before.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
I used to do more exciting things.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
I'd go to Canada, make my money and then do whatever.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Travel the world or try and change it.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
I'm not doing that at the moment.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.000
I would like to, I would really like to go down to Kent or wherever

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
and see how the big boys do it. But there's such a leap.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
I'm only backyard really.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:46.000
I did go to a Kent grower, friend of a friend, and he'd been there.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
I think they'd been there five generations.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
He's had three farms, huge, huge, huge.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:59.000
And within a few sentences I knew I was in another league.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
I didn't know what he was talking about.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
There are no courses in pirmology.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
As far as I did look, I looked quite hard a few years ago.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
I'm not worried about getting some certificate to hang on the wall,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I've got enough of that stuff.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
I'm not worried about academic qualifications,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.000
but I just thought if I tagged along and went down there for a couple of weeks somewhere,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
I just couldn't find anything.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
I was quite shocked really.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
And maybe that's how it is.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Maybe there are other courses.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
I did look.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
There is a course in September, Welsh Perry one,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
which I signed up for, said I was interested.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
But then having looked at the website of the people doing it,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
it's all very permacultury, which is all very well,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
but probably might not go to that.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
But otherwise, yeah, I'd like to go down to Kent to see.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
There's Mickey Mouse and it about, or small scale.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
And then there's the big industrial scale, and not much in between.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
So I'd like to, there's lots to learn out there, isn't there?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000
And with everything in life, the more you know, the more you know there is to know.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
You can do it like I do it, just trial and error.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Well, that implies that most of the things you do are wrong,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
which is fair enough, it's how you learn.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
But I would like to go in some courses like Pershaw College.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
I rung them up and there was nothing there.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000
The local college, the North Wales one, at Northop, they ring me up.
