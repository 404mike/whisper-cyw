00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
at the end of 1983 it really started to, you know, things started to look very bad across Britain and the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in February I think it was, wasn't it, the strike started, 1984.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I think everybody forgets that South Wales voted pretty overwhelmingly against taking strike action.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You know, the lodges all met on that weekend and by Saturday night we knew we'd lost and that South Wales

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
essentially had voted to not to take strike action and I'm absolutely convinced that was because

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
they garnered so much intelligence and information during the skirmishes that led up to 1984.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
They knew damn well what was likely to happen.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But we organised the picketing for the Monday morning. We took a decision off our own backs.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It was the centre of the Coalfield, the left in the centre, we all met up in the Herwine Ambulance Room

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and we got boys we trusted from all over the Coalfield.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Even some from way down west, you know, Kenydra and from the east, from the Kilenen Collieries.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And we all, we farmed a pit out to everybody for the following morning.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But it took us until the Wednesday or the Thursday I think to get everybody out on strike in South Wales.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And it was completely illegal.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You know, we'd always been very proud of democracy in South Wales.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And you know, we just, I mean we knew what would happen.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We knew that if South Wales didn't come out, well you could forget it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But also you were going to get parties of people down here from Yorkshire and Kent.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And you know, we never had that.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So we tried to persuade everybody to come on strike, but it was very difficult and sometimes very dangerous.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But that's for another.
