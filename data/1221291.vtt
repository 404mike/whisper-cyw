00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It was just brilliant. We had such fun. It was just, you know, everybody was in the show,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or a lot of people were in the show, so there was that camaraderie that you get anyway.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You know, you build friendships quicker when you're in amateur dramatics of any type.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You bond in such a way. And we just had so many laughs, arguments and laughs. It was amazing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
When we started to do the shows, the Zioner ladies used to cook a three-course meal for a hundred-odd people.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
They'd be in the kitchen all day in between rehearsing, in the heat of the kitchen, arguing with each other.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And then they'd come on the stage laughing, you know, smiling, etc. But the camaraderie was unbelievable.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Unbelievable. They would never get outside of the provinces.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And when you think Cardiff is a small community, and you would imagine that Liverpool, Manchester, would have these great things going on,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
nobody had that. Nobody had that. The ladies used to come from the head office in London, Zioner,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and they used to come and they used to marvel at the community.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The shows, you know, they weren't brilliant when we started because the majority had never been on stage before.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But the camaraderie, you could touch, you could feel it. It swamped you.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And you've been here a little bit over 40 years. Yeah.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What changes have you noticed in that time then? It must have changed.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Oh, so much. The dwindling of the community. The dwindling of the community.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Really, Wolf is a great person for really giving everybody a kick to keep that community together as best she can.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
There's still key people here. Another lady, Judy Cotson. Judy and Hayden Cotson.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Brilliant at attempting to keep the community together. But it's the dwindling community, which is great sadness.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Not a kosher butcher here anymore. Kosher butcher has to come from away.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So how are you managing that? Are you ordered from London?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Yeah, I mean a lot of us have got kids in London, so we'll go and we'll stock up a bit. Good old freezer, etc.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The kosher butcher does come once a week and has a little place, it's like Anatevka, if you go on the roof, by the synagogue.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Yeah, the van pulls up and they go into their little hut and sell their wares.
