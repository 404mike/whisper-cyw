Well, there was a carpenter, Philip the Carpenter.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
He used to, he was a clever old chap and a good tradesman.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And he used to make the coffins for the workers.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And the workers had to pay eight new a week towards the coffin ward.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And then if they died, you'd have the coffin for nothing.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That's through the company.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They'd stop eight new a week, coffin ward, they called it.
