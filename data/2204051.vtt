And honestly getting over this bridge which was then the 7th bridge was like whoa

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.280
This is it. This is me. This is me. I'm home even though of course

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.060
I didn't know anything about you know what was down there. It was just something about I don't know I can't express it it was

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.880
the feeling of peace which I'd never known in

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.600
England

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.640
And he's like I don't want to leave well, you know

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.400
Just going over the bridge to England when he says welcome to India I go

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.160
really depressed

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.660
That's that's how it happens. And then you come back to Wales. This is Croeso Cymru. Oh be back
