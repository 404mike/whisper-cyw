00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
Two friends, Jen and Laura, talk about some of the difficulties they have in staying in touch.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:16.240
We got along in work and although like we're doing very different things now and that has an impact like on when we can meet up and stuff.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.120
You've got kids and I'm studying.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.320
You'll have kids too.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.040
I'm going to have kids too, yeah, which will change things again.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.600
Yeah.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.720
So it's made it difficult to stay in like close contact because we were kind of operating in different like...

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.840
And I don't drive as well.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.640
I think if I drove it'd be easier because I could just bring you and Shamro or you two up to come down for an hour.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:52.160
Like it's not viable to come down for an hour when you don't drive because this journey is what 20 minutes from where I live in a car.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.360
But it's like 45 minutes on a train and then it's 20 minute walk.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360
So it doesn't work out.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.760
So if we see each other it's like on the weekends.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.080
Yeah, and for a couple of hours, isn't it?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.640
Yeah, we like doing a thing.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.800
I'm like seeing something or going somewhere because of the practicalities.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.600
Yeah.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:21.520
But yeah, no, well, I guess that we've stayed in contact because we enjoyed each other's company and we both valued the friendship and the things we got from that.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.920
And plus you're the best godmother ever.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.960
And we are.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.920
Just be honest.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.800
You know, she loves her Auntie Jen.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.120
My godmother.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.360
Yeah, you'll be living with her now, carry on.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.520
Tell her that all the time.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.520
She's like, I will move there.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.360
I'm like, yeah, I bet you would as well.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.360
We're waiting for her to knock on the door.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.680
Come for an email, V.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.200
She'll never move me then.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.720
I'm not doing teenagers.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.200
Give her a 4-ed.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.200
I think she'll be in teenage years before 13.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.320
She already is.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.680
She already is, obviously.
