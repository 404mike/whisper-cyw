00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
Hello, Tony Byrd speaking, actually Ralph, Anthony Byrd, Tony for short,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.360
but I was at school, I was always called Dickie. Anyway, here we go, I was born in Cowbridge,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.560
L'Morgan in 1924. My father ran an agricultural, well it was really an ironmongry business,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.520
which he inherited from his father, which I think was started in 1783, so it was quite a

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.520
well-established business. I was educated at Pontbine Council School in Cowbridge from the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.120
age of about probably three until ten when my father went up to Gloucestershire to open a branch

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.680
because the Cowbridge business is doing very well and he'd been offered the franchise with the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.920
Massey, or not then Massey, but the Ferguson tractor and he'd been offered quite a number of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.960
counties distributed. Anyway, now that's jumping ahead a bit. I was educated at

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.560
Gnarling School's Shroud and then I went to Wycliffe College at Stonehouse, which was a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.520
boarding school quite adjacent to our home and the school was evacuated to Lampeter

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.240
during the early part of the war because the Admiralty had taken a fancy to the school buildings

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.480
and I went to Lampeter where I stayed for three years very happily. We used to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.240
organise shooting parties for rabbits, I remember. The local farmers were very keen, but we, of course,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:52.000
we shouldn't have had guns there, but three or four of us organised little shooting parties and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.800
we had a good time. I think my vivid memory of Lampeter was the winter of 42 when the local lake

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.080
froze up and I think we were skating up there for many, many times and we had great fun.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.600
I played for the school at Cricket and Rugby and was contemporary with Gilbert Parkhouse,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.520
who later became an England cricketer and a Welsh rugby footballer.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:33.440
While I was at Lampeter, we were visited by a naval officer who was trying to conscript

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:42.000
public school boys for the Navy and I actually volunteered at that time. I think I was about 17

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.200
and I attended an interview in Swansea and when I left school at the age of 18,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:58.160
I was sent a letter asking to report to ACMS at Raleigh in Devonport where I spent three

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.400
arduous months marching up and down and generally being taught how to behave.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.320
I think one of my vivid memories of that was taking rowing courses on one of the rivers

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.720
and deliberately catching the horse. We fell backwards and the chief pass officer thought

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:35.040
that was a really good joke and he took it in good part. Anyway, after that, I went to a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.400
barracks in Devonport and was then sent to join a ship which was just being refitted in Harlequin

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:55.120
Wolf's Yard in Belfast. ACMS escapade. We were a completely new crew, the ship having been

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:03.760
extensively refitted after many very difficult arctic convoys and we understood from some of

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:13.200
the old crew that they'd been on that infamous convoy, Q17, where the Navy were totally disbanded

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.560
leaving the merchant ships to the mercy of the Germans. Whether that was actually true in essence,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:32.480
I don't honestly know. Anyway, the ship we worked, we had trials after the refit and my memory there

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:42.000
is one of us, our steering motor failed owing to I think sabotage and we rammed a jetty which put

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.760
us back about a fortnight and then we went up to Scapa Flow to work up where we did extensive

00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:02.960
gunnery and sea trials and we went up to Bear Island and being a sort of potential officer

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:13.040
material, I was posted as a lookout on the bridge where we were able to observe the operation of the

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:21.280
ship as a whole. While working up, I was asked to spot the port of Shot when we were

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:32.240
undertaking gunnery files at day and night. Anyway, we did some Atlantic convoys and we were

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:41.440
then detailed to accompany a huge fleet of ships going down to North Africa for the operation Torch

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:49.280
which was a joint American British invasion of North Africa. I always remember we were escorting

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:57.520
HMS Furious, the aircraft carrier, and she was taking a pretty rough trip going down to the Bay

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:05.280
of Biscay and I always remember Seafarers taking off her deck. The deck must have been at angles

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.800
of 15 to 20 degrees and how the pilots ever got the things done I don't honestly know.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.440
But after Operation Torch, we did we returned to Gibraltar and stayed there for some weeks I

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.960
remember and then we went back to Scapa Flow, did a couple of Atlantic convoys and I left the ship

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:39.520
in January 1943 having been asked to attend the training college at Brighton HMS Alfred.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.560
Anyway, I went to HMS Alfred and was promoted to temporary midshipman but that was,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.560
I remember rescinded, they wrote in my paybook promoted to temporary midshipman RNVR

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.400
but the captain Pelly was in charge he sent for me he said I think that you're a bit too young

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:10.000
to go see as a midshipman I think I'm going to send you back for further training at sea.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:22.240
So that's what happened but well I was then in Devonport dockyard, the barracks, and a fleet order

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.600
appeared on the notice board asking for people to volunteer as fleet air arm pilots

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.640
and as I was at a dead end waiting for another ship and nothing seemed to be happening I volunteered

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:46.080
and I just went for an interview I think in Brighton for that and then reported to HMS St. Vincent

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:57.680
which I think was in Portsmouth where we did a three-month training course as sort of forthcoming

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:04.960
pilots in the fleet air arm and during that time I was put forward for what they a draft called the

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:13.120
Admiral Towers Scheme which meant we would be sent training to America to be trained by the marines

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.880
and that's what happened we went I went across to America and I think in about probably June,

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:30.560
June of 43 and went to Grosse Eagle having landed at Halifax Nova Scotia in a snowstorm I always

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:40.000
remember we traveled to Detroit by train and although the railway carriage had double glazing

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I remember the snow was blowing in on us sleeping in our seats very very cold anyway Grosse Eagle

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.240
was an eye-opener American marine pilots trained us very very good and efficient they were mostly

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:06.240
young people I was taught to fly by an ensign and also by a lieutenant and but pretty young people

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:16.960
we I I forget we trained on trained on two wings by planes quite quite nice they're bigger than

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:26.800
the Tiger Moth and I went solo after about 12 hours and stayed Grosse Eagle for about three months

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.160
clocking up 50 or 60 hours of flying time but I think it was a biplane steerman very nice

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:42.000
air very very capable aircraft very steady it must have been for me to fly it anyway after

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:51.920
arriving at Grosse Eagle I think there were about 30 of us in the party we were asked to attend a

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:58.800
reception which is being held I think by the United Services Organization anyway at a

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:09.600
at a hotel in Detroit where we met with quite a number of Americans who adopted each one of

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:18.320
each family adopted one of us which is very good and I was adopted by the the the husband and wife

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:25.520
the husband being the manager of the Detroit Gas Company which is interesting anyway they they were

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:32.160
very very kind and every weekend if we had to leave they used to come to the base of Grosse

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:39.280
Eagle and pick us up and take us out you know show us sights and were very very hospitable

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:47.840
so that was interesting anyway after after some I I did quite a bit of flying at Grosse

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.840
Eagle I think the aircraft was steerman by planes I can't remember the model but they were

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:02.800
quite nice aircraft I didn't really enjoy flying I went solo after about 12 hours but I've to be

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:10.480
quite honest I found flying boring the the instructors were marine

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.520
American marine pilots mostly young and they were very meticulous always telling us to keep

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.080
if your engine fails where you were you going to land and all that sort of thing

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:32.480
and on one occasion we actually had engine failure and we landed at a farm and I remember I think

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:40.160
it was in the middle of a maize crop and the farmer came out in constation because we'd

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.960
ruined quite a bit of his landing and he wanted to know when he discovered I was busiest he wanted

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:56.160
if I just so mere dynamic which is rather amusing so this went on for some weeks

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:07.440
I think I did about 50 hours flying and then I was asked by Lieutenant Commander Jackson R.M. to

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:15.360
report to his office where he advised me that I was going to leave the course and would

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:23.760
be returning to the UK to join the fleet somewhere and that happened I returned

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:30.000
after about a couple of weeks spent in New York which is very interesting waiting for a ship

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:40.320
I write back I think in granite and report it back to Davenport where I stayed for some weeks

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:49.360
and then was asked to report to a class corvette agent to Macy's which was stationed at Cherness

00:12:50.320 --> 00:13:00.560
and I reported there a very very very lovely little ship very very very nice crew I think the

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:08.400
crew could serve probably I think totaled about 30 or 40 but they were all very very nice chaps

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.800
because a border corps had the sleeping arrangement of very very odd they had a series

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:24.320
of flat wooden bunks adjacent to each other in the mid part of the ship we used to we didn't have a

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:31.360
bunk allocated to us we if one person left we just hopped into the the the one which was available

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:38.640
and that went on which is very very good so after some weeks we we did

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:50.320
North Sea convoys and then channel convoys and we were under fire I remember from German batches on

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:57.200
the French coast they used to lob over shells of the convoys you were escorting in the hope of

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:06.240
making a hit but they never seemed to and that went on for some time but we were all aware that

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.240
there was something going to happen because there was a tremendous lot of rumours flying around about

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:22.400
the invasion upcoming invasion and we continued with these convoys and then we were based in

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:29.280
Chesnes but we used to go ashore in Southend quite a lot if we were you know in that vicinity

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:35.680
you know I always remember going up the tremendously long pier which we used to anchor off and then

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:43.120
if we had a bit of leave we would go trundle up this tremendously long causeway to town

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:52.240
and later to rejoin the ship about midnight which was good anyway D-Day approach we were

00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:00.800
ordered to pick up a convoy going a guy heading for Aramon but we didn't know that at the time

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:09.600
and my most vivid memory of the invasion was the tremendous number of aircraft flying over as we

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:16.640
were going across channel there were literally hundreds of aircraft going over obviously going

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:26.720
in to drop their troops inland in anticipation of the invasion and we eventually arrived off a

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:37.760
little port called Aramon where we escorted quite a number of LCA's ashore some light fire

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:46.160
uh artillery fire and rifle fire but not very much and I remember I was standing on the bridges

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:53.680
as a lookout and a bullet whizzed past my left ear at high velocity and I said good god that

00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:03.600
was a close one but that was the nearest I came to to fire at that time so we we proceeded to escort

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:10.480
ships across the we particularly remember the Mulberry Casen the big

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:18.960
sort of huge tanks which were acting as temporary harbors we escorted those across and also

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.160
a couple of ships with huge reels on them which turned out to be Pluto

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:35.920
the fuel lines and as they proceeded across the the reels disembarked their hoses and these were

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:44.080
eventually connected up at the Mulberry so the troops had plenty of petrol and diesel at their

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:57.360
command so this went on for some weeks we moved from beach to beach and at that time or some

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:05.120
little time later the Germans started firing their rockets over at particularly at London

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:11.680
this is the v1s what they called the v1 yeah and I had the great

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:22.160
honor of shooting one down um with an oricon which the the the rocket actually grazed

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:28.800
Dungeness lighthouse and exploded so I was very glad it didn't hit the lighthouse otherwise I was

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.800
being court-martialed I would think but the Americans were particularly good

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:42.560
at flying alongside these these rockets and tipping their wings over so that they they lost their

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:53.200
sense of direction and plunged to earth exploding in in the sea or on land particularly the the

00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:04.560
army put up a most tremendous barrage at night the whole of the coast was alive with with gunfire

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:12.000
shooting at these rockets and they were quite successful in shooting a number down but

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.760
unfortunately a lot as we all know got through to London causing tremendous havoc and then the v2

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:26.000
started going which we couldn't we didn't know about it heard about that they they they were

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:35.120
beyond human intervention they used to land unexpectedly causing untold damage so there we

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:43.680
are I've got a listen I've got the invasion behind me uh we we've encountered the rockets

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:54.560
and then yes what occurred then sometime I was asked to report to HMS King Alfred Brighton which

00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:01.920
was a training school for potential officers and I went there and did a three-month course

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:10.880
and was commissioned as a sub lieutenant RNBR temporary in brackets and joined

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:21.280
joined uh we were set up to decline to fairfields yard at govern to join us a landing ship tank

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:28.080
which was in course of construction at that yard I was the first officer to report

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:36.400
to commander bell who was eventually to become for a leader of a flotilla of 10

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:45.440
LSTs and the first job he gave me the worst he said dicky I want you to we are going out to the

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:54.960
far east I want you to get as much booze as you can in the wardroom locker wine store so I spent

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:03.200
many days going around Glasgow to various whiskey distilleries trying to catch cases of scotch

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.680
out of them and to be honest it's quite successful because we when we eventually

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:17.600
say that the wine locker was particularly full commander bell he was a heaps of big chap about

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:27.840
66 heavily built excellent seaman had been in been in the far east under uh commanding oil vessels

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:36.400
before the war but he was a tremendous drinker in harbor he never touched a drop at sea but in

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:43.840
harbor he used to go you know he used to go quite heavily on the bottom stuff and he used to try

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:51.360
and get the his young sub lieutenant drunk so that he could tease them and allocate them difficult

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:59.040
tasks it was so I stood by this LST for about probably two or three weeks

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:06.720
limited on a Glasgow family and I always remember they had a daughter

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.840
who I think was trying to trying to seduce me but I avoided her advances very fortunately

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:26.880
anyway we sailed a sail for the far east I think the ship was uh flotilla leader but we

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:34.880
they were building the ships at that time we didn't have maybe sailed for Plymouth in company with

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:44.000
one other LST and we had only three officers aboard at that particular time so it was watch

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:52.880
on watch and as a very inexperienced sub lieutenant I felt my responsibilities very heavily but

00:21:52.880 --> 00:22:00.880
nothing under war transpired and we safely arrived at Plymouth where we picked up I think

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:09.760
seven or eight other officers including a doc who doctor who being recently recently commissioned

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:19.360
he was our NBR and he his father was a very prominent surgeon in London and he turned out

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:26.560
to be an absolutely marvelous chap you're capable of carrying out all sorts of difficult operations

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:37.440
at sea as I'll recount later and we eventually sailed the far east in company with I think three

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:49.440
other LSTs proceeding through the bay land arriving at Gibraltar where we oiled ship pretty slow

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:56.480
after the corvettes are not fast vessels but they used to average about 15 knots the LSTs we used to

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:05.760
average voyage speed was about 10 knots which is very very slow really in comparison

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:14.560
to a destroyer which I also had experience of an important anecdote has come to mind regarding my

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:24.960
service on HMS Escapade during an Atlantic convoy we needed oil so we proceeded to the Azores

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:35.120
to do so the Azores being a Portuguese owned and neutral at the time and we oiled and I recall

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:41.920
loading up with the ship loading up with a tremendous number of pineapple pineapple which were

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:49.520
in production on the Azores at that time quite heavily we loaded the ship up and I think they

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:58.800
kept us going for about 10 days until we got to got back to harbor in the UK anyway while we we

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:08.240
oiled and then left left about midday and as we were leaving to our amazement a German U-boat

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:16.640
was entering the harbor and we the officers saluted each other and all the ratings were

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:23.280
waving at each other we were quite astounded of course we realized that the the island being

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:30.560
neutral it could accommodate warships of any nation and that's what occurred

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:38.320
anyway that was an interesting experience and it made me think how futile war really was because

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:46.320
we here we were waving to people who were the next day would like to blow us out of the water

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:57.840
so having having arrived at jib we were ordered to proceed to Naples to pick up some Sherman

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:08.240
rotation tanks for the oncoming invasion of Malaya which was the intention of the British

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:16.320
governments and the Americans of course this was the bringing about the downfall of Japan

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:26.240
we discovered that the operation was called operation zipper and we were to land in the

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:33.360
land at some date in the future and we were picking up these tanks from Naples which are then

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:40.320
surplus to requirements the the German war having finished some weeks before

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:50.000
so we picked up 14 Sherman tanks we were in company then I think with five other LSTs of

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:00.720
Argentina and proceeded to Aden and then to Suez through the canal and across the Indian Ocean

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:10.720
the only episode of note there being one of the LSTs one of their ratings suffered appendicitis

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:21.360
and we had to transfer lieutenant Roxburgh by boat to the other LST with very very heavy seas

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:30.160
running so we successfully transferred him with great difficulty I let you know but

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:40.480
we couldn't recover our boat because the sea conditions were too bad so we the crew had to

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:47.920
jump up scrambling nets to come aboard again and we sank our lovely motorboat by gunfire so it

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:54.160
wouldn't be a hazard to other shipping and we then proceeded not Roxburgh couldn't

00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:02.240
couldn't rejoin our ship so we left him aboard the other LST until we reached Bombay where we

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:15.920
refueled I discovered when we were in Aden the captain commander Bell thought it would be very

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:23.680
nice if we had some form of transport and I remember surreptitiously a jeep being

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:33.760
wholly being landed aboard us I think it was stolen of course but it landed on our in one

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:42.080
of our holes and so he was determined to have transport of his own and it turned out that I

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:48.880
was the only chap aboard only officer aboard who could drive which is rather astonishing but this

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:59.120
was in year 43 or 44 and I was commissioned to take him with this jeep to naval headquarters in

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:07.040
Bombay to pick up our orders and driving through the streets of Bombay in a jeep with which I was

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:13.520
very familiar was quite a feat of engineering because the Indians they just would not take any

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:24.160
notice or give way to road traffic so we stayed in in Bombay for a couple of weeks made honorary

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:31.920
members of the Saturday Club which was an exclusive club which the Brits seemed to establish in all

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:40.640
ports where we played tennis and I always recall that instead of having two you know the the

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:48.880
Indians they they they love helping other people instead of having two ball boys or one ball boy

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:55.760
playing tennis they used to have about six so we didn't have to stoop to pick up a ball or

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:02.560
anything like that which is great anyway we had a lovely time in Bombay and then sailed for

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:12.160
Calcutta which would turn out to be our base and we landed there in company by this time I think

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:23.200
we all had eight eight other LSDs in company and we landed there doing various exercises off

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:30.080
of Calcutta and then we were detailed to go up to Rangoon for some reason to

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:36.880
but I think deliver some Indian troops to the Burmese war our next port of call

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:44.800
proved to be Aden and we entertained our passengers with shoots quizzes and deck games to keep up

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:55.600
morale we left Aden on 7th April 46 foot passage to the UK calling at port side Oran and and

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:04.480
Drogota the only notable events during the voyage were the recovery of a man overboard by LSD-3007

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:15.120
which took only 15 minutes a really good recovery our diversion to Oran to land seriously of failure

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:25.680
sailors soldier honor who happily we recovered who happily recovered we later heard to much

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:35.440
jubilation by all on board we birthed at Spithead on 30th of April 1946 and the ship finally paid

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:47.360
off there the total number of miles completed by LSD-307 during his commission amounted to 34,968

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:58.080
and over 3,000 troops and civilians 480 tanks and vehicles and 3,800 tons of stores

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:07.280
which delivered to strategic destinations during that time the ability of MSTs

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:18.080
to reach virtually anywhere their shallow draft and vast storage spaces ensured their gainful

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:28.160
deployment in all phases of operation and this was fully illustrated in both the European and

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:36.880
Far Eastern campaigns on leaving the Navy in August 46 I joined the family agriculture

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:43.040
engineering businesses in Boston and Stafford dealing in Ferguson and Massey had its equipment

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:54.240
of all types in 2015 I was invited to apply for a French decoration and was honoured on returning

00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:00.480
from a trip abroad to find a letter from the French Embassy in London enclosing the medal in

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:09.840
and signature chevalier de la liga donnaire which was a tremendous surprise and what a really fine

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:16.320
gesture on the part of the French I thought and that's about brings it to an end too
