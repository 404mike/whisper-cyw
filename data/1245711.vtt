00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
I was nervous too. I think I was in a similar position to you.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.400
I didn't know where we were going or...

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.040
Obviously we knew the people were in the car but we didn't know what we would be doing

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.600
or what work would look like on a day-to-day basis.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.600
Like what it would be like to be in the office.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.600
It was very random.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.600
Yeah, it did end up being very random to fit with what worked for us

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.600
and what worked for the things we needed to do.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.600
So my first impressions of you, I can't really remember now exactly

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:55.600
but I do remember the last image I have I think is of you kind of hiding towards the gate at the back at Mencap

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.600
looking really nervous and unsure.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.600
But I think because I was so nervous as well I didn't really take much...

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
I didn't really pay much attention to that.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600
It felt normal.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.600
Yeah, sorrow was trying to make me speak to everyone that day.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600
And Becky.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600
It was a bit like, where are you? Get away.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.600
Who are you people?
