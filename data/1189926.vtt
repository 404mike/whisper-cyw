00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
Well, basically, normally most of the time, all the rooms only have single beds in,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500
so all they've done is pushed two single beds together.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.600
But because of the framework on the outside, it leaves quite a gap in between the two beds,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.000
so it's not an ideal situation. You know, we basically have to roll up another quilt.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.400
It's like a quilted blanket, isn't it?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.800
And we roll that up and slide that down, but it's still not ideal, but it's better than nothing at all.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.400
What do you need in order to just have a double bed?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.600
We need two profilers, or the two sides that profile,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.000
but both sides need to be able to raise up so that they can get the hoists underneath.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.400
I know they are available, but I also know they carry a pretty price tag.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.400
So would you have to pay for that or would be it up the council or something?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.400
No, we would.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.400
We would have to pay, unfortunately.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.400
How does it feel not having to sleep in that situation?

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.200
Soul strain. You can't lie next to your husband at night

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.800
and even do something simple like fall asleep with your head in his chest.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.600
No simple things that most people take for granted in a normal double bed. We miss that.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.800
And we're not even talking about the intimate side of it.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.600
That is the icing on the cake.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.600
I mean that can be got round in a hammer if you feel that way inclined,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.400
but it is just, like Steve said, the very basic things of watching a film and putting your arms around each other.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.600
Just lots of little things really.
