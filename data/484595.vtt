Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.480
Interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewee Nicola Fogarty.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.040
We are holding the interview in the Swooker office

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.480
and today's date is the 2nd of October 2015.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.280
Nicky, well that is your name by which we know you.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.720
Could you spell your full name for us for the record please?

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.720
Certainly, N-I-C-O-L-A-F-O-G-A-T-Y.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.240
Full marks, very good.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.400
Okay.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.680
So Cardiff Carnival, how did you first get involved?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.600
I'm not, well, lived in Carnival, lived in Carnival,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.560
lived in Cardiff since 1990.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.000
Had Alice in 1996, had been to a couple of carnivals

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.060
before she was born, as you know, party, party.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.380
And then, started going to carnival when she was little

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.860
to show her, so she was in a push chair and all wrapped up

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.140
because it was usually quite chilly.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.900
Sounds like Cardiff in the summer, doesn't it?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.940
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.780
And we used to go and we used to try and score a nice place

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.900
by wherever the end of the carnival was happening that year

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.300
so that we could see the entirety of the parade.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.000
Always impressed by the big things,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.920
the big strange, wonderful things that were on the parade.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.360
Big creations on backpacks.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.600
On backpacks and stilts and other things.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.280
Remember the Jumbies, Kevin and Oggy?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.360
No, I don't remember the names, you see,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.360
because I wasn't that involved.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.560
You just see the thing pass by and go,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.920
ooh, that's lovely and amazing and wonderful.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.680
And decided when she was about four or five,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.760
that I was gonna get involved,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.080
but when she was a bit older,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.960
because I thought taking a four or five year old

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.480
would be too much like hard work.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.240
And by the time she was eight,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.480
I thought she was capable enough

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.880
so she could go along and join in in her own right

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.680
rather than just be an appendage to her mother.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.920
So we went in and we joined in

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.920
and we started doing the printing of Rainbow People costumes.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.880
Lots of dots, little production line going on.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.800
Did that for about three days.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.040
And then the man, yeah, how many dots did you produce?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, enough of this.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.480
Millions, millions.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.320
Enough of this.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.600
They were quite pretty though.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.440
Absolutely.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.880
It was quite nice to do.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.520
And then didn't get actually to go on the carnival

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.680
because I broke my toe the weekend before.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.520
That's dashed bad luck as we say.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.800
So daddy had to join in

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.640
and daddy had to be a rainbow man.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.200
Mick was the rainbow man.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.680
I shall always think of him that way.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.440
Yes, I can get the photos to prove it.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.760
I think we're going to have to ask you

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.920
to share those with us so we can put those online

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.600
as part of the archive.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.920
You'll love me for that one.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.160
Absolutely.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.320
So the first costume that you and Alice performed

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.040
was part of a rainbow section.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.840
Well, we were part of the rainbow section.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.680
Of course Mick was.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.520
But Mick was, I didn't actually go in.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.440
Did Mick have time to learn a few moves?

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.960
I mean, how did he?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.840
I don't think he did to be honest.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.880
He facilitated Alice's enjoyment.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.440
And Tabitha, we always brought down Alice

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.800
or I always brought down Alice and a friend.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.200
It was usually Tabitha and Tabitha was, you know,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.280
a little rainbow girly.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.760
So your foot is now healed.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.720
I hasten to add that you didn't limp into this interview.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.320
You weren't permanently scarred by the carnival experience.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.520
I actually can't feel the tip of my toe

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.520
because of the break in my big toe.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.000
Even to this day, folks.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.840
You know.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.680
Yeah.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.080
Yeah, but I'm okay.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.920
I can still walk.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.920
It's a good sign.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.560
So you did the rainbow section.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.400
Take us through your story.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.320
What happened next?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.160
What happened next?

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.040
Next year,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.440
next year was the,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.240
it was the under the sea theme.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.720
And we did a lot of, of,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.040
tissueing on the big,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.080
there was like a sea serpent.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.920
Yeah, I remember.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.760
In sections.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.600
Yeah, very much so.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.920
And Alice and I did a lot of tissue paper on it,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.280
but we opted to be in the sea urchin.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.800
It was one of Lizzie's lovely little drawings of sea urchins.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.880
And we opted to be in the sea urchin drawings.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.240
Well, the sea urchin costumes didn't get made

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.160
right until the last minute.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.000
And we're actually a bit nervous.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.320
But we went in them anyway.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.640
We were very pink.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.960
They were little pink sea urchins with puffed wool

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.360
kind of skirts.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.440
And we had, yeah, that was, that was a kind of like,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.920
oh no, please don't come see me in this costume.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.320
Anyway, after that, the following year,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.000
I think was the year of,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.560
the theme was festivals from around the world.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.400
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.080
And we came in in the open evening and we saw,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.840
again, a Lizzie's illustration for Day of the Dead people.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.520
Oh, excellent, the Mexican Day of the Dead, yes.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.360
Mexican Day of the Dead.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.960
And we went, and Alice was just sort of at 10,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.560
kind of proto-Goth mode.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.960
She went into Goth mode at the beginning of high school,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.320
you know, for a couple of years, but she was kind of-

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.160
Great tradition.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.560
Yeah, she was into skulls and other things like that.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.400
And she just saw it and went,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.560
yes, I want to be one of those.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.960
And I felt, right, fine.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.960
And by this time, I knew the staff better

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.000
and said, you know, could we have a go at building

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.760
three big skulls and-

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.960
Yes, I remember.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.760
Having, being independent in our own little-

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.120
Yeah, and wonderfully big skeletal hands as well.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.880
Yes, they did have, it's strange,

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.480
because we were thinking of revisiting it next year,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.000
because it would have been her 20th birthday.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.200
Oh, wow, her birthday.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.760
So it would have been from 10 to 20, 10 years on to do the-

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.800
Right.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.800
But we probably won't get the opportunity now,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.480
because it won't be here.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.880
Sadly, this is a strong likelihood,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.720
is all I can say at this joke show.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.880
I think we'll just have to make them

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.760
and walk around the streets with them for fun.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.400
Because they were the best costumes.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.080
I still maintain they were the best costumes to wear

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.920
that we've ever made.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.760
Excellent.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.560
Because they had our faces in the middle

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.440
of the big gaping mouth so that people could see,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.680
even though we were covered in black face paint

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.840
and meant to paint.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.320
I remember the heads themselves being really quite big.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.160
Yeah, they were.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.320
How big would you guess to make them were?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.960
I suppose mine was about three foot,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.760
maybe a little bit bigger across.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.600
These were very big.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.000
And maybe four foot deep.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.840
But they were so light,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.320
because you- Yeah, they were on backpacks

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.160
above our heads.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.800
I mean, I can remember you dancing them,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.760
you never seemed to stop.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.960
And the hands, having sort of poles

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.960
with the skeletal arm and hands on to the arms,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.360
you could actually- Last girl puppets, obviously.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.200
Would you describe those puppets?

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.080
They felt like puppets.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.720
Yeah, they were the first puppets, really,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.560
that we made.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.840
And it was the girls, particularly,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.080
little 10-year-old girls in big skull heads

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.080
going out to the audience.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.680
They were very interactive.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.480
In most things that cover your face,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.720
the public have a problem with dealing with the puppet,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.400
because it's sort of like, where is the human being in this?

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.800
If your face is completely covered,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.280
then people sometimes are a bit wary of it.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.800
Yes, it's not as welcoming, is it?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.760
No, it's not as wary.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.160
Whereas if they could see the faces

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.680
and see the delight and glee on little girls' faces

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.680
as they were poking you with a skeletal finger

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.560
to try and frighten you, then, yeah,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.840
they got a big reaction and they got a positive reaction

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.640
because people were acting scared

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.760
in order to get the reaction from the girls.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.600
Can you remember, musically,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.000
what band you were near in that parade?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.280
I haven't a clue.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.880
Probably Samba of some sort.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.720
Samba of some sort, yeah.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.080
That normally does it, it was fun.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.960
And we had sort of ponchos and things to-

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.240
No, we definitely got images on the archive of those.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.640
They were wonderful.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.480
They were fun.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.080
So you started on the puppet road.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.280
What was your next carnival adventure after that?

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.120
Gosh.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.640
This is, I can't remember 11.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.360
I think 11, when she was 11, was a year we missed,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.200
and I can't remember why.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.160
I think it could have been a family holiday.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.440
You know, mistimed.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.520
Yeah.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.160
But when she was 12, we did the,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.520
they were the cat spirits.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.680
She had, it was the first costume

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.200
that Alice had designed herself.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.680
Right, that's something.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.320
And because she was beginning to pester me

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.680
about what we're gonna do, what we're gonna do,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.560
and I sat down, piece of paper, right.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.000
Whatever you want, you draw it, we'll make it.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.840
Oh, wow.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.040
And so she drew the first, and I don't know why,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.520
she's not, we did have a cat,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.920
but she wasn't particularly fond of it.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.640
She's never been fond of animals.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.400
So she drew this sort of cat-like creature

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.440
with, hers had a big splash.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.080
Yes, and had very big eyes.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.280
Very beautiful eyes, yes.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.720
Touch of Japanese manga comics in there.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.120
I have no idea where they're.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.720
Well, I think they're very beautiful.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.360
And just for me, there was an echo

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.480
of a Japanese style cartoon called Manga.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.000
By the eyes, definitely. Big eyes, definitely.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.560
And she drew hers first,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.440
and she decided it was the spirit, the water,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.680
no, the cat spirit of water.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.520
Right, yeah.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.440
If, as if. Or spit, as we think of it.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.040
As if there is such a thing.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.880
Hello, after all, is there?

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.080
And then we sold the idea to Tabitha,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.120
who was gonna do it with us.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.320
Excellent. And she came up with the,

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.680
she was gonna be the night sky,

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.720
and hers went up to a point.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.120
They were almost like onions, the shape initially.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.960
Interesting shapes.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.480
Yeah, Alice's went wide at the top,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.080
and Tabitha's went up to a point

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.080
that then came over with little stars dangling from it,

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.280
and it was midnight blue with,

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.320
so Alice's was blue because it was water,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.680
and Tabitha's was the deep dark blue

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.800
with lots of little silver bits and stars on it.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.440
And then I decided I was going to be

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.960
the cat spirit of nature.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.240
And mine was like a big gourd shape.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.280
It had a twisty bit at the top,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.200
and was green and yellow and orange with the big.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.760
Hey, that's a sort of vegetable-like thing

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.240
going in there somewhere. Yes, yeah, it was weird.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.080
It was weird. No, no, yeah.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.080
They were just slightly surreal.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.120
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.480
They weren't as friendly to wear

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.840
because we didn't have,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.360
our faces were completely covered.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.200
Yes, yeah.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.000
And when you stare at somebody

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.720
through a giant cat head's eyes,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.360
they kind of look at you as if you've gone off your trolley.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.200
Yeah.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.240
Mom, make it go away.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.160
Yeah, what's going on here?

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.000
Not quite good.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.360
Not as accessible as the skull heads.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.200
The skulls, no, no.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.960
So after the cat heads,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.760
now we're up to, oh,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.920
what do we do after that?

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.720
Gosh.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.080
I know there was one that Alice,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.120
I think that was the, no,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.240
because if that was 10, 11, 12,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.080
maybe it was 13, she fell off that.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.920
I wish I could see the pictures

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.080
because Mick's got all the archive of the pictures.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.080
Right, right, right.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.240
And it's easier to go through,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.080
but I can't remember exactly which one comes next.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.600
Well, let's fast forward to the summer

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.680
because I think we've just gone

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.240
because of course, you know.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.080
Yes.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.080
Possibly our most ambitious and most stressful so far.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.720
No, but on my side, you were there every day.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.080
Every day for 17 days in a row and then some.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.600
Yeah.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.080
Yeah, so I mean, you know.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.440
It's the one opportunity a year you get

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.920
to just go for it and make something huge

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.320
and out there and, you know, most of the time,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.440
if you're making something,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.280
you're making it on a domestic scale within your own home.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.200
And so, you know, it can't be that big.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.960
You wouldn't be able to live with it if it was that big.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.880
Or get it through the door.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.520
Yeah, it wouldn't all get it through the door.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.280
You know, so the things you make, you know,

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.200
and I do make stuff.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.440
I mean, usually it's jewelry or stuff like that.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.920
It's small, itty bitty stuff.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.760
Yeah, yeah.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.080
And I paint as well, so I do that,

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.880
but it's not a chance to do just go for it and be creative

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.240
and not worry about having to pay for materials

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.120
and not worry about any of the, you know,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.440
serious logistics of it.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.040
It's sort of like Adrian's great in that he comes along

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.760
and he goes, hmm, yeah, sure, go ahead.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.240
Is that how the conversation goes?

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.360
Usually, usually it's sort of like he'll,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.840
when he doesn't know, he just looks at you and goes,

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.880
you'll figure it out.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.600
And you have to, and you always do.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.560
I mean, you always seem to triumph.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.280
Well, I didn't get it to walk, which is...

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.160
Oh, describe it before we go any further.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.000
It was a 14 foot high, naked woman.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.400
Excellent.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.600
Called Delilah Furiosa.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.400
I haven't seen the Mad Max film,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.960
which is Furiosa Roaned or something like that.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.800
It's the current one, isn't it?

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.960
Yeah, Alice has seen it.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.160
And described that she comes home from these films

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.520
and she sits and spends about an hour relating every detail

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.880
of the plot. So I don't have to go.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.320
So yes, she was Delilah Furiosa.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.320
She had moving joints from her neck

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.880
to her shoulders, elbows, even all her finger joints worked,

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.320
but I couldn't get them to move.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.160
That was another frustrating thing.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.400
They were too far up.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.400
There was too much translation of, you know,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.360
the string had to move too far to get it.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.960
So you had to pull it too much.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.800
And you know...

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.080
But you can see the steps you've made from the relative

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.920
simple mix of them.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.240
Now there's how many joints in your creation?

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.360
Way too many.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.720
The year, actually it could have been that year.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.560
That could have been...

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.240
Well, anyway, I'll go back to them.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.240
The year that Ben and Jude came to do the giant things

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.600
that were made that year.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.720
I think from that moment on, they were,

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.200
Ben and Jude were fantastic.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.600
They were just completely inspirational.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.520
And so they came in and did this wonderful workshop

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.440
and just went, make giant puppets.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.280
And I went, ooh!

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.440
Now that's a good idea.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.880
So from that moment on, it's been how many moving bits

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.760
can I get into it?

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.360
And so, yes, we ended up with Delilah Furiosa.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.760
Who's on a backpack and...

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.920
She wasn't on a backpack, she was on a trolley.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.280
Oh, of course, yeah, yeah, indeed.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.480
She was too big to be on a backpack.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.640
I did contemplate having her on a backpack

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.120
because she wasn't that heavy in the end.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.440
It was just that I would have appeared to be

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.320
as if she'd given birth to me.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.440
There was a dilemma about finding yourself suspended

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.240
between a giant woman's legs, now you mention it.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.360
Yeah, it just didn't seem a comfortable place to be.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.480
I can understand that.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.880
So we did put her on the trolley.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.320
And mostly willows and withy sticks and paint her

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.800
and colored and then painted, varnished,

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.720
yeah.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.560
She was mostly withy.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.840
There was some carbon fiber pole in,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.160
there was some bamboo in the basic structure,

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.960
but it was all covered in...

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.360
And you had some rather wonderful sayings

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.400
painted onto her.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.560
Feminist slogans.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.400
Yes.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.240
Yes.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.880
Can you, Larry, for the record?

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.720
She had,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.480
We Are Not Things written on her tummy.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.240
She's had women hold up half the world.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.640
She's a Chinese prophet.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.200
And I can't remember what was on the other arm.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.320
There was a women reclaim the night.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.160
Yeah.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.000
From all the reclaim the night marches.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.160
And there was...

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.800
Which is quite a political statement, you know.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.640
Yeah, no.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.960
And Carnival has a point for that.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.880
What kind of reaction did you get from the public?

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.000
From, yeah.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.840
Interesting.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.680
Yes.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.720
Because a lot of women were cheering.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.560
Excellent.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.880
A lot of women, a lot of men kind of slightly more reserved.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.160
There was a guy who came up to grope her bum

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.960
as he walked, as she walked past him.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.800
Yeah.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.880
And I just looked at him because I was on the arm.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.480
Actually, no, I was pushing at this point.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.480
So it was behind the arm person and in between.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.040
And he went up to grope her bum and I said, no consent.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.360
And he walked away.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.200
Brilliant, brilliant.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.640
That was a, wow.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.280
That's a very telling, excellent.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.960
It was interesting.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.240
But there were people who walked up and went,

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.840
actually one of the people from the band,

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.360
I can't remember what he said he was called,

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.040
one of the bands came up and said,

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.280
I have two daughters, I'm so glad you've done this.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.840
It really means a lot.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.200
You know, and he was absolutely gushing.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.040
Yeah, no, no.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.200
And I was quite taken aback by it because it was,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.600
you know, people don't tend to get emotional

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.440
about these things.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.280
No, no, no.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.400
But he was really heartfelt in that he thought

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.200
it was a fantastic thing to do.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.040
That's amazing.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.880
Yeah.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.720
Oh, dear, dear.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.680
So positive and negative.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.240
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.360
But it was, it was the first time I think

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.000
I've been out there politically.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.840
Right, right, right.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.800
I hadn't done anything that I...

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.840
And of course, while you're working,

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.880
Alice, your daughter is there alongside you,

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.320
but with her own visions now.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.320
With my own.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.160
Separate.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.000
Yeah, with her own creation.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.640
This year, she had, she came up with the idea ages ago,

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.760
it must have been at least six months before the carnival,

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.600
that she wanted to do an octopus

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.360
but its legs moved up.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.520
And she came up with the idea that if she put it

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.080
on an umbrella, which had eight spikes,

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.920
then she could make this.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.840
And the only problem being is that umbrellas

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.760
aren't made that, with that much fortitude.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.120
And during the process of making the creature...

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.440
How many umbrellas died in the making of the show?

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.280
At least two.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.120
Oh, really?

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.960
And each time it was a major trauma.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.880
Oh.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.240
And she was so near the end of her tether

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.640
because she wanted it...

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.760
It's like she can make,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.680
she knows she can make things that are beautiful.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.520
Yes.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.360
But she has, was making...

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.760
She knows one end of a glue gun from another.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.680
She does.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.720
But she didn't, she wanted to prove

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.520
that she could have make something

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.520
that was puppet-like, like I do.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.360
Kinetic.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.280
Yes, kinetic sculpture.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.120
Yes.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.280
And that she wanted to do something that was naturalistic

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.200
in that it was like the creature

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.880
that she was attempting to create.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.840
It wasn't just she was trying to make a pretty thing

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.160
that looked like an octopus,

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.480
but it had to move like an octopus.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.480
And so we had several points

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.600
at which she was at the point of,

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.520
I can't do this in a bloody umbrella.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.360
It didn't...

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.960
Blah, blah, blah.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.400
And at one stage when I was trying to get mine to walk

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.280
and she was trying to get hers to flap its tentacles

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.560
at people, we've had a point where we've just hugged

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.160
each other and burst into tears.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.160
And the people all around us were kind of edging slowly away.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.920
Cardinal trauma alert,

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.080
Cardinal trauma alert.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.000
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.480
It's sort of like, yeah, okay.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.000
So it's got a bit tense and emotional.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.840
Don't worry about it.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.680
It goes carry on.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.520
No, no, absolutely.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.840
We'll sequel it in the morning.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.680
Yes, yeah.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.240
In fact, she had a friend with her

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.480
who made a rather extraordinary sort of,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.560
well, yeah, I'll let you describe it.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.400
The teacup.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.240
The teacup.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.080
This is the new one.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.920
Why did that come from?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.880
Well, Katrin's only been doing it since last year.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.280
Right.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:11.120
And Katrin came along last year and was,

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.640
she's quite a creative person

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.000
but hadn't done anything before.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.760
Wanted to do her own backpack.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.600
And so decided last year she was going to be

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.080
that Lego character, the Unikitty.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.920
Yes.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.080
Unikitty, well, Katrin, Kat, Kitty.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:29.920
Yeah.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.200
It's totally logical.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.880
And so she made this fairly simple structure

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.840
but beautifully decorated and everybody loved it.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.520
Unikitty, Unikitty all the way around.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.840
Unikitty, Unikitty.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.240
And so thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.600
Came back this year.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.120
Went through several incarnations of what she wanted to be.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.280
But decided in the end she wanted to be

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.680
an Alastin Wonderland themed teacup and saucer.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.320
Yes, extraordinary.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.880
Or rather the cat peering out

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.640
of an Alastin Wonderland themed teacup and saucer.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.560
Brilliant colors.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.880
I mean, it's a psychedelic character.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.840
It was absolutely psychedelic.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.680
Yeah.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.680
And also when the structure itself was slightly asymmetrical

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.320
rather than getting het up about this,

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.560
went, oh, obviously that's the way it's meant to be

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.640
and made a very asymmetrical saucer

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.040
to go with a very asymmetrical cup

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.840
as a handle.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.680
Yeah, I think I've added to it.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.520
Yeah, it did, it did.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.360
There was movement in it.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.200
Yeah, yeah.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.040
And so.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.160
That's how I carry cups of tea upstairs, you know.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.000
Yes, yeah.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.720
So I never seem to make it in one.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.240
And didn't want to be sort of in amongst a group.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.640
Had enjoyed the attention.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.640
Yeah, Unikitty, so, you know.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.480
Yeah, I know.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.320
The attention of, yeah.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.680
So, but yeah.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.880
They're a strange band.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.960
Well, I mean, you know, you've been a wonderful

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.240
and as I say, virtually on a daily basis,

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.680
permanent feature of carnival camps for a long time.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.320
If you had to speak to future generations

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.960
and try and sum up the atmosphere of the carnival camp,

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.800
how would you describe it?

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.200
What's going on around you as you, over time?

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.560
What sort of, what's it feel like?

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.280
What did it feel like?

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.240
It's usually the camaraderie.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.240
This year, doing the feminist thing.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.080
Yeah, excellent.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.800
Wearing my hair shirt in public.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.960
Absolutely.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.640
Has been wonderful.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.160
The reaction to a naked woman statue.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.760
Yeah, the parade through the middle of Cardiff, yay!

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.520
But during the making of her, in the workshops,

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.280
you know, when I'm sculpting a bottom or breasts.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.120
Yes, yes.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.960
Then the reaction of, I mean, there are,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.680
I would say predominantly women to men on most camps.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.520
No, no, gender-wise.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.160
Yeah, gender-wise, that's the split.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.000
But definitely the room we were in was predominantly women.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.840
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.120
And just coming over and touching and feeling

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.280
and suggesting and, you know, all the comments

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.280
and being incredibly positive from a body positive sort of.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.440
Yes.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.280
You know, she wasn't as...

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.120
I remember you showing me some,

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.200
is it some pre-Columbian artifacts?

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.560
Yeah, the little Venus statues.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.400
Yes.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.880
Because the idea arrived in my head.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.680
She wasn't of the...

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.800
I wanted her to...

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.960
The little Venus statues are really almost spherical.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.800
Yes.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.640
And their breasts are so abnormally large

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.000
and their hips are so abnormally wide.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.800
Curve upon curve upon curve.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.840
And they don't know why they made them

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.400
because they're prehistoric.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.520
They've obviously got no text about these figures.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.800
And there's two suggestions,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.440
one that they are fertility symbols

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.680
or that they were given to women during birth

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.320
to hold onto.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.160
Interesting.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.000
As, you know, as symbols of female strength

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.080
or female abilities.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.400
So yeah, it came via that kind of feeling

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.560
and it was all about how...

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.360
And also there's a song by Kimia Dawson

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.840
who's an American folk singer,

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.480
really short black woman who...

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.320
Oh.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.160
Oh.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.520
I was telling you about Kimia Dawson

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.360
who was an American folk singer.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.200
Yeah.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.720
Who was also part of the inspiration

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.560
for the giant woman sculpture that I made

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.360
because she wrote a song called I Like Giants,

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.080
especially female giants.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:35.920
Yeah.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.240
And it has the line in it,

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.600
all women feel too big sometimes regardless of their size.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.440
Oh, nice.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.960
And it's how women are put in, you know,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.360
made to be little than made to feel small.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.080
Absolutely.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.600
And made to want to be small.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.440
Absolutely.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.280
Yeah.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.120
So that was part of the influence.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.920
And yeah, Delilah Furiosa arrived in my head,

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.880
almost fully formed with the Aboriginal hand painting

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.600
on her legs and the starry, starry...

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.440
It's beautiful art.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.320
Really beautiful.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.320
Starry, starry night and sunset.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.160
Yeah.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.000
All fully formed.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.840
Yeah.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.760
So I don't know quite where she arrived from,

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.520
but once she'd arrived in my head, she had to be made.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.080
I say, I mean, you're one of the people

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.600
who approach carnival with a macro hat on,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.160
you always make big statements.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.360
And of course, two that come to mind is your...

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.600
Was the hair a Mad March hair or not?

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.480
It wasn't a Mad March hair.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.360
It was...

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.200
It certainly wasn't a rabbit.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.040
It wasn't a rabbit.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.440
It was definitely a hair.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.280
It was the year after...

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.680
You can tell by the elongated body.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.040
Yeah, it was the year after Ben and Jude came.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.800
And it was, I want to build a puppet,

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.080
a thing with moving bits on it and in it.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.400
I want to be put in it, inside it as part of the creature.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.120
And I think because of the way they worked,

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.560
I started building a skeleton first.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.160
And I worked from the inside

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.000
and then I built the hair outside it

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.760
and skinned it with the hair.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.120
And that, but Delilah Furiosa,

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.280
I worked the other way round.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.240
I worked with the idea of the skeleton in mind,

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.800
but I made the...

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.640
Because...

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.200
She was all bum, belly and bust.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.720
Yeah, she was all bum, belly and bust.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.760
And I wanted her to be sort of in proportion

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.240
as a human figure, because the human figure,

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.320
the thing that if you look through carnivals

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.960
all over the world, the thing that gets most distorted,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.240
if they make large figures, is the human figure.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.640
It just doesn't work on some level,

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.120
because it's not in proportion to itself.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.880
So I worked the other way around, which was not ideal.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.720
But...

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.400
It's been a process of trying to learn.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.640
Exactly, you never learn.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.680
It's creativity.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.520
Yes.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.280
And yeah, and then after the hair,

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.880
the hair was lovely to be inside, actually.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.600
It was a slightly drizzly day, so I kept dry.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.040
And got a lovely reaction from the public.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.040
It's legs had a realistic movement

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.960
and its paws had a realistic movement.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.320
And so I could go and lean a paw on somebody's shoulder.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.160
That was quite sweet.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.440
I think your interaction with the audience

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.840
has always been one of the loveliest points.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:14.680
Yeah, yeah.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.760
And it makes for a very bespoke appearance.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.360
Nobody else is gonna have that.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.200
No.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.040
You know.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.880
Mommy, are you there?

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.720
Mommy.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.280
And I'm stopping for lots of pictures,

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.640
which does hold other people up and they get, you know.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.480
No, no, but...

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.840
You have to have patient people behind you.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.240
Absolutely, but I mean, I think people actually vote

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.680
with their mobile phones now, don't they?

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.880
If they want a picture, they want a picture.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.000
Yeah, this is true.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.720
And you know, we've always made a point of saying,

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.400
please, you know, play with the public, you know.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:44.400
And then I went to make a puppet lizard.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.640
Yeah.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.040
And I wanted the mouth.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.880
I wanted to, ideally...

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.040
Wasn't a touch of chameleon about him or not?

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.640
Was a touch of chameleon about him.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.720
Nothing, good.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.560
Eddie lizard.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.480
Of the chameleon future generations.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.640
Eddie lizard, very pretty.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.320
Eddie lizard.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.960
He was supposed to be over an arm, but...

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.320
But I chose to clad him in latex,

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.280
and latex is really heavy.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.440
Even in thin layers, it's quite,

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.880
made him too heavy to go one-sided.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.840
Otherwise I'd have ended up walking around

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.480
with the puppet dragon on the floor.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.600
He was that limpy round the carnival side, hooray.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.480
So in the end, he went above my head

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.520
and I had to create a little pull mechanism

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.360
to make the jaws.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.560
Beautiful, beautiful colors.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.240
Yeah, very vivid and neon colors.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.920
Yeah, really exciting, really exciting.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.120
And he had a lovely slinky tail.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.840
My favorite bit of him was the slinky tail.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.880
Like, you know, those little mini silver fishes

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.880
that you can get that have rings of lessening cones.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.920
And joined together at the top of the bottom,

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.520
and that's how the tail.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.360
It was lovely.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.040
It was lovely being able to walk along

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.560
and slink the tail behind you,

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.120
and the tail would come all the way around

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:04.960
and curve around the body.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.800
It was lovely.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.760
It was lovely to wear.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.520
Well, I think we've had a fairly good,

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.080
and what can I say, lighthearted Rob

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.320
through well over 10 years of carnival contributions.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.520
It's at this point that I say thank you very much,

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.520
Nikki, for all you've given to Cardiff Carnival.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.960
And hereby give you the completely unbankable,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.600
but nonetheless worthy title of carnival hero.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.920
Nikki, thank you very much indeed.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.760
Pleasure.
