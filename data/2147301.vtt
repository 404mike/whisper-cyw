00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you don't want to be do you just say the big audio only. Oh, it's totally up to you.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I can just patch it to the audio only. Okay, that's fine.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I've got the whole file.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Audio only.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Okay, so first up

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Could you tell me

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
My name is Mohammed by the way. I come from a

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Project called Urban Circle. We're based in the University of South Wales. I'm volunteering here today

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
with Roy, just to give my time for the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
interviews. Could you just give me your place of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
your name

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and where you are from.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Originally where I'm from. My name is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Zia Ahmed.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm from Pakistan.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Could you tell me more about where you're from then. So tell me

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
whereabouts in Pakistan and what was it like

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
where you were born. I'm from

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Faisalabad and I was born

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in a village where my mum's mum lived.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We used to visit there all our

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
childhood until she was alive.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
My dad was a contractor.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So wherever his work when we

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
was little we travelled with him. We travelled different parts of the country.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
When we grown up of the age of going to

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
colleges we settled down in Faisalabad.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Our village where my dad's lands and everything was near

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Faisalabad and my old dad's family

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
lived there. We were living in

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
city. I had my

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
GCSE level education

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
in Faisalabad. Then

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
when I went to college it was still in Faisalabad but it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
was in city. So I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
did internet, FA

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Faculty of Arts and then after that I did

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
a BA.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I'm one of my eight brothers and sisters, big family.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I went to college

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
obviously we had friends.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We had a very good time, good teachers.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
When I finished my education I did just the housework

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
learn life skills

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
with my mum. My older sister

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I was the second on second place in my

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
family. My older sister was married then I was the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
head of the house like mum gave all responsibilities to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
me.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I was doing quite well all of it. My brothers

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
was all younger. We are three sisters they are older.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Then I have five brothers.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We were teaching them going to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
their schools to take care of them. My dad was usually

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
wherever his work is his projects are he's usually

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
there. We did whatever was our duty

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
my duty, take care of the family and mum.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Then

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
all my aunties uncles was around nearby

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
we used to visit them their children come to stay with us.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Friends was obviously we have a good time with friends.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
After when I was

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
twenty four I had engagement

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
he was from here his mum

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
went to Pakistan and it was arranged

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
then my husband went there and we met each other

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
then when I was twenty five I got married

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and come to this country and then life start.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Before we get to that because that will be my next

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
question. What was it like growing up

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in Faisalabad? How did it feel? Were you a joyful

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
kid? Were you responsible?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Elder? Tell me about what it was like growing up.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
What fond memories do you have of it?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It was just average family

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
average lifestyle. Though our parents

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
tried to provide whatever they can but I can't say

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
it was a very lavish

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
life it was just middle class

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
life. But we enjoy our life

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
there wasn't any desires of more than what we got.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Whatever they provide us wasn't more than enough

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
for us.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
In those days there not used to be this trend of going for holidays

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the holidays was usually visiting grandparents

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
or aunties or uncles and having a good time with them.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Even my grandmother used to play

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
with us all the board games and things like that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Obviously we all brothers

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and sisters played with our dolls. Sisters we play with the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
dolls and brothers they go out and play

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
their games. Tell me about the games

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
you played then. This is actually one of the key questions was about

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
what did you do to pass the time and have fun?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
All girls get together and

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
it was a different type of we used to play

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I don't know what they call it. Draw on the ground.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
We say shatapu in our life.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Jump on one throw a stone and then wherever it falls

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
we jump and hop with one leg and then

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
two legs and something like that. The other game we used to play

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
so long time now even forgot

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
what we used to play. All girls sit in a

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
circle like a tag game.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
They tag one person and then they have to run after that person

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and they throw something like we make a roll of the scarf

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and walk around slowly, drop behind one girl

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and if she feel there is

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
something behind she have to hold the things and run after other girls

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
if she forget she didn't feel there is anything behind. The same girl

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
come and pick and then they hit her. Something like that

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and then we used to play with the mud

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
like stones

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I don't know what they call it but we used to play and then

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
these little board games like snake and ladder

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
things like that. How about school? Do you remember school and did you have

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
a joyful class or something you remember from school? Yes, yes

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I was in sports as well

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I used, I was in school time

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I was in all sort of athletics like long jump

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I had quite a few

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
awards in a long jump and I was

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
playing netball as well. I was in a team

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I never went outside but in the college

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
time I was in a team as well and study wise I was

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
not very high but

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
upper high level. I had

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
good grades in my education

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and up to school time I was

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
on the top level but when I went into college

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
for FA I had like a first division

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and in BA it was a second division

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
but upper second division

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I wanted to study further but parents had no thus enough

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and then start teaching. I had a few different

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
courses in agriculture university in Faisalabad

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
they used to run in holidays

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
cooking, cookery courses, baking

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
so I had quite a few of those courses

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
just for my own life

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
My hobby from since I was little was

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
stitching. When my mom used to go out

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
to visit someone I just take some clothes

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
out and cut the clothes. I was very little, I was in fifth

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
grade and I used to cut them and stitch them and sew them

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
because when mom is home she won't let me do it. I was so

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
young but that was my hobby and still the same

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
it developed. Stitching

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
embroidery, knitting, these were the things in our times

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and there was no internet, no

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
television when we was quite old. We had television

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and used to watch

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
radio, we used to listen radios. How about traditions and celebrations?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Do you remember traditions you had?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Yes there was traditions about

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Eids, we celebrate Eids. It was very

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
exciting time when we all get ready

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
for the next day, all our jewellery, clothes and

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
brother's clothes and everything, clean the house

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
cook different foods and that was

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
the main thing

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
mainly we celebrate with the family

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and then visit aunties and uncles and they give money to each

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
other. That was the, there wasn't many

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
other traditions like Hindu people have

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Indian have many traditions, not many in our peoples

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
only the weddings like the Mehendi and

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
then the Shaudi weddings. There wasn't

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
things like in these days

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
it was very simple. Weddings were

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
simple.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Ok then lets talk about travelling. When did you arrive in the UK

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and what was the motive? What was the reason to

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
come over to the UK? Because I

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
had engagement and my motive was

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to come here to get married. Though

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I had a wedding ceremony in my country

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
but I travelled to this country as a fiance because it was more

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
easier to come as a fiance here on those days

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
laws change after and then I came here and

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
the ceremony was here as well.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It was in 79

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
July 22nd I came here

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and how old were you then? I was 25.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
So you arrived here when you were 25. Yes. Did you have any, what was your

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
expectations, what was your anxieties

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
what were your feelings? I haven't had any anxiety actually

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I was so confident. When I arrive

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
to the airport usually

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
in those days they call the boy in to have his interview

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and then they ask questions and everything

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and with me when I came to the airport

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
nothing happened like that because all other girls who came

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
in the same flight they were calling them and my husband

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and his family was outside and they were waiting for the call

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
that he will go in and give his interview but they ask everything

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
from me and I answer them

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and then they ask me to sit over there sometime

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I was sitting there and I asked where shall I go now

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and in the same time they called me for

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
interpreting for other people's I was doing interpreting for

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
them perhaps we had a little bonding with those people

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and then I asked do I have to sit here all the time now or how long I have to

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
sit they said no you can go there I go now and they said go through

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
this way and I was out.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So when you arrived what was the UK like?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
You got off the plane and then in the airport you got out the door

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
very easily by the sounds of it. What did you remember?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
When I was one of my dad's friends

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
was on the airport to receive me with

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
his family and then we came out and

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
drive to Newport

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
it was nice around outside

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
because weather was good not as

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
good it was quite cold in those days in October

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and when I come to the house though they had

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
quite now I think it was quite reasonable house

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
but that time it was too small for me

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and I don't know how I felt

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
but it seems strange everything

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
was strange

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and in what ways was it strange?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Because all people was new to me

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I only met his mother before and him

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
according to the law of this country

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
I had the nikah on the same time same night

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
priest was there and close family members was there

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and the nikah happened

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and I have

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I was quite calm that time wasn't anxious or anything

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So what were the first six months like then?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
If the first meeting was hard what was the first six months like?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Six months yes that was quite different

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
than the family I come from

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and I wasn't expecting because these people when they go

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
back to Pakistan they flatter a lot

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
this is there and we got this and we got that

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
but all I was disappointed

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
because obviously in your family may be the same

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
the life is like this perhaps

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
my husband's family they come from a village for them

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
they may be a lot but because I had everything

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
more than these things in my house over there

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
there wasn't any excitement

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
about those things which is a basic

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
household things and like that

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So what was the most important thing you had to leave behind then?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Looking back on those six months let's say two in a year

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
what do you feel you left behind that you really could have missed?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
It's the parents and my family

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I used to miss my mother because in those days

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
people wasn't traveling back

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
very quickly in this state

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
first time I went back was five years

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
obviously we missed parents and friends

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
it's not easy to make when you're staying home

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
you can't make many friends easily

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
So okay then let's extend that time first two years

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
what were the best things and what were the worst things?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
My husband was very very

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
supportive and he wasn't like

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
making any he never said anything

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
whatever he is he was very

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
honest with me

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
that was the big support for me we lived with the family

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
and obviously in laws are in laws

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
they pick on every little things

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I'm sleeping late I'm waking up late if we wake up

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
early it's no good things like that

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
clean the house do this which we never used to

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
but I did it all I know we have to do everything

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
but slowly slowly I learned many things from my mother in law as well

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
because

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
then I had my daughter

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
two years later

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
but I start working after about

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
seven eight months I went out and find a job whatever I can

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
find and I start working

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
what was it like when you first moved into what was it like?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
My in laws house

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
they had a big reasonable house five bedroom

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
but the decoration it was

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
up to living standard better than

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
normal people who was living here in those days it was better than theirs

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
they had all facilities like washing machine and

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
telephone in those days telephone was very few people used to have

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
a phone in their house because all their my

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
husband and his brothers they was all in universities

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
and all that so they knew all these things

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
and they tried to provide their parents though my father in law

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
was very illiterate but he was very sensible

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
and he tried to control everything even if

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
my sometimes my mother in law she little bit harsh

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
to me he tried to calm her down and

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
give us a comfort as well he was very nice and kind person

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
so everything was sort of okay

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
So how about culturally food wise

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
when you arrived here what was the stark

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
difference did you notice anything or what could you say about that?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Obviously you feel taste and food

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
different here when you first come

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
especially milk was

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
taste different meat was taste different from back home

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
and slowly slowly we adopt

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
we used to it water taste was even different

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
in Mumbai?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
I don't know it was taste was different

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
like from one place to the other if you go

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
from here to Manchester water taste is different it was similar

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
it was coming here and it was different to me

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
and food was totally different taste

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
What was your first job like? I work in a factory they used to

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
make a blinds

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Tell me more about that job did you enjoy it?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
It was a necessity that time coming out of the house

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
and be independent and I was thinking if

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
because when I came here my husbands graduation was

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
after I was here I went to his graduation so he hasn't had any job before

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
and he

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
he start working and I start working so I can help each other

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
we can help each other and buy our own house

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
something

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
I was fully support to my husband and he support to me

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
he never hide anything from me even though sometimes

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
parents say don't tell this to your wife or anything but he was very honest

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
he said no I can't do that he was very respectful

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
to his parents as well but he was very

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
honest with me and throughout my life he was very supportive

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Maintaining links back home what did you do to maintain

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
connection and the cultural practices what habits did you

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
inform or what did you do to try and maintain some link with back home?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Write a letter

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
sometime we make book a call in those days

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
we have to book a call and talk to my parents

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
mostly writing letters

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
What kind of thing did you talk about in your letters?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
I never told them if I have a little bit hard time here

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
I never told my parents anything about that

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
and I was thinking that's the normal thing it can happen if I was in Pakistan

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
so I tell them if they can't do anything about it

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
so those things I never told them

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
the other things I'm doing this and asking

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
them how they are doing and that's all

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
I was writing letters so they feel comfortable about me

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
So as part of this project the people's collection is the website and has

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
space for multimedia work as well so it means if you have

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
original letters or photographs or monuments

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
or anything like that they can be scanned to place with your story

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Do you have anything that may be of interest to preserve for the future?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
What type of photograph?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Anything that feels good with your story it's up to you but the idea is it will be professionally

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
scanned they have professional scanners that come and they do it very high resolution

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
After I came to this country or before my Pakistan photographs

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
I think anything is your opinion

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I don't have any opinion here it's about if you want to add anything that's beyond audio

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
and transcription if you want to add anything to your story

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
so people are doing their wedding photograph or they're doing their picture of their mother

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
or whoever it may be and we attach it to the story

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
so when people read or listen they get to see a picture or photograph

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
It's up to you

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
I have photographs and I have to dig into it

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
It's a big box of photographs

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
I'm going to write photos available question mark so we'll get your contact details

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
as they go through the process they may call you and say would you like to add something

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
and they'll book a day where you can bring them in and the professional will come and they set up the cameras

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
and stuff like that to do high resolution scanners

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
What would you like to pass on to your children, grandchildren, great great great grandchildren

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
that would sum up your life here in the UK?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I'd say great great great great great far far away

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
and they're doing some research and they type the family name in

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
my great great great great great grandmother lives in Newport

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
what would you like to say and leave them about you living here?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Yes the best thing I will tell them about the faith

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Live the life whichever way they feel comfortable

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
but don't stop practicing

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
and your faith

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
We are Muslim, we should stay Muslim

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
and die as a Muslim, it doesn't matter

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
we are Muslim, we should stay Muslim

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
and die as a Muslim, it doesn't matter how many generations passed

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
that's the main thing

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Is there anything you would like to tell them about the way you lived your life

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
or how you encouraged them to live their life

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
as well, the faith is an important part

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
any morals or principles or cultures or ethos

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
or philosophies?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Respect parents

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
and

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
love and care is the main thing and respect

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
with their parents and with their

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
siblings, with their brothers and sisters

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
family, if they stick with their family, if their family is together

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
they are stronger

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
We already had some questions

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
when did you find out about Age Alive?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
About 7 years ago

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
What has it meant for you?

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Coming out of house, seeing more friends, trying to find out more

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
about the people's lives and share my own experiences

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
with them

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
It's very relaxing when you come out of house and talk to people

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
and share your happiness and whatever happened to you

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
It's a very supportive group

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
even if somebody is ill or somebody passed away

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
they are very supportive

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
or any happiness, any weddings, any functions, any get togethers

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
to enjoy

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Has it met your expectations?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Yes, it's quite good, it's very good

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Anything else you would like to add on the record while we're here?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Those are all my questions, and there were two questions from Roy which was about the project

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Anything else you would like to add or share

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
that you feel the future generations must know about?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Yes, I got my three children

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
and my daughters are married

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
they went to university and all that

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
and they are married and they got their own children now

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
and my son is still single

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
he did pharmacy first

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
then he decided to do medicine

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
and he is a junior doctor now

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
My children are very close to each other

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
that was my aim to brought them up very close

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
and they are close

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
they get together, have their good time, and I have good time with them

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
with my grandchildren, though my grandson is 19 now

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
and my one granddaughter is 16

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
and my two grandsons are 7 and 3

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
and we have good time together when they come over

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
and I will advise them to stay together

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
though they live in their own lives

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
but stick together and have a good time

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
that's the main values

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
respect each other

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
this is what I would expect from them

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Thank you very much for your time
