WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So I've just got to do something at the very beginning, that's okay. I've just got to say that my name is Marsha Mani and I'm here with Hugh Grant, not the Hugh Grant.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The better looking one.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Stop it John. Then John Southerl and John Southerl.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Southerl.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Southerl and Mrs Southerl. What's your Christian name?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Valerie.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Valerie and then it's, we're at, I can't say it, Koikouniou.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Koikouniou.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Koikouniou.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Yes, translated means Cornishman's Wood.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Really?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Yeah. Curnow is the Cornish way of saying Corn or Curnow. It's just like a corruption of Curnow, Curniou and Koid as well as for wood, as in, not a lump of wood, as in a clump of trees.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So it's this Cornishman's Wood.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Do we know why?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Yes, it goes back to King, was it? Back to early medieval times when he granted this land to the Duke or, I think it would be the Duke of Cornwall.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And hence it was called then Koid Curniou, Cornishman's Wood.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Ah.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I didn't know that.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You don't know everything, ma'am. I have independently found out certain things.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm not sure if it was, who was it, Edward Longshanks, it might have been, the Hammer of the Scots, it might have been him or his son.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
With the third or the fourth.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It was the third, wasn't it?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Yeah, Longshanks.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Longshanks, yeah. Yeah, so, the Hammer of the Scots. I think it might have been him or his son that granted this to the Earl of Cornwall or the Duke of Cornwall or whatever.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So it's April the 18th, 2019. I've just got to have those details down for archival purposes. So, do you mind me, Valerie, if I ask your date of birth?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Everybody asks me that. I don't know what date it is.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
29th of the 13th, I'm just 29th. It was the 90th last week.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Yeah.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
90?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
90, yeah, 29th.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
My God, you look good to 90, don't you?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I don't feel very good.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Oh, my goodness.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I don't know what better when there's leg-wadding in such a state.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That's right, yeah.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So, where were you born, Valerie?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
In Marshfield. Well, Castleton it was then.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Yeah.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The address was Castleton. Between McMarshfield and...

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
In Gathley Bay?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Yeah, in Gathley... No, yeah, Gathley Bay.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That's the farm?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Yeah.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
How do you spell that?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Well, we always spelled it G-double-L-Y-B-A-R.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But it was G-double-L-I?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
No, when I was living down there it was G-double-L-Y-B-E-A-R, Gathley Bay, is what it was called.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And what does that mean?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I don't know. But people after altered it and they put it to Gathley Gay.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So, people only know it really as Gathley Gay, not Gathley Bay.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Even, you know, when I was living down there.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's Gathley Bay.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Pardon?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It's Gathley Bay, though.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I don't know whether they call it Gathley Bay.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Yeah, it's Gathley Bay.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Oh, Gathley Bay, but it must be spelled different.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
G-double-L-I-B-E-R.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And it's still there?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Yeah, it's a...

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's not the farm as it was when I was there.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It's more like a mansion, though.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Yeah, it is.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So, but John, you were saying it was the old... it said to be the oldest house in Mummarsh here?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
That was always the thought, wasn't it?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
What's that?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
That Gathley Bay was the oldest house in Mummarsh.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Yeah, well, it was always said. I don't know how true that was.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And they used to say about this woman that it was drawn during the big floods, you know, in the...

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
It was supposed to be drawn in the window above the porch.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Yeah.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But rather it wasn't true, though, was it? It was found out there was...

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Like a lot of these old tales, they tell you to be...

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It got altered, you know. But it was true, wasn't it?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But she wasn't the ghost, though, was she?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I'd never seen a ghost on a house.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Do you know, they had a corridor going between the rooms up there there?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Yeah.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
There was three... no, two and a half, actually, planks like that of an oak tree cut in the...

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
That was the floorboards.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Just three?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Yeah.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Wow.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But they were... as they were cut from the tree, you know, just...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
shizzled off, like, you know, polished sort of thing.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
That's phenomenal.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And then he went down the steps then into a little room, and that room was where she's supposed to have drowned.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
That was the original story.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So who was she? Do we know who she was?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You knew the name, didn't you?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Yeah, I can't remember it.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I've heard the story, yeah, and I remember then...

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Oh...

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I read it not so long ago somewhere.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I'll get back to you in an hour, Marcia.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Okay.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I'll definitely get back to you in an hour.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I know I've got that written down somewhere.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
There is a history...

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So I remember thinking, oh, Christ, I must remember to tell that to Mam.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
There was a history of that in Marshfield Church, my darling, the records of...

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Oh, right.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
...of the plan, because it was built the same year.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
It was built the same year as the church?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Yeah.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So is it to Norman Church?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I don't know.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I know it was a monastery years ago.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
What, the church or the farmhouse?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
The farmhouse.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
A monastery?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
We're looking from the farmhouse, like looking down here, you'd be looking at the church.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Yeah.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
You know, to get the fields down.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Yeah.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Well, apparently the sea used to come...

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
There was no seawall then, look, and that was...

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The ships used to come up down here, and the pirates used to go in the church,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and they had a tunnel from the church up into the farmhouse, look.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And they used to have spirits and all, you know, do all that sort of thing.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And they were...

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The archaeologists did come there digging up after we left, like, you know.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
They wanted to know a lot about it, because they'd heard these stories,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and they did find the beginning of a path of a tunnel, but it was all...

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Really?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
All gone in, like, you know, sunk in.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So on the slope you could...

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And it would look...

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You'd look straight into the...

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Like, from the porch to the church porch, you was more or less looking straight in.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
They were identical.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Gosh!

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
It's almost a straight line.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Yeah.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
The walls were seven foot thick in that place, right?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Hmm.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
That's believable.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So how old do you think it is?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Well, it's...

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I don't know whether that was true.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
We're not very good with the centuries.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I thought it was built in the 11th century.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I don't know if that was right.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Wow.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But that would make it Norman.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Yeah, that sounds about right.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Yeah.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But it was...

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
When it was built then, it was only...

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
It was just like a small place, but it was built...

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
The front of it was the same, you know.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And in 1909, Lord Trudeegan had it altered, because the house itself was down in the ground,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
like, part of it, and they dug it all out, and they filled part of the house in,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the cellar that was to be there, with all the rubble and the stuff from the orchard,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
because my gran was...

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
She married my grandfather, I don't know what year it was.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
She was 18, he was 21, I think, and she used to have a few words with him.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
She'd go in...

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
It was before it was dug out now, and she'd climb out through the pantry window

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and run up back to her father in St. Melan's, to her father's house,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and then they dug it all out.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It was a big boat this width, I suppose, of paving in all round,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and then you had the orchard, it was set in a circle, like, you know.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So was it like a walled orchard?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
They never put a wall there, the orchard was left as a bank.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Gosh.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
But the host...

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Well, they do a pre-casted part of it then, you know,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
but the top part, I think, was left as it was.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
There were 13 rooms in then, after they'd done it all,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
but when the monks were there, it was only a small place,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
because we had a photograph of that from someone,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I can't even know what happened to that.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So do you know who the monks were?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I don't know.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
How curious.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And then they...

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I'll tell you, the old vicar from Marshfield,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that's where we used to get a lot of our knowledge of the farm,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
but he was very interested in all that sort of thing.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
What was his name?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Karen Stanley.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And he did a lot of...

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Wasn't it Stanley Stanley?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Pardon?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Wasn't it Stanley Stanley?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Well, we always called him Karen Stanley.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I'm sure you remember seeing him.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I think that's his son, he was a doctor.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And he was Stanley Stanley.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
He was Stanley, yes, Stanley Stanley.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
No, that was that place.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
That's right, Dr Stanley Stanley.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
That's right, I remember, I know Dr Stanley Stanley,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
not a reverend, yeah.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So did it belong to the Tredegas then?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Yeah, Tredegas, yeah, it always belonged to Tredegas.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So it was a tenanted farm?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Tenancy, yeah, there was no...

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Well, when I left there, there was no water, no electric,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
no... nothing like that down there.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So describe it to me, what did it look like,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and what rooms did you have?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Well, you look at the front of the church,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
it looked like that,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and it was a...

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
it was difficult to explain.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Because where they added, added on,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
another part of the house,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
donkeys years ago,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
the roof used to come down from that one and down from that one,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and you had a gully at the top,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and if it snowed, it used to get all full of snow up in there,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
up in that area.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
In the house?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
No, up on the roof, like, you know.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
But we never went up in the attic,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
it was all...

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Gondolier.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Gondolier, you know, you had to go up there,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
haunted.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Haunted?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Was it haunted?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I've never seen a ghost there.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
There was supposed to have been a ghost,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
but I'd never seen him, or whoever it was supposed to be.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
It was supposed to be the woman that drowned.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
What happened to all your photographs of Gatley Bay?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I just...

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Well, the pair I had in the back of the house,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I gave them away, look,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and the friend of the house,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I had them framed and I gave them to...

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
what?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
What do you call them?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Myrrhals?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
No, not Myrrhals, the other one.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Haels?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
When they moved there, look.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I was looking for them, and I thought that I remembered after.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
They were coloured photographs.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
It was taken when the house was sold.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
You know, for the agents.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
You haven't got any of you

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
of the child living there,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
or anything like that?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I got some somewhere.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I think I got one there,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and they showed you the porch.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I think it's...

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
my mother stood there.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I should have had time to look at that.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Look for that.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Don't worry, do you?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Have you ever been up there, John?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Gatley Bay?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Yeah, loads of times.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
We got a rena-rense on the bottom of that.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It was very good.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
That's where my family's from, there.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Do you know the...

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Do you know the Betty and the Fam?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
The Frump Fam, do you remember that?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Well, that's where all our...

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
my great-grandfather

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
was born, and all...

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
They had 13 children all together,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
sons and daughters.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Your great-grandfather?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Yeah.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Was that Henry Steele?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
No, I forget his name.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
So your family

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
has been here for generations,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
haven't they, Barry?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
That's the old man from the family.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
That's the old man from Betty.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
He had fathered all the children.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
That's your great-grandfather?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
That's my great-grandfather.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And he was a clergyman?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Well, everybody says that, but I never, ever...

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
He's got the top.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Apparently, yeah, but nobody ever...

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
There's no record of him ever being a clergyman,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
whether he's a false clergyman or whatever.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I know, but...

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I came from...

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
She was a sister

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
to my grandfather.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
He was the father

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
of the family, like, you know, the old ones.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Well, he looks very

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
upstanding, doesn't he?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
When he died,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
you know the

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
place up here on the top road?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Oh, of course it's not there, no.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
It used to be called the Tavern.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
They used to have a big peacock...

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
What do you call that?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Topiary.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Everybody knew that was where the place was,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
like, you know.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
The edge was like a peacock.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
There was a place down at Church House

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
called Parsons's Patch.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And that's where all the family

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
are buried down there, look.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And he was being buried.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
No, he died.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And it was all horses then, of course.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
It collapsed with his weight

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
on the hill coming down to go down to the

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
church.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
What the carts did?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
The hearse that he was in.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
He was such a big man.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And we've retained the genes.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So, were you

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
born up there then, Valerie,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
in that farmhouse?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
No, no, I was born in... born during

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
the day in Castleton.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So when did you move to the farm?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Well, I was born in the farm.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
You were born in the farm?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
But he lived there, didn't you?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
That guy, Henry...

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
was that Henry Steele, ma'am?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Henry Steele.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Parsons, was it?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
He was from

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Berry Hill, which is just over by there.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Literally just over by there.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And mam was born in

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Gatley Bay, which is a little bit further

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that way. There's a load of little farms around here.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Would they have been...

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Parsons is in, as well as

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Berry Hill?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Grimmer's old place.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
They were all Parsons's in Berry Hill.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Was Grimmer's old farm what Grimmer used to be?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Grimmer, yeah. That's Berry Hill.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
What's the next one then?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I don't know.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You've got Berry Hill?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Yeah.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Isn't another farm...

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Oh, no, it's over Tyn and Ant now.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
We've got to move as far as Tyn and Ant, haven't we?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Tyn and Ant Cottages.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So, who were your parents

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
then, Valerie? What were their names?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
My mother was from Cardiff.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
She was a Miss Fox.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And my father was a Parsons,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
look, because he was... That's his father there.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
His grandfather.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Oh, no, I'm getting muddled up.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
That's his grandfather there, my great-grandfather.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Yeah.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So, your father

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
was a Parson? Yeah.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Was he a farmer as well? Yeah, there was...

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
So, when you're a

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Parson, does that mean you have a church?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
No, it's the family name Parsons.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Oh, I see.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
A Parson is a...

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Sorry, I thought a churchman.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
No, no.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
It's like, what the hell's going on here?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
His name was Parsons.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
But he wasn't a Parson.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
I got a small photograph somewhere

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
of my mother and I

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
stood by the...

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
How did your mother meet your father then?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Oh, there's a story too.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
It was during the First World War.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And the food was short.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
The food was... The farmer always had potatoes

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and things like that.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And they'd grown their own food.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I found that photograph of Nan.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Pardon? That photograph of Nan.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
You know, the one they got in that

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
silvery thing with the clock on it.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I don't know.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
God, I got that somewhere.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I got a photograph of my mother.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
She stood

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
in the front bit, in the porch.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
But talking about

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
the name of the...

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I'll have to look it up.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Give it to Johnny.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So your mother met your father in the First World War?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
She was a young woman then.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
She had a friend.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
She lived in Cardiff in Marion Street.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And they used to come out.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
My grandmother was a friend

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
of this lady that lived

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
in the farm at the time.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And... Oh, my grandmother.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
That's right, of course. What am I on about?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
She came out to see my grandmother.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
they went out the back.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And all the peelings of the

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
potatoes was out there.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And my mother couldn't get over that

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
because they had no potatoes in town.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
So she took a bag of these

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
potatoes home and scrubbed them.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
The potatoes, the skins.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Yeah, the peelings.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Cooked them. So my

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
grandmother said to her, would you like some

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
cheese for your dinner?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So they agreed on cheese.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Well, when my mother seen the plate of cheese

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
she thought it was for all of them.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Which for her...

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
She used to make her own cheese and I'd look.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And of course they had nothing like that

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
during the First World War.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
They were down and out, starving practically.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
You know, you couldn't get food.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I know, I scanned it

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
and I got it on my computer in work.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
I got a photograph of

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
now I'm standing right by that

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
porch and I can't find it.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
I know that photograph of Nan

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
with her brother and sister

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and mum and dad.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Well, that's the one

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
he was looking for. There's two he was looking for.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
They can't find him now.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So then is that how she met your

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
father then?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Well, he was one of the sons there, look. So that's where she came to meet him.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
There was

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
four sons.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Yeah, she had four sons.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
She had two daughters and four

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
sons. My father

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
was the oldest and then she had a

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
little girl. Well, in

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
them days they used to

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
make their own beer and everything down there

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
because they had cider presses and

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
even I remember the cider presses down there

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
and everything. Do you? Yeah.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
They were there when they left.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
My Nan used to play the piano

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
for the silent movies in the theatres.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
She used to get a half a

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
crown. Where?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
In Canada, wasn't her? Yeah.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Before

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
talking she'd be the one doing the things.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
She used to get a half a crown for doing all of the Saturdays.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
What was her name?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
May. May Fox.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
May Fox? Yeah.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
What a great name.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Well, she was very musical.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
She used to sing.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
She had certificates for singing and

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
studying your steadfast and all that sort of thing.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
played the piano and all.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
And when she went for her exams

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
she was a Miss Fox.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
When we taught her

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
it was a Mr Bull

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
and when they examined her

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
the thing was Mr Lions.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
They got that

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
certificate somewhere.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
My brother's inherited her genes.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Really? From music. Yeah.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
My brother's very great music.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
He plays lots of instruments. Really?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
What about you John?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I used to just crash about on the drums

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
having fun, you know.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Oh, look at that. That's how it used to be

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
don't you look?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Is that a dry window, ma'am?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
That's my bedroom window, is it?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
That's before they planted all the trees out.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
That's before LG came in.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Wow.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Do you remember the size of the beds working?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
That's the sea wall, ma'am.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
That is, oh.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
I thought that was the one that...

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
I was going to say that.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
That looks very barren.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
I got one of the others

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
somewhere.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I should have looked through these before.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I never thought.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
What's this one?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
This looks a bit

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
ancient.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Come up.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Oh, it's in here.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Do you remember

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
the cider press?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Do you remember them making cider there?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
No. No.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
I don't remember.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
The cheese press was there as well.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
The cheese press was in

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
the room used to call the dairy.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
It was always called the dairy because it had a big

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
slate stone

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
right around

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
like that.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
The cheese press would go the length of the wall.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Really?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
It had two big boxes on it like that.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
A lid on it and they had big stones in there.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
And then

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
either end they had two

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
things you could roll.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Like an old-fashioned

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
mango.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
But one

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
roller like that.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
They put the cheeses underneath

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
in this box.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Then they put the cheeses, the vats

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
with the cheese in it.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
They'd wind this thing up and they'd bring it down

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
and press it until

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
they pressed all the cheese in.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Then above that they used to have a room they called the cheese room

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
where they used to put them up to dry.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Really?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
That stone steps to go up to that.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Was that before your time?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Oh yeah, my gran used to do that.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
But I don't remember it.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I remember making it once with a bit of cheese

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
down there but not with the presses.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
All the vats used to be all around the

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
vats are the things they put the cheese in.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
The wooden things.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
She used to get first prize in

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Caerphilly for the cheese.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Did she have

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
a name for it?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Caerphilly cheese.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Wow, that's amazing.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Do you remember the taste?

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Yeah, I can remember

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
the cheese, yeah.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I don't know if those

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
were pictures, no.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
So did you have to work

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
on the farm? I worked on the farm all my life.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
What did you have to do?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Everything.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
I was milking when I was nine.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
I was milking cows.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Really?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And it was all hand milk then?

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Yeah.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Was that full of the cheese?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
No, that went down the dairies.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Down the mashfield dairies.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Oh, it went to mashfield dairies.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
And my father

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
he was the

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
the one son

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
was in the army.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
The other son, he couldn't go

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
to the army because he had

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
something wrong with his

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
asthma and something. So he failed his

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
test. My father had to stay

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
home.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
The other one went to the

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
where did he go?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
The younger one went to the

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
university so he was out of it.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
He never done anything with the war.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
But my father,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
he stayed home

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
because

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
all those sons and daughters

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
over there that

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
lived there

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
that was including my grandfather

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
were drunkards.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
They were all

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
and of course

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
the father, my grandfather

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
was tenant to

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Tredegar

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
all the farms was owned by

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Tredegar. Oh, were they?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
And so was all the game?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Everything. You didn't touch anything

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
on the farm because my father

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
was a good shot with a gun.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
You didn't dream of shooting

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
a pheasant, did you?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Or fishing.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
There was no fishing around there.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
I know they used to sneak

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
a couple occasionally.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
They used to be

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
a little break as they used to call it

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
like a little wood just

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
past the house. And in the

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
moonlight night you'd see the pheasants

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
perched in the trees.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
And

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
the one brother who would keep a lookout

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
at the old Holloway, Holloway's name was

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
The gamekeeper, was he?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
The gamekeeper. Yeah.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
He wasn't around because he was sneaky

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
you know.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And then my father would be there

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
shooting a pheasant

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
you know. But they wouldn't touch it.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
They'd shoot it. They'd see it drop out

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
the tree leg and then they'd go

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
and wait until the next morning before they

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
go and pick it up. Terrified they'd get

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
checked out. Look if they got caught.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Yeah.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Then what are they going to do with the feathers?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
They were afraid to leave a feather on

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
anywhere around like you know. Gosh.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
So they used to have to burn them then.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And as

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
they plucked them so they burned. I can remember

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
that. Yeah. When they used to sneak

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
the pheasants. Really?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Yes because I always wanted one

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
of them pretty long tails out of the

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
photo. Yeah. I couldn't have one of them.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
They had it. No, no, you

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
mustn't have that like you know. Gosh.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
They were still afraid of it.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And if you found a pheasant's nest

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
when you were you know when

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
as kids he was always rolling around

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
and you'd go and tell Holloway

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
you'd get half a crown for the clutch of that

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
egg so those eggs looked at showing where they

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
were. Really? So they'd go and hatch them out then over

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
to over there. Over to

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Tegur.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
So Derek and I asked

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
my brother like you know we used to always go around

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
looking for pheasant's nests.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
And if there was only a couple of eggs who

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
touched them don't go over there, don't go over there

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
until she finished laying them all look

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
and then go and tell Holloway

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
then. Because they used to have

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
big pheasant shoots then on those eggs. Yeah, yeah.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
They'd breed them then look.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Ah. But er

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
there was hard times then.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
So did you say

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
you didn't have water or electricity?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
No, no. They had a pump

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
for water. Outside?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Yeah. Well everything was

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
outside. Is that from a borehole though?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Is that from a borehole?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
In the ground? Is it a well?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Yeah, fresh spring water. There must have been a spring

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
there like you know just in front of the house.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
But I'll have a look for

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
some of their old photographs and

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
I'll give them to John.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
I know he's got some somewhere but I don't know where they are

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
at the moment. We'll come back with a transcription

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
anyway so we can have a look

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
at them then. What about toilets then?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Was there toilets outside?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
You had to go

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
half a mile up the garden for that.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
And there was a toilet

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
it was all

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
as long as a settee perhaps.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
And you had a big hole that end

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
and a small hole that end.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Anything in between? Nothing.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Oh. All eyes to the front.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
No, it was a

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
shed

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
like a building built

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
like you know in this toilet built in there.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
And then

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
it had like a cesspit at the back of it.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
And every so often you had to take a

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
bag of white lime or something

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
that had to be thrown in there.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
But there was nothing at all.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
There was a big seat for the

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
grown ups and a little seat hole for

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
the kids.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
And a chamber pot under the bed?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Well they were there when I was in the house.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
That went on the rhubarb.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
So that's why you know the hours after.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Don't you wonder why the people

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
in the valleys got good rhubarb?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
No. They used to throw their wheelies in there.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
They used to have their toilet pans

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
on the rhubarb. I've never

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
heard that.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Never eating rhubarb again. My god.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Did you have, was that one of your jobs?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Did you have to do that?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Was that one of your jobs? No, we would have if we

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
had rhubarb.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Well there was no sanities

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
no collection of sanities

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
or anything like that.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Or ash

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
nothing like that. So where did

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
your heating come from? Did you have a range?

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
That range is still in the farmhouse.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Is it?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
They haven't ripped it out?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
I think they got it as a wine thing.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
It would be worth a fortune

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
then wouldn't it? They'd love that sort of thing.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Those oak

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
panels

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
on the floor. These days

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
the architectural salvage

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
they'd be charging thousands for that sort of thing.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
They must have been a whole

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
plank out of a tree

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
cut down three, like

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
two.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
The width of the tree and one and a half

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
So were there any secret rooms in the house

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
or anything like that?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Well only the one

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
secret they used to call it the

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
kutch.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
And that's where they reckoned the

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
ponds used to come up look.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
They'd come from the church down in the

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
under the, what do you call it, the best tree

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
I think it is down there.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
There's a place they reckoned they'd come from there.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And up under this tunnel

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
that used to come up in the farm. They invested

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
all about it but they couldn't get

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
because they were asking me about that

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
you know. Oh pirates you mean?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Yeah. Oh wow.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Smugglers, smugglers whatever they are.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
They'd bring their boats up the channel

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
and because there was

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
nothing there then

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Peterstone was the biggest port

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
in South Wales then wasn't it?

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
So the sea would have been much closer then?

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
They'd be down here at St Bryce

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Peterstone you know. Why really?

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Because there was a dock

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
it was quite a lot of tunnel mine

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
but

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
the biggest port in South Wales until

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
probably about 1400

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
some of that. And the old cannon

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
standing, ER was reckoned

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
the monks.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
We don't know if there's a field down

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
in fact down in the moors by the

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
railway lane which was rented

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
by the family like you know

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
over the house down there land.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
And it was always called the church yard

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
never thought

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
anything about it like we know

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
so it was over in the church yard

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
over the middle of the field

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
and the old cannon standing

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
investigated and he reckoned

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
it was the monks with their burial

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
grounds. The monks?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
The monks from the farm

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
with their burial ground in that

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
piece of ground yeah.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
So

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
I don't know.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
You know we got no proof

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
of it like you know.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
There was nothing in the house to

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
suggest that. We didn't find

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
anything in the garden. I know we had

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
a big door to go in

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
the front door but

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
you had this big porch in the front

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
you know and then inside you had

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
another

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
big door, an oak door

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
that was. Gosh it was

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
a huge thing we never used to shut

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
it down. It was heavy to shut.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
A big door. That was left

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
on the farm.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
One little piece of our bank left.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
I wonder if I should knock on the door

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
and have a look. I've already taken a city down a

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
bit. What's the show about? I'd love to

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
see that John. What's that? What you're just talking

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
about? The um

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
pizza and war.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Somebody else was talking about that the other day.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Was it, what's the name with

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
doing the history?

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
My grandfather would never pack a

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
card in here was the look. Why not?

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Because there's a farm

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
where it's not the farm. There was a golf course

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
down near the Mardy they called it.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
His brother was down there, Henry Parsons.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
And every

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Sunday night they used to have a

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
card session down there

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
with a gambling going on you know.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Drinking gambling.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
But something happened one night.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
I inherited the gambling genes.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
One night apparently

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
they swore the devil come down

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
the chimney. The one

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
went out and hung himself on the gate. One of these

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
folks that was there, they didn't know who he was.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
But he hung himself.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
My father, my grandfather, he was

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
petrified. He'd never have a

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
he wouldn't have a pack of cards anywhere in the house.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Leave alone play. You didn't

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
get a pack of cards. Oh my

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
goodness. They were petrified.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
I know they used to, they were

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
a lot of drinkers but

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Doesn't mean good cider. Yeah.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
His one sister

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
I don't know what would she be to me.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
He was my great grandfather.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Anyway, it's one of his sisters.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Her husband

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
kept the Royal Oak in Cardiff.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
He owned that.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
And she used to get drink

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
all the time.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
He used to pay privately

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
for a woman to look after her

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
to make sure she didn't get the drink

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
from the bar or whatever.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
But she was still getting the drink

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
all the time. So

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
still getting drink.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
They decided then they were going to move.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
So they moved.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
And when they started to move

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
suddenly was rattling in the

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
furniture. She had all the back

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
cut open like you know.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And stitched and she had it all packed in

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
between the springs or the backs

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
of the furniture. And she was

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
having a nip now and again.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Filled with bottles of spirits.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Well she had somebody in tow

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
with her I think. Getting it

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
pulled. And she had it

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
stuffed in there. Well I can remember

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
her because she came at the farm to live.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Why did she come to live with you?

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Because that

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
family is all mixed up.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Brothers married

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
wives and

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
sisters

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
cousins. Married first cousins.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Oh my goodness.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Anyway

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
the one woman

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
my aunt that was living

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
with us.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Her father, her husband

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
was

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
my father's brother

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
look. And

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
he was the one that was in the war.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Well they got married

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
and she went on both calls

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
to live. Of course her mother went with her.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Little woman she was

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
with

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
white thick hair she had.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
And only little. And

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
she'd come up now

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
my aunt now up to see

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
his brother now. The farm.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
She'd leave her mother down there

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
look with her husband.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
And then she'd get a message

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
somebody'd send a message up that

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
she was drunk again.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
They couldn't find out where she was

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
getting it from.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
They tried always. Still getting

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
it. So anyway she got drunk

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
this one day and my aunt went

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
down to see what her mother

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
had been up to like you know.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
And they had to carry it up to bed and her head went on

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
one side and she used to have a big bun at the back

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
of her head. And she had a little bottle in there

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
full of

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
brandy.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
It's quite ingenious

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
really isn't it. Well she'd do look she'd stop

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
people on the doorstep and ask them

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
to give them a few pound look to go and

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
get a bottle of whiskey.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
They were all

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
heavy drinkers.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
My father

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
what a family. All the sons

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
the four sons. The people who were pride on.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Because their father

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
drunk all the money on the farm

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
and he went bankrupt.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
When he

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
died then they took

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
well before he died

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
they took over.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
They went to dig

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
his brother the brother that was in the farm

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
his family

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Berry Hill paid

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
the rent to keep his brother there

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
look. Really. He didn't let them know

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
that he'd gone bankrupt but it was silently

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
he was paying the rent.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
My father found out

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
look. So

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
he was an

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
engineer in Newport

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
in the docks. He'd give up his job

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
and the other one was home

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
normally. And the two

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
of them together

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
got enough money to pay back

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
what they paid the

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
other brother to be tenants

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
again. So the larger diggers

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
didn't even know that that

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
had happened sort of thing. Really.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
So anyway

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
that's how

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
they came to be.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
As I said they were all drunkards.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
And the women

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
seemed to marry

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
drunkards like you know

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
farmers and because they used to make

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
their own most of them. Yeah. So were there

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
lots of orchards around here then?

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
They all had orchards.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
A big orchard down the farm. They had a cider

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
apple trees down there

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
and walnut trees. All of it.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
And it would have all been used

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
not gone to waste?

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
A lot of it went to waste because

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
my father and his brother

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
they never done anything like that.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Things changed you know

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
in the war camp. First of all

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
war and all that. So as a child

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
and you're standing at the front of your

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
home and you're looking out

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
what could you see?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
What did it look like?

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Just down the moors. Yeah? Yeah.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
So has it changed much then?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Not that much. Well I don't know

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
I haven't been over that end but I mean this

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
have all changed. You can see this was all flat.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Now where you would have seen ma'am

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
it's all like

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
sculpted

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
gardens and ponds and everything now.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
You've got

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
the sweep down to the church

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
you know. You'd look out and you'd see

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
down towards the church

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
that big sweep of land there. It's got like

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
ornamental lakes and stuff on it.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
It's all totally different.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Nothing like it.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
That would have been all like

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
traditional

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
levels farmland. Yeah.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
It was just ordinary farmland.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Like all the fields

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
had names like you know

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
you knew your fields by names.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Did you? Oh yeah. Do you remember any of the

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
names? Yeah no more.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
They could take you there to see them if they were still there.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
What sort of names were they?

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
There was Spade

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Spurgeon didn't you? Yeah.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
His field was. Well I told you about

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Spurgeon. Yeah.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
The travelling preacher.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
That's just off. Not off. That's off

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Castleton that is. Well you can Google him

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
you'll find out about him. The reverend

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
was he a reverend?

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Spurgeon. Spurgeon.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
The travelling preacher used to go around

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Britain. It's a field

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
like you walk into

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
you think it would

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
but it slumps right down like that and

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
he used to have all his parishioners or whatever they were

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
or down he'd be up on

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
the top preaching. Really?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Yeah. What sort of period

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
was this? Victorian

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
I've been late Victorian over the manor. Not in old

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
time. Come online and you'll find a lot of stuff about

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
the reverend Spurgeon and he said he used to come

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
to Wales he used to come to mam's farm

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
to do his preaching and he used to come from all

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
around to listen to it. Well he's known as Spurgeon

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Spurgeon. Spurgeon Spurgeon.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Isn't that amazing? Yeah.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Any other names?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
All these Spurgeons feel for that one.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
We had all names like

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
the field behind the orchard

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
and the rushy field which had

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
the moors like and it was all rushes. You had the field

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
in front of the house. You had the

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
rickyard as we used to call it.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
It was Rickyard it was. We used to say

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Rickyyard. There was a field

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
behind that because they had all the moes

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
and all in the

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
yard part. You had all the moes?

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
They wouldn't know these things.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
These are ancient farming

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
techniques. These days you have all your hay

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
is put into bales

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
and back then

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
it was all they were putting in what was called

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
maws which is about a pile

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
of hay really.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Like a dome.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Yeah. A rick in other

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
words. That's what they said the rickyard

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
but the moes we used to have in there.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
How do you spell moe? Moes.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
M-O-W? Yeah.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Never heard that before. Yeah.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
I used to

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
have to load the

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
trolleys up you know with the hay.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
You'd have the workers by the side

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
you with the pikes of hay shutting them

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
up to you and then you used to make them

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
out with the corners first. Fill in the

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
middle you know and do that.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
And you'd have prisoners of war to win.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Yeah and then the war came and

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
we'd have

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
corn then. You'd have

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
to have corn and wheat and everything

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
because you had to cut up

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
half your fields. If you had

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
cows and sheep together,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
like we did, you had to get

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
rid of either the cows or the sheep

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
because you had to cut up, you know

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
plough up the land, plant.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
To plant corn and wheat. Yeah.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
So it was

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
you make the stucks as we used to call them.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
You

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
have the sheaths of corn like you know

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
the bundles and you'd get two and you'd get

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
one of your own and you'd go like that and you'd

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
stand them on the, you'd put three in a row

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
like and you'd have all these rows of

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
stucks to dry the corn.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
It looks gorgeous.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
And then you'd get these awesome

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
trolleys then. It was tractors

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
and things. And you'd get the

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
awesome cad and I'd have to be on

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
the top then

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
loading.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Because I heard that when they were doing that, you know

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
going round cutting it, then you

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
would get the rabbits and the rats.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Oh yeah, rats

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
and everything. When it came time for

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
thrashing, you'd have the mows now

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
of corn.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
You build them with all the

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
roots, the stalks on the

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
outside and you'd fill them in with

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
all the

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
heads was all in the centre to keep them

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
dry. Look, you build it

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
with all the stalks on the outside.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
And then they'd come around with a

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
thrashing machine and a gang

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
to thrash. And

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
I used to have to be on doing them.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
But you'd get up on the mow now

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
throwing them into the, cutting the corn

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
throwing them into the binder.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
The rats would be coming out

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
and they'd just get sixpence of tail

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
during the war.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
They'd have even tails on the floor.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Rats' tails. Who was collecting

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
the tails? There was some

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
scheme going on with, you know

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
at Britain or whatever it was like,

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
you know, waiting for victory

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
and that sort of thing. Did you

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
put rope, string around your

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
trouser hem so the rats

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
didn't run up? I'd rather go on

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
the loading pad where the

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
sacks went, corn went into

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
the sacks. The men used to do

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
most of the loading, you know.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
They'd throw it in the

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
thrasher. So was it a mobile

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
thrasher? It came from farm to farm?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Yes, but it had a belt, it had a tractor

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
with a big belt going around it

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
driving it like, you know.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
It had two sacks at the back of it

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
hooked on like, you know, and you'd

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
fill it, come out through the

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
chutes, like, you know. It was very dusty,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
wasn't it? Very dusty work?

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
You had chaff come out of it,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
like, you know.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
You'd put that, chuck that away then.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
So you had some POWs

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
coming? Yeah. Where did they come

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
from? Italy, some were

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
based.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Well, I guess which country were from and where was the POW come from?

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Italy, the first lot we had.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Yeah. And then the Germans.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
But

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
they had a camp up in Castleton, look.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Really? I didn't know that.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Just by the coaching horses. You know, they

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
got a nursing home there now, I think.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Yes. There used to be a

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
prisoner of war camp there.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Do you remember any of their names?

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Well, you can remember a couple of them, but

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
I don't know what their surnames were.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
But then Evan was one, I think

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
he was a butcher, I think, as far as I remember.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
And I was one of them.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
I seen him off.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
It was nice to be known.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Fifteen then,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
I was 14 or 15, I expect.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
And he said this bloke down here, he couldn't speak

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
English.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
And I had a job now, my uncle

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
had tell me what to tell him

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
to do, you know. Well, I was

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
to care the estate.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Anyway, I had to get this horse out.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
He was the sad train that tell us about all of his

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
the mafia in

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Sicily that he was

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
being chased by the mafia and he had this white

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
horse and I don't know what it was altogether.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
And

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
anyway, we had him down there.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
He was

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
quite old, mate,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
because he was bald, he had hair on the top.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Quite old.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Anyway,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
I tried to show him how to harness

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
the horse, you know, he wanted a bit of help.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Because you've got a band about as wide as that.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
A leather band,

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
long band, it would go right round the horse's

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
stomach, you know. And on each

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
side of it you had a hook

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
and you'd have a lot of chains hanging on

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
there, like when you put on

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
it to tow things and all.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And I tried to get him

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
to do this and I couldn't really understand

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
and I grabbed it off

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
him, like, and he was one side of the horse and

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
there was the other. And I threw

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
it like that over the horse and it landed on the

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
top of his head and he knocked him out.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Kept the top of his head open.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
So he had to go up

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
to the hospital over there and have a stitch

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
put in it. So when he came

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
back, no, we had

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
to shift some manure

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
from the shed, from the yard,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
from the cowshed. And I had

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
to take it up in the field and dump it

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
into piles so as you

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
go and spread it after, there was no

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
spreading in them days, you do it by

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
hand, you know. And

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
ugh,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
it's one of these tip carts, I don't

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
know if you know what I mean, it's

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
a one horse cart

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
and it goes

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
shafts, like, and then you've got a thing on

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
the back that you press the thing, push it

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
and it goes up and it will tip it all

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
out. Right. I took the

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
horse, I drove it up,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
like, took the horse up there with him

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
and showed him what to do

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
to tip it up. So he

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
tipped it up, you know. I was

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
on the back getting it all out

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
and I said to him, just put it down

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
like, it came down, I wanted him to put it down

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
because you had to put your foot up and pull

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
it, like, you know. I couldn't

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
get him to understand what I was trying to

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
I think he was just playing

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
stupidly, you know. So anyway

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
he had his, I didn't notice where his

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
hand was, and I put my

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
it's like this, I pulled it like that

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
and of course he had his thumb in the way

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
it just got up

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
and went down on his thumb so

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
he went back to us the last we've seen of him

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
anyway. He'd have been

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
killed if he'd stayed that much longer

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
like that. He went back to the friend he felt

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
he was safer than being with a man. Oh

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
how stupid. Oh my

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
goodness. Yeah,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
they were

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
they were more gullible, the Italians

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
if you can understand. They were

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
the Germans, the Germans

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
was a German, do you know what I mean? Yeah.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
And we had that one that came down

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
I'm sure he was from the SS.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Why? Oh. He was

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
a real

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
you only had to look at him to see he was a German

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
he had a square face, do you know what I mean?

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Blonde, tall fellow

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
getting on in yours

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
and he used to come in

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
where my aunt was there in the morning

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
cooking the breakfast like you know

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
and he'd come in and he'd have these

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
boots and he'd sort of

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
come in and he'd click his

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
heels together like that and he'd say good morning

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Mrs Parsons and how are you today?

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
You look very nice in that dress he used to say

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
I didn't like him and he was

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
horrible

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
he was a real, the way he used to click his

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
heels, do you know what I mean? Yeah.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
He was a real

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Nazi he was, I'm sure he was

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
he used to play the piano

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
In the house?

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Well he did have a go on the piano

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
my aunt's home yeah. But another

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
one we had which was a butcher little

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
fellow, if you feel sorry for him

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
he was a tailor

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
in his own country and

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
anyway

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
we had a barrage balloon come down in the

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
field

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
and it was made of silk, wasn't it?

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And all the top was

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
in like white, like a white

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
silk, so nice stuff it

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
was. So my brother goes out now

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
and he drags this blinking barrage

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
balloon, not a barrage balloon

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
parachute. They used to drop mines

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
with parachutes look and the old

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
parachute used to be silk

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
and he brought it down now

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
and we had it in the house for ages

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
and when this German

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
came there he said he was a tailor

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
my mother was showing him this thing

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
he said

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
I'll make something, oh and my brother

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
he used to work on a docks because it was

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
special work or something

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
and they found

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
two big rolls of material

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
now

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
what do you call it? Surge I think

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Grey Surge it was

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
and

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
two full sized, somebody had cut him and

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
they were going to pinch him and take him home

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
but my brother and his mate was a bit quicker

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
than them like you know

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
one was a fur like a donkey

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
brown fur type of thing

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
and another roll of surge

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
and he said to my mother

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
I'll make you a suit

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
in his own way like they got him to understand

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
so he got permission from the

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
camp now, could he come after

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
in the evenings like for so many

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
hours so they'd bring him

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
down and then they'd come back and fetch him back

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
like you know. Do you know he made

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
my mother

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
one jacket I think it was and two skirts

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
out of it and she wore them

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
for years

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
marvellous stuff it was

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
he said to my aunt I'll make you

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
a coat out of this

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
teddy bear type of

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
furry stuff like you know

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
so he made her a coat

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
and he made

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
me a blouse you know out of this

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
parachute, this silk blouse

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
yeah and I wore that to

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
death because you couldn't get clothes

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
during the war

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
that's such a lovely story

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
but that suit it was

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
she had it for years. You haven't got any

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
photographs of your mother wearing this stuff

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
I got, not with the suit no

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
but I got one of her standing in the porch and I must

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
find it because I know I got it

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
so you must have been delighted with the clothes

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
yeah

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
like a shirt it was like a v-neck

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
he was marvellous tailing me

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
because I used to stand and watch him

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
did he have a sewing machine?

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
we had a hand, old hand

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
sewing machine look

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
he was used to machines

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
in Germany

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
where to see him start off his feet had been going

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
instead of his hands anyway

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
he done it

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
button loaded and all that

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
oh my goodness

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
and the other was a butcher

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
another one we had was a butcher

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Evan I think his name was

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
he was petrified

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
to go back

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
because

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
the wall was there

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
and his sister

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
I think his two sisters

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
was living in this side of the wall

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
he was living in Leipzig

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
which was the other side, the Russian side

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
he wanted to go back to

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
where his sisters was

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
whether he ever did I don't know

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000
I don't think they would allow it

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
he had to go back to his own place

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
did you ever hear from them when they went back?

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
his brothers he didn't know

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
whether they were alive or dead

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000
because they were captured

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
and he was afraid to go back

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
goodness

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
so this one Christmas now he said he'd do

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
the Christmas dinner

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
it was goose we were having

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
and he

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
came over now

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
my mother was looking and he was doing something

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
with these potatoes

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
he was grating them

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
and he made these potato balls

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
and he made cannon balls

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
he was all grated up and he squeezed all the water out of them

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
oh he was like

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
dough

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
he was horrible

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
it was one of their German meals

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
like you know

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
I'll try that

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
how sweet though

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
did he eat with you?

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
so you treated them like

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
anyone else really?

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
if you could understand them

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
did any of them stay here after the war?

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
I don't know

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
they never knew what happened to them

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
they just disappeared

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
because they were sent back

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
one day gone the next

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
a lot of Poles here though aren't they?

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
they came after though

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
they were after the war were they?

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
they had supposed to raugers place in Castleton

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
they went to

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
the castle

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
they took over that

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
what was that a camp?

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
the German

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
after the war I think it was

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
a lot of them stayed

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
because a lot of my friends they all married

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
these Poles

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
a lot of Poles

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
lots of them partially weren't they?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Pyrrhic, Pelicas

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Machlos

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
we've got the Machlos, the Pelicas

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
so they all came to

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
went to the castle

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
I think it was

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
right on the end of the war

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
I think a lot came over in

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
46, 47, 48

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
yes it was

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
I tell you one field you forgot to mention

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
as well

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
graveyard field

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
I did I was telling you

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
I see

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
the Monks graveyard

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
I often wonder whether that was true

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
and the big

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
the field it went like it's all flat as you know

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
in the moors

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
it makes sense man because it's right next to an ancient public footpath

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
and there's this big mound

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
big like a field

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
big

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Vickastan used to study that

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
the homes

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
the homes yeah

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
but why would it be called a home I was thinking

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
was this right?

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
the Monks graveyard there was a

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
no not there

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000
but there was in a field

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
before you get to the farm

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
the Monks field you know

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
it's not one of our fields

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
it belonged to the next farm

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
because you had

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
have you still got those ditches all going in there

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
those fields

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
which ones left the homes where the homes are

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
yeah and we've got

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
ditches opposite well quite

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
close to the graveyard field

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
all these places you talk about

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
literally a mile from here you're just talking

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
just down the road you can see all

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
of it you can see the homes you can see Gathly Bay

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
graveyard field you can see

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
it all just down through here and then you're

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
wasn't survey maps John

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
with those names the graveyard field

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
the only person who knew about that was Al Viggo

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
yeah Matt Canastani

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
so he only told my mam

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
so my mam is the only person who ever knew that

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
he always used to come up the farm look and

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
have a talk and there's a couple of

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
pictures he was always after

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
of my grandmothers but she'd never let

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
him have them look what were the pictures

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
they were the

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
was that man who got his hand in

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Napoleon yeah

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
to fight the pictures of the war

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
like with the horses and

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
battle going on you know the guns shooting

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
and all yeah there was a pair of them

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
why did your mother have those

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
my grandmother it was why did she have a pair of

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
those pictures

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
I don't know where she got them from but

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
I think they were in the farm

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
when she came there

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
because she came there

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
when my grandfather finished

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
he went to

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
university nearly all his sons went to

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
university from

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Betty Illock

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
from in farms then

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
so Betty

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Gethi Becham

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000
vacant evidently

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
and when he finished university

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
she was about 21 I think he was 22

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
he married my grandmothers

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
she used to say

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
at her wedding

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
they used to have they shot the guns or

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
something over the wall at the end of the

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
front of the house

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
celebrations or something

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
he turned out a rotter

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
why did you call him mad

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
cannon Stanley

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000
well he was a bit odd

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
I used to be frightened to death of him as a kid

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
why

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
well it looks like he used to have this

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
everything he had on was black and it was

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
long black like you know

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
coat and everything and his black

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
hat he had on

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
he had two little black dogs he used

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
to have with him these little things

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
and they used to take them

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
oh he used to take them in the vicarage

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
it was weird it was dark

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
and he went

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
little like

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
porches to go down these steps

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
into his doctors surgery

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
ah but it was the

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
vicarage then

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
the one just past the masons

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
no there was no one around there

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
that's the way the vicarage is now isn't it

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
no you know as you're

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
going in the church lane as you come off

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
the main road around

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
oh of course Woody's old house

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
yes of course yes

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
yes it is

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
it's all done out now isn't it

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
it's a bit of a home now

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
it was a smell

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
in there like you know what I mean

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
an odd smell a foasty sauce

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000
his wife used to be all

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
in black

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000
she had a maid and she was all in black

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
and we used to have to go there for

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
confirmation classes in the evening

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
and he

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
take us in this room and it was

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
nothing but brass like from that end of the

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
everything was brass that was

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
left at the Cadif Museum I think

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
really I can remember about that yeah

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
they used to call it the brass room

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
that poor old maid used to have to

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
clean that I think

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
oh but it was so creepy and dark

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
and dungeon-y like it used to be

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
the death as a kid so were you

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
regular at the church then

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
yes I used to have to go to church yeah

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
because it used to be a church

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
that was a quick stroll down the fields for you though wasn't it

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
yeah and you had to

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
go down two fields

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
but

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
was the footpath there then

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
there was a footpath from you know

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
where the old school is in

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
on the Marshree Road

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
no

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
anyway

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
there was a footpath running from there

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
that's there all the way

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
right down from Marshree Road

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
right down to the church

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
well that footpath has been reopened up

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
oh have it? yeah

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
because Sir Forrester Walker and

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Stratton's all in big wigs guns

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
the Miss Guns

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
and his sisters

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
they kept you know the place in

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Castleton oh it's all houses

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
it used to be Craig O'Reilly

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
used to call it yeah

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
well that used to be the

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
oh the Miss Guns

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
used to live there belonging to another

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
big farm by the coach and horses

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
the Stratton's they owned a lot of

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
places

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
the Colonel would he be there? oh no

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Colonel was up in Wigleston

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
so there's all farms

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
around here?

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
there's all farms yeah

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
everyone you mixed with and went to school with

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
farm children

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
no a lot of

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
you know but the farms all

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
there's loads of farms around

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
there's one down Marshree that's gone now

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
I couldn't believe that the Grosse Farm

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Grosse

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
oh Grosse Corner

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
yeah it's all houses there no? yeah I know

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
a couple of years ago

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
so what sort of games

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
did you play as a child?

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
well you had the pheasant nest

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
I looked for

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
pheasant eggs, bird's eggs

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
well

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
most of the time we used to be in the

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
fields you know I always had a

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
well most everybody

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
you had a stick

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000
broomstick handle it

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000
and you'd go vaulting over the grips

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
in the field

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
so you could do the widest one

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
so you'd miss

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
well I used to do that

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
I used to do that in work as well

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
yeah well I can imagine

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
well we used to

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
when I first started working we used to do a job

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
called trashing

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000
called what John? Trashing

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
what's that?

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
that's what you're building now isn't it over the years?

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
I used to do that

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
what is it?

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
cut all the brambles off

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
the head with a

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
stick with a hook on it

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
I got my trashing hook on the back of the truck

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
you see that long hook sticking out?

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
that long bit of wood sticking out the back of my truck?

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
no didn't notice

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
I'll show you before you go that's my trashing hook

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000
like a sickle?

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
yeah sort of thing

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000
so if I want to get across the reed rather than walk around to the nearest gateway

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
and just jump and just propel yourself across the reed

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
yeah but my trashing hook was a short handed one

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
well you're short

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
that hook like that

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
and just a handle on it

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
and you'd have a stick in this hand

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
with a sort of a hook on it

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
like and you'd catch all the brambles

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
and you'd look behind them like that

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
and you'd cut them all down

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
and then you'd pull them all away like and burn them

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
and is that something you would have to do?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
your parents would have to do?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I'd have to keep the hedges and everything tidy like that

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
the drashing is cutting the banks

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
when you clear out the water course

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
actually get weeds out the course

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
that would be called scouring

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
dredging

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
yeah well it depends

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
again it's a very

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
local people even

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
locally you've got to have different names for it

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
but I would always call it scouring

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
scouring and drashing

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
drash the banks, scour the water course

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
drash the banks first and then the water course

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
and then the water course

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
drash the banks first and then scour

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
yeah now the word drashing

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
comes from

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I've got the details written down somewhere

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
many many years ago

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
they were form made

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
by inserting a hook

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
into a pole

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
and the piece of

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
like the ferrule that would go in was called

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
a drash eel

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
made of

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
and it'd be bound up with

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
read?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
no it'd be a shark skin

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
or something like that

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
not eel skin John

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
yeah because eel skin I've heard of eel skin

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
being used with something else

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
yeah so that's probably what it is

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
and that would be called a drash eel

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
a drash eel

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
maybe eel?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
possibly

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
that's interesting

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
what about a billock then?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
we always call a billock a single handed

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
small

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
a single handed thing for chopping down

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
quite thick brash

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
was it when you

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
were growing up here did it feel like

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
a

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
you know a very free childhood

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
you could go off and do?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
you went out through the door in the morning

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
your mother never bothered you

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
you'd come home when you were late

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
that's crazy I was like my childhood

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
we'd all just get a burger off

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
over the woods and what have you

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
come back when you wanted

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
everybody's scared to let their kids out

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
these days

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
kids these days are cosseted

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
if you were talking John wouldn't you

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
about picking blackberries

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
blackberries and jamsons

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
yeah I used to pick blackberries during the war

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
the people I used to know

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
like you know I had a stall in Cardiff Market

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
they'd give me a heap

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
of pinnits you used to call them

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
you know to put the fruit in

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
and I'd pick them then and I'd have

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
six pence of pennit for them

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
really?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
did you have the Americans coming here

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
at all? who? Americans

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
during the war? yeah

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
they were over a couple of

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
years away over here but

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I was in the farm then

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
during the war

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
did you ever see any you know

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
strafing or

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
searchlights or bombing?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
we lived it all it was terrible

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
bombs dropped

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
yeah right over

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
the house the one evening

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
we were washing up the milking

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
things we had a tin shed

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
like a tin corrugated place

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
where you used to call a cooling shed

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
for cooling the milk and everything

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
and then you had a pump of course for washing

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
all the things up

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
one would be turning the pump and one would be washing

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
the things we were bending over washing

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
up and looking up quick like this because

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
the searchlights they had one over here

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
one up on Penn

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Land one down Peterstone

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
or Bridestone here

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
all around you

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
when the sirens

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
went that lit up it was all

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
lit up you know the

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
searchlights had come on and the guns had been going

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
oh they'd blow the blinds off the

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
windows terrible

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
it was was it frightening?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
well I don't know it didn't seem to frighten

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
you didn't seem to be frightened you

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
used to it like I was ten when the

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
war broke out initially even

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
about

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
45 I suppose no

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
finished in 45 about 40, 42

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I expect and you had bombs dropping

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
around you yes

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
we were washing up this one night and all of a sudden

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
you hear them coming in

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
and it was like this waiting for them to

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
go off and they landed down by the

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
homes and they never went off

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
look thud thud it went on the floor

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
and they come the next morning

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
and blew them up

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
what the bombs? yeah because they hadn't

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
exploded oh yeah they

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
but they didn't make very

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
big I mean today I mean

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I mean it's nothing

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
really what

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
what it was then was nothing to what

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
it is today I mean it was a

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
they dropped a string of bombs

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
one night on the

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
rain coming along the last

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
year along there they blew

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
big holes in the rain there was fish

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
out on the rain sheep up in the

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
trees and all the

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
farms down here because

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
they used to put incendiary

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
bombs out look and it lighted all up

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
along here it would be like dairy

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
like fairy land

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
so was there much damage to the reams

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
or did anyone lose their homes

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I don't know

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
when they got bombed

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
when it was so spread about the railway

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
station they had a bomb there

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
on the bridge side of the bridge

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
and marsh there on that

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
by there they had a bomb dropped there

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
but we had loads of them my brother

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
used to go hunting then for

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
shrapnel and all stuff to keep

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
box it he found a

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
sentry bomb hadn't gone off

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
in the one field for that long

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
they were like

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
like an aluminium colour

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
like you know and the fins on

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
the top of it and he was walking around with

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
this blue and my father said get that

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
hunt and

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
he took it over to Fred Byrd's

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
over there do you remember Byrd's

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Scrappy's?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
well they were all together

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Byrd's and Scrappy's

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
no they had a farm they used to go around

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
that's how they used to do all the work in the farms

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
during the war

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
they had one tractor there was one tractor

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
in the area

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
the father

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
and the son sort of

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
bought it together like you know

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
and used to go around the farms cutting

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
the corn and doing the thrashing

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
and all that sort of thing

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
and they'd give it to Fred Byrd

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
to take the detonators out of it

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
so they'd done that

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
yeah they didn't have done a farm for years

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
yeah you said you knew the names of

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
fields did you know the names of

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
individual reams?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I didn't know the names of the reams

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
we never knew them

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
we only used to play in them

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
that's my department

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
the homes though is particularly queer

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
because as you know this whole area

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
is flat as a pancake

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
you know the homes isn't it?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
where is it John?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
just down the road yeah

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
about a mile away

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
it just doesn't make sense the whole area is flat

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
there's this big tump

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
you should have a reverend for it

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
there was a barrow or something

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
he thought there was a ship had been buried there or something

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
it's just odd

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
nobody ever investigated it

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
no nobody ever asked really

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
they'd excavated or anything have they

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
the army used to use it during the war

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
it was so flat and then you had this

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
they'd put their targets all along it

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
look and they'd be target

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
you know practice shooting and

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
things like that

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
what about fishing?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
did you ever do fishing on the reams?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
only with a jam pod

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
or the bamboo

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
with the nail in

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
after the flashes

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
but there was some biggie

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
my friends used to be able to get up from the sea like that

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
with the reams yeah and we used to see them

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
me and my brother we'd

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
a fashion of like a bamboo pole

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
with a nail on the end

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
spear them and bring them home and Terry'd eat them

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
with me yeah he'd trade them he didn't like it

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
though my eldest brother

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
he'd eat anything biggie eels caught

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
in there yeah cause

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
old Mr. Coyter used to

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
mend shoes for the you know years

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
ago he had a shed

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
do maching he used to do all his shoemaking

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
like you know yeah and

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
he used to go for the eels if he really

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
caught any

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Bill Lewis he was always a clotting

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
wasn't he? yeah

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I heard clotting

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
what is it?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
clotting is a way of catching eels

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
they dig the garden

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
catch all the worms and thread cotton

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
or something wool

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
thread them on wool and they've got

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
the teeth that come

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I've personally done it with dental floss

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
that's right so that would be called

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
a clot of worms okay

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
dropping in the reeds and lifting out the eels

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
teeth are stuck on the wool

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
it's an effective way of catching them yeah

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I remember dad

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
taking me down to watch Bill

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Lewis was it Bill Lewis?

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
yeah it would have been Bowsher

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
he'd be clotting and

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
fascinate me watching Philip his sack of

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
eels well Bill Lewis used

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
to work on the drainage board

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and I used to hear stories about him

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
he'd be taking on more eggs

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
to eat and stuff

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I heard that somebody the other day

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
his grandfather

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
this is at Roggett

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
his grandfather used to send him out to get

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
not moorhens

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
it was something like sky larks

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
or some sort of bird

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
egg I don't

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
think it was moorhens

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
well ducks

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
no it was a lapwing

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
something like

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
highly illegal

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
yes he said oh yeah but his

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
son because they were very rich

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
and his grandfather liked it he'd send his son out

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
we used to get

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
lots of them yeah I can remember

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
my brother and his friend years

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
ago because we used to tag on as well

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
when he was younger

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
they decided they were going to

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
get some birds eggs now

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
and have an omelette

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
so they made

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
this little fire now

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
in the field with the sticks across

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
it all right and they would go get

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
what we gonna cook them in

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
cook them in a tin

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
these omelettes

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
oh

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Colin Pretty was one

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
they got these eggs now and they cracked

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
they had all sorts of eggs

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
and they talked about a scrambled egg

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
they put it in this tin

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
and they would cook it on top

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
my brother failed to eat it

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
he didn't eat it

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Colin Pretty had his and Sid

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
was it raw?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
so how far is

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
how far so this is like

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
do you call this the moors or the levels?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
the moors we always called it

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
the moors so

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
what was it

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
special playground what was it

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
you know I know that you grew up with it but

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
what was it like

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I mean did you know about wildlife

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
did you know your flowers did you know your

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
animals? well that's where we got all our names from

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
we used to know a lot about flowers because

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
when you walk up the banks

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
you're walking up the lanes

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
and all you see all these different

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
flowers growing

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
what you could cooklepins we used to call them

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
in and lords and ladies

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
would be the others and

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
oh all sorts of wild

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
violets and

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
wild strawberries we used to eat the wild strawberries

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
only little things

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
and all that sort of thing

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
and what's changed then Valerie what's gone

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
has anything changed?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
everything's changed haven't it the wars

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
well he dug up well he vaulted all the

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
plants all the

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
all the roots that I used to know I bet

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
it's not there now are they I mean this for instance

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
this road going down there was a

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
was a lane

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
it wasn't a road it was just a

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
just a rough lane yeah

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
cobbles you know all stones and

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
everything and he said join that with

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
the road there that's right yeah

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
well this lane would just lead into

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
just countryside

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
with all lanes wouldn't it really

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
yeah well you'd get cars

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
drive down to Marshfield but you'd have like

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Castleton and Marshfield Peterstone

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
and St. Price but everywhere

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
in between would just be little farm buildings

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
and little lanes connecting them all

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
not the major roads

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
when you're talking about Green Lane the Green Lane

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
that I knew you know the farm

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
the gate that got GB on it

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
yeah the other

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
side of the road a bit further down there's a lane

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
going down there

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
that one goes to the

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Churchyard yeah

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Penning Lane I've always called that

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
we've always called it what do you mean to the

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Churchyard the Churchyard

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
for you the bottom of there you could get

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
the Monks Graveyard for you yeah

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
yeah Penning Lane yeah

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I've always called that Penning Lane no we always called it

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Green Lane that's what he said to you

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
can you get out down the bottom

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
you look on the maps

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
there's ever so many lanes

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
called Green Lane you've got Green Lane maps

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Penning Lane is called Green Lane

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
on the maps

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
lots of them are called Green Lane

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I know that word I was trying to think of

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
the belt they used to call them yeah belt

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
that's what we always call it the belt now

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
we've got the belt and the second belt

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
that's where the man go me did was the belt

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
yeah the belt yeah that's what we call it now

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
but the railway lane isn't it

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
if I asked somebody to go down there I don't say

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
go down Penning Lane I say pop down the belt

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
yes you always call it the belt

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
and you've got that

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
because you've got Penning Lane you've got

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Cozy Lane down in Peterstone

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
and they always used to run round

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
like one into the other didn't they

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
different places like you know

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
it's all so different

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
these lanes all still exist

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
they're just a lot of them are tarmac roads

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
now and yeah

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
you've got sort of a lot more

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
residential housing than they would have

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
been then haven't they yeah that's strange

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
all the new farmland

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
there was all the mostly farms

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
and farm labourers houses

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
and all of these was built

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
so six of these was built for the farm

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
really really yeah

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
what about

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
how far are we from the sea wall here

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
as the crow flies

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
one mile to the

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
purgoy the red arch

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
two and a bit

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
two and a bit miles

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
it wouldn't be three miles would it

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
might squeeze

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
three miles

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
have you ever gone down there to the sea wall

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
we almost don't go down there

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
that was an outing to go to

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
St. Brides

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
all the stuff down St. Brides when he was a kid

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
wasn't it yeah they had

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
they used to have

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
the shows come down there you know with the

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
roundabouts and all the shows

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
and everything what to St. Brides yeah

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
over the top of the sea wall yeah

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
that's right really yeah

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
and anybody knows about this but I was talking to

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
somebody the other day right and they said

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
to me I was talking to someone

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
they reckon they used to be fair

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
and stuff over the sea wall

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I said yeah really

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
they said yeah

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
the foundations the buildings are still

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
there now and what's left of the brick

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
walls and stuff and the little shops used to be

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
there that's right there were shops what you mean literally

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
over the top of the sea wall

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
really yes and people

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
used to come from miles didn't they to walk they'd

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
walk down there well I've walked

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
that was an outing that was a day's outing

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
do you know where's Dusk Lighthouse? Yes

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
do you know the lighthouse hotel?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Yes, yes

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
if you walked between the two of them

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
you walked round the top of the sea wall

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
on the seaward side you've got a bit of grassy

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
area yeah there

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
that's where it all used to happen so if you'd face

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
shadow bands take people from Newport

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
down there

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
that would be the local place

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
to go on a Sunday all the family would go

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
and that would be the exciting day out would be down there

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
and you see all the public

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
footpaths all head down towards there

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
loads of public footpaths that public

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
footpath the mam's on about down Penning

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Lane you carry on walking down there

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
then you go down the bridle path down

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Wheel Lane which then takes you across the road

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
and straight down to St. Brides

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
it comes out the back of the perl

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
and then you're along the top of the sea wall

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
and all these all these lanes

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
all these public footpaths they all head

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
down towards there

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
you go down there and you'd hope your mother'd

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
buy you something and the last time we went down

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I remember she bought me a bazooka

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
a long thing with a

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
you had one of them I remember them

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
it's a

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
like a long piece of metal

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
like that and you'd blow the end

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
like a whistle something but on the top it had

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
a little round thing with a

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
no you just made you

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
had to tut it with your

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
yourself like you

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
tut it that all the way home to hold the shirt up

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
so but certainly it was on the other side of the

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
sea wall you'd have you know a roundabout

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
and

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
and things like that

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
and shops and all

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
proper shops all that little fairground

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
stalls you know

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
and how long would they be there?

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
even I can remember the brick walls that were left from

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
those shops when I was a kid

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
and the foundations I haven't been down there

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
for a good few years

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
the foundations are still there

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
the ponds as well where the

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
old foundations used to be

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
yeah you go down in there

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
and you spend a few minutes there

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
with a metal detector

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
was it for a special

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
occasion was it like the main fair

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
mostly on the like holiday periods

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
bank holidays if you don't go down there

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
wouldn't they? so you get lots of people going

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
down there I know I was down there

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
down Peterstone when my friends used to

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
live in Peterstone so they all

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
decided they were going to walk to

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
St. Brides now to

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
the fair so of course

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I had to go with them didn't I?

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
walking from Peterstone now all along the seawall

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
right on the top of

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
the seawall all along there

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
and half way along

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
of course we had some addresses under me

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
it belted down we had a terrific

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
thunderstorm and I was petrified

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
of thunder in them days

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
oh god I never forgot it

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
yeah yeah I always

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
went down the seawall

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
did they have like

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
swings and rides

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
but what you have in the

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
not a great big one

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
like you know

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
there was horses up and down you know

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
going round oh how exciting

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
carousel is the word you like

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
carousel that's it

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
did you ever go swimming in the sea

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
or in the reens or anything like that?

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
it was too dirty yeah in the reens

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
the boys used to go swimming

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
because one got drowned down there

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
really? yeah

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
they reckon he was a very good swimmer apparently

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
that was in the sluice down Peterstone

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
are you talking about the Broadway?

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I'm talking about Peterstone now

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
it goes out to the sea

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
it used to be all mud and

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
sludge

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
yeah you walk off

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
the corner

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
where you come down from Marshfield

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
straight across

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
and along there over the stairs

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
down to Peterstone to the seawall

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
was that when you

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
were at? yeah when I was

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
oh you're talking about the gout

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Peterstone gout

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
yeah down there

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
yeah well I spent a bit of time

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
sliding down that mud myself

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
anyway they

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
got Dickie Loftus

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and that gang you know

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
and

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
what's Boeshe Lewis's boy

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Sid, Sid Lewis yeah

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
there was a gang of boys who used to go down there

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
swimming you know and this one boy

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
he lived halfway

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Marshfield Road you know and

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
there was two white houses

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
on the other side of the road that was built

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
for the soldiers

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Lionel Carly lived in one

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
opposite there

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
there was a big cottage there

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
and he lived there and

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
he was

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
with them as well and he was supposed to be a very

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
good swimmer but he had cramp or something

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
and anyway

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
he drowned and they said

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I don't know if it was true or not

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
that when they told his mother his mother

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
ran from there all the way

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
down to that sluice where he was

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
and collapsed and

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
she never

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
started coming to probably after

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
she was a bit funny like you know

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
yeah he was about

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
ten I think nine or ten

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
something like that they weren't very old

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
they had been two

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
drownedings down there got drowned

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
down Marshfield Lane

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Marshfield Road is it deep?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
is it deep?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
because the tide was in

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
that's true it's in yes

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
when it's you know there's no water

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
it looks huge it's all mud

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
both sides like you know

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
because in the winter

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
in the summer time the spring we used to

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
walk the cows now

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
from the farm all the way down

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
to this

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
lanes down here

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
and they had fields as I said

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
the farm yard

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
what do you call that place?

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
the

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Monksfield by there

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
but it was alongside the road we used to put

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
the cows the cows in there now

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
and then we'd have to go down twice a day

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
and work in the field really?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
you used to carry your stool down

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
you used to carry your stool sometimes you'd be

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
sat there on the stool and the cow would be over there

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
you'd go walking off

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
so they got to know

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
you know and you'd have

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
to turn in the fields would you?

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
just tip the milk in?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
yeah you'd have to do another van like you know tip it and then bring it on and cool it

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
and all the rest of it

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
even I can

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
remember chains being used

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
do you remember the M4

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
going in? do you remember that?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
yes that's where you got your hay fever from

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
that

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I can remember the M4

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
being built

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
why did you get hay fever from that?

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
because the verges of the

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
the road hasn't been cut at all

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
there was grass about that height

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
and they'd go I got up there now one night

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
and they'd go wow what are you doing now?

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
we had some sort of improvised sledge

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
so you were like flying down the banks

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
from all this grass

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
clouds of pollen and ever since then I've suffered with hay fever

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
really?

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I can remember going up there look before the M4

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
was built sledging down that huge

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
massive great slope

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
really John? Jesus Christ I wouldn't do it now

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I remember the speeds

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
we used to get up there now and I'd say

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
it was great fun when you're kids but Christ

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
did you also take a cardboard?

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
we had sledges

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
going up there on sledges

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
you feel it from the abandoned

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
barn up on the top with my lips there

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
what's the name of the farm?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Pettelhamn farm?

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
no

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Polcox farm

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
yeah Polcox what was the name of it?

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Kevnon

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Kevnon yeah

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
well from the top there

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
all the way down to

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
where the A48 is now

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
underneath where the motorway

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
just a huge great slope

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
snow wow

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
the speeds you get up to

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
great knack speeds

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
any of us would have killed

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
yeah and you see Russell

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
drop over 40 foot off a swing

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
up there into a rocky

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
stream

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
so do you living here

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
do you see yourself

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
do you get Wendt Lug levels

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
and you get Keljikop levels do you feel

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
you're part of the same area or do you feel

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
different too?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
well since this

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
it's not the same

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
like we're doing a dip

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
where you could see

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
right out

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
and then we had these people come

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
next door recently

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
put a big fence

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
up as well I don't like

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
what you girls been thinking about it?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
the thing about it is they're not back

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
back years ago

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
people didn't have cars

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
didn't have phones

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
they lived on the other side of Newport

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
you're not going to see them

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
it was very very much your very local community

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
and

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
you know people from Peterstone

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
they wouldn't know many people from St. Price

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
very very isolated

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
communities

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
and Marshall would have been like the biggest

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
village on the

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Wendt Lug levels

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
it's huge

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
it's massive

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
you see two streets before

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I can remember when the terrace was built

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
yeah I do too

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
so all it was was just one street

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
and a collection of houses really

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
there was a big sprawling

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
sort of

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Sandy Lane's gone that was a farm

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
wasn't it

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Sandy Lane?

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Dufferin?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
no I'm talking about Marshall Road

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Sandy Lane?

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
yeah

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
your latest, oh god

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
a farm called Sandy Lane

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Goff Jones used to have it

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
where by?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
no you come down past the school

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
down the school

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
you go so far down the road and

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
there's some cottages on the side

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
on the left?

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
on the right going down

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
on the side

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
go down past the school

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
and there's a corner

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
you go round the corner didn't you?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
yeah when Nicky Walden always used to live

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
on the left

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
not as far as there back here before you turn the corner

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
that corner was called

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Sandy Lane Farm Goff Jones had that

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
used to come over

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
to have extra milk off us because he didn't have

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
enough milk to his customers

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
yeah

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
you go

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
to it

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
as I said just past the school you go down so far

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
there's a lane down there?

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
yeah well that's Sandy Lane

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I know that lane Lionhall Collier had on the ground down here

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
you go round the back of those cottages

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
that's right Sandy Lane

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
and the farm was the end one

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
where did you go to school then Val?

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Marshfield

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
what was that like?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
well it was just a village school it was during the war

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
during the war?

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
when I was

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
ten when war broke out

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
but you never had any

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
schooling during the war

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
we didn't anyway all we had was

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
piles of

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
leaflets

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
to put in envelopes to send out

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
to people there was wings for victory

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
walls

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
have ears

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
dig for victory

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
what was the other one? you knew them all off

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
my dad had forgotten them all I don't know

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
and you had to put these in envelopes

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
and send them up

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
and then

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
perhaps all of a sudden the bells would go

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
and you'd have to

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
run then and see how fast

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
you could get to your nearest

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
shelter like you know or whatever

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
things like that

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
we never done any

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
schooling

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
so how old were you when you left school?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
fourteen

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
where did you go then?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
on the farm to work

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
well that's

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
my father died that year

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
he was fifteen

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
because I was with him

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
they used to have

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
market garden as well

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
and they used to take

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
stuff in on a Friday

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
and then Tuesday I think it was

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
my father had been ill

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
for a long time

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
and he couldn't find out what was wrong with him

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
they took him to hospital and they removed

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
part of his lung

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
and his death

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
certificate

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
said preliminary TB

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
but I don't

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
think they knew what he had

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
but in later life as time went on

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
the farmers was dying look

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
with the same thing

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
there was I think four from Marshfield

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
died all with the same thing look

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
and they found out after

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
it was farmers lung

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
they called it farmers lung

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
what it was caused from

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
you're talking about the mows

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
if they weren't thatched properly

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
or a hole getting them

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
and the rain go down

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
in the top

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
you'd have a

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
strip all the way down here would be

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
foasty or mold

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
look

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
you have a big hay net

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
to cut your

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
hair into squares

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
you get that off

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
and you'd shake it off

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
and you'd take the weight

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
it's a wonder they never had it because they shook enough of it

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
and my father

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
he used to do the

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
hay cutting and things like that

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
and it used to stick together

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
it was real wet moldy gone

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
and dried out some of it

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
and that's what they found it was

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
the spores from the hay

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
they call it farmers lung because they all died

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
with the same symptoms look

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
so what did your mother do then?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
she lived here she was 97

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
she lived on the farm?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
no she never even seen a cow till after my father died

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
never went to the cowshed

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
really?

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
she was frightened to death of horses

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
what did she do then?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
pardon?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
she lived in Cardiff when she

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
she was a country person

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
frightened to death of it

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
and the horses knew it they chased it everywhere

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
running down

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
a lane with a

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
with Derek in a push chair and the horse chasing a

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
nobby?

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
so because you were tenants

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
you had to get off the farm then did you?

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
when your father died?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
no no no

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
it was in my grand's name actually

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
ok

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
no

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
they weren't one tenant

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
my grandfather

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
was the actual tenant he died

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
and he went on to her look and then to the

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
two sons sort of thing

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
so what did you do

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
you stayed working on the farm did you?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
