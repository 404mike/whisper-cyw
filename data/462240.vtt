00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920
Of all the things you've seen on television over the years, what has had the greatest impression and why?

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.400
Being a Welshman it would probably be Wales during the 70s and even the Grand Slams of

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.820
recent years. I mean, you know watching some of these fabulous players

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.620
like Gareth Edwards and Barry John and Phil Bennett

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.760
from the sporting point of view, yes that. From

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.380
more serious matters

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.860
probably it's got to be

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.420
the 9-11. I mean that was

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.380
horrific

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.700
and to think of what people had to suffer

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.660
and what people did suffer at that time

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.460
and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.060
that was

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.980
I do remember that obviously and I feel that was significant.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.700
A very significant thing that you could see live. You could see people being killed

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.980
sadly in an awful way live

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.460
terrorism brought into your front room and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020
when you see it like that it

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.060
yes, it's probably the most significant thing I've seen.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.660
