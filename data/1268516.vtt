00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
To dream impossible dream, To hide the unbeatable hope,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:28.000
To learn where the brain and the sorrow, To learn where the brain and the hope,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.000
To right yet right but wrong, To love you and taste for the heart,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:50.000
To try the path that will lead me, To reach the abyss of a slough,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is my path, no path, no matter how hopeless, no matter how far,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I could ride without question or cause, To be ready to march into hell on a heavenly cause,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.000
At my heart will I be so uncome when I'm late to my rest,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And the world will be better for this, That one man, strong and covered with stars,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Still strong with his last ounce of courage, To reach the unbeatable path.
