a'n gweithio'n ddiffyniad,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900
a'r hyn yn ddiffyniad,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.900
oherwydd, rydym yn aelodau,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.900
gyda fy fath oedd yn ymlaen,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.900
yn y ffactor,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.900
yn y ffactor,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.900
roedd yna ddau pan oeddwn i ddim yn fferwyr yn y ffactor,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.900
ac felly,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.900
roedd y penderfyniad oedd yn cael ei ddangos i'r ffactor,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.900
ond roedd yn ddangos i'r ffactor,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.900
yn ddangos,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.900
yn ddangos,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.900
yn ddangos,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.900
roedd hi'n gallu gweithio fel ddŵr,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.900
ond roedd hi ddim wedi cael unrhyw ffactor,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900
ac roedd fy fath oedd yn ddangos iawn,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900
felly, rwy'n credu bod hi'n cael ei ddangos i fy nghymru,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.900
a fyddwn i'n gwneud rhywbeth ffisigol yn fy mhlyf.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.900
Yn ogystal â'r educaeth,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.900
a allwch chi ddweud am y, ysgol ymlaen,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.900
ysgol ysgol ysgol,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.900
roeddwn i'n dechrau,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.900
ond roeddwn i'n dechrau i fynd i fy nghymru yn ymlaen,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.900
a allwn i'n dechrau i fy nghymru,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.900
oherwydd roeddwn i wedi cael ymwneud â phobl yn ffyrdd eraill,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.900
yn y gymnasgau yn ymgysgol.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.900
A yna pan oedd fy gymnasg ymddiriedaeth i fynd,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.900
ac roeddwn i wedi'i llwybru iawn i'r gêm olympic.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.900
Roeddwn i'n mynd i ddweud ysgol.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.900
Mae'n gofnod y ffactor.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.900
Mae'n mynd i'r ddwyll.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.900
A roeddwn i'n mynd i ddweud ysgol,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900
a roeddwn i wedi mynd i ddweud ysgol,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.900
felly roeddwn i'n meddwl ei bod ni ddechrau'n cael y gwirionedd

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.900
i wella'r teimloedd gysylltu,

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.900
os oeddech chi'r holl gwaith i wneud,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.900
ac roeddwn yn mynd i fod yn gofnod ar hyn,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.900
a roeddwn i ddim yn ffyrdd â llwyddo a chymniad,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.900
felly rwy'n mynd i ddweud ysgol ysgol oedd ysgol i mi,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.900
a dwi'n ei ddweud.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.900
Felly roeddwn i'n gweithio yn Boots the Chemist.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.740
Roeddent yn cael ei ddod yn ystod yno, roeddent yn cael ei ddod yn ystod yno.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.500
Roeddent yn cael ei ddod yn ystod yno, ac roeddent yn ystod yno.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.620
Ond yna, wrth gwrs, roeddent yn traenu ar ddodau.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.380
Pan y traenu yn cael eu cymryd, roedd y cymryd i'r Olympec yn cael ei ddod.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.940
Roeddwn ni'n cymryd, fel rydych chi'n dechrau, gyda'r sgwad mwyaf.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.900
A'r hyn yn ystod, mae pobl wedi'i ddod yn ystod, a'r hyn yn ystod.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.100
Roedd yna traelau a phobl yn ystod yna, felly roeddent yn traenu'r holl beth.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.740
A oedd yn dda i'n ddod, a'n dda i'n ddod yn ystod, a'n ddod yn ystod,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.820
ar y Olympec yn 1952, a'r hyn yn dda i'n ddod yn ystod,

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.460
a'r hyn yn dda i'n ddod, a'r hyn yn dda i'n ddod,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.460
roeddwn i'n ddod yn Grangetown, yn dda i'n ddod yn ystod,

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.300
a'r fflagiau yn dod, a'r cyllideb yn ystod,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.400
wedi allan i ioniau tu allan i ni fod yr un a

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.140
tetrefiaeth dir �제 ar tydd Igor Feolai,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:05:13.940
a wir yn deud i mi

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.940
Oherwydd yna oedd llawer o ffysau wedi'i wneud amdano,

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.940
roedd ymlaen, y ffrind o fy mwyr, y ffrind yma o'i ffyrdd,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.940
roedd y ffrind yn ei chymdeithas, a dweud y gallai ei ddod i gael gwaith i mewn ffatriad.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.940
Roedd yn cael bsa gweithiau, roedd nhw'n gwneud ymgyrchau cyfnodol a'r microscopiau,

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.940
a phwyaf o bethau yno.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.940
Roeddwn i'n gweithio ymlaen ac roedd nhw'n gweithio i mi ymlaen,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.940
nid oes unrhyw gweithiau, ond gyda'r gwaith,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.940
a oedd yn rhywbeth yn ystod y maes, gyda'r gwaith.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.940
Oherwydd nid oedd y gwaith yn ysgol, y gallai hynny.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.940
Roeddwn i'n gweithio, bob amser, i gael triel neu beth,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.940
oedd yn ymwneud â'r aml, cyfnodol, newydd newydd i'w gael,

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.940
roedd fy mwyr yn cael ei ddod i gael, roedd yna'r arian yw'r ffyrdd ymlaen.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.940
Roedd hynny'n gweithio, ond, nid oes unrhyw gwaith,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.940
ond, rwy'n credu, os yw'r gwaith bsaid dda i ddod i gael,

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.940
roeddwn i wedi'i ddod o'r ffordd, i fod yn dda, oherwydd roedd yna'n ffrindiau i mi,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.940
a'r arian yna'n ffrindiau i mi oedd yn dda,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.940
roedd yna'n ffrindiau i mi oedd yn dda,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.940
a roeddwn i wedi'i gael, roeddwn i wedi'i gael, felly roedd hynny'n dda.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.940
Dwi'n mynd i, yn y ffordd y byddwn ni'n mynd i,

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.940
beth ysgol ydych chi'n mynd i?

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.940
Ysgol Llynian Park am yr Ysgol Llynian.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.940
Roedd ysgol Llynian Park yn y ffordd yma,

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.940
a'n dda, roedd ysgol yma wedi bod yn ffyrdd yn y ffordd,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.940
felly roedd yna rhan o'r ffordd yn dda,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.940
ond roedd ysgol newydd wedi bod yn dda i'r Ysgol Llynian,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.940
yn Penelan, a'n dda i'w ddod i gael,

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.940
ond roedd ysgol yma yn ymddangos i'r Ysgol Amaricain.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.940
Felly pan ddod i, roedd yn dda i fod yn y ffordd ym mhob,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.940
yn y ffordd yma, ond yn y ffordd yna,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.940
a'r unrhyw ffordd i fi wneud yw gynnigio rhai o'r amser fy nghymdeithas,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.940
ac yn y ffordd yma, ond rwy'n siŵr

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.940
ei fod yn ddigonol y pethau'n dda i'w wneud,

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.940
ond roedd ymlaen i'w wneud, felly roeddwn i'n mynd i ysgol

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.940
i fod yn gallu gysylltu ar fy nghymdeithas,

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.940
ac roeddwn i'n mynd i'r amser, ond roedd yn y ffordd yma,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.940
roeddwn i'n fwyaf risgol oherwydd nad oedd yn cael ei ddod,

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.940
ond roeddwn i'n credu bod fy nghymdeithas yn dda i fod yn dda.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.580
A oedd y ganddoch chi'ch barod wedi bod yn 100% eich bod allan ychydig!

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.600
Mae llawer o brydau yn cael eu cymryd â hyn o brydau yma.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.600
Roeddwn i'n cael fy hun asymetriol fy hun yn y gardd,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.600
roeddwn i'n mynd yn dda iawn, roeddwn i'n cael ei ddod yn dda.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.600
Roeddwn i gael llawer o bryd, roeddwn i'n ffortunol iawn.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.600
Mae'n dda iawn.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.600
Felly roeddwch chi'n mynd i'r brifysgol.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.600
Beth ydych chi'n cael y gwaith, roeddwch chi'n dweud?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.600
Mae fy marn i'n ddod yn Llyfrgell, mae fy marn o'n bryd yn y gwaith,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.600
roedd wedi'i gweithio yn y gwaith gyda'r ddangos.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.600
Roedd nhw'n cael ymddygiad yn y gwaith,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.600
ac roedd yn ddweud eich bod i'n mynd i fynd i'r ddangos

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.600
ac afael iddo gwaith yn y maes gyda mwyaf o'r arian yma.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.600
Rwy'n cymryd y gallwn ddweud, roedd hi'n dda yn rhaid i'w gyd.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.600
Felly roeddwn i'n twnod â'r ddangos sy'n cael eu cymryd,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600
mae hynny'n rhan o'r clwp ddangos.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.600
Roedd yn gwybod rhywun, dwi ddim yn ei chael, yn BSA Tools,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.580
a'i ddweud am fy mhoblwm,

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.580
a dweud y byddwn yn cael ei gweithio oherwydd hynny.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.700
Ond roedd yn cael ei ddweud yn cael llawer o ddwy o fath o fy mod i'n treinio.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.660
Rwy'n meddwl, pan oeddwn yn mynd i'r Olympecau yn 1952,

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.440
yn y ffordd o'r ffaith, roedd yn rhanfawr,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.380
a bob amser oeddwn yn mynd i'r treinio ystod y gallai,

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.620
ond efallai roedd yn Yorkshire,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.440
roedd yn mynd i'ch cwpwm y ffyrdd yma,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.740
a hynny'n rhanfawr.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.660
A roedd y ffyrdd,

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.660
roedd y ffyrdd yn cwpwm ymlaen,

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.660
ond pan oeddwn yn mynd i'r Olympecau,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.660
roeddwn yn cael blazer,

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.660
dros ymwneud â'r ddrys ymgyrch,

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.660
y hat, y bag,

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.660
a chymysg ymlaen,

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.660
a lles o ddau o bethau oeddwn i'n cael ei ddweud.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.660
Blos, glwb, sylfaen,

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.660
a chymysg ymlaen.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.660
Roedd yn rhanfawr iawn i'w wneud,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.660
felly roedd fy ffrindiau wedi'i gynhyrchu'n bach,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.660
yn eich bod i fynd ymlaen.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.660
Roeddwn yn fwy fwy o bwysig,

oherwydd roeddwn yn credu bod roeddwn yn

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.660
yn cymryd rhywbeth i'w gyrraedd,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.660
ond fel rhanfawr, roeddwn yn cwpwm ymlaen.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.660
Felly roeddwn yn gweithio yn y ffyrdd?

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.660
Ymlaen, roeddwn yn ffyrdd yn y ffyrdd.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.660
Roedd yn fyrdd yn y ffyrdd yn y ffyrdd.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.660
Roeddwn yn gweithio o ran ymlaen.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.660
Roeddwn yn gweithio yn y ffyrdd yng nghymdeithas.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.660
Roeddwn yn cael llawer o ddwyllau

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.660
i gyrraedd, oherwydd roeddwn yn chweithio

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.660
mewn amser mewn fy nghymdeithas.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.660
Felly beth yma fe'n gweithio yma?

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.660
Roeddwn yn acor arfer ymddygiad metod.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.660
Rwy'n credu bod roedd yn ffatri bach.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.660
Roedd nhw'n gwneud llawer o ddwylo

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.660
ac roedd nhw'n ysbysiadol hefyd

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.660
mewn gweithgwyr cymdeithasol

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.660
ac ymddygiad laburig.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.660
Mae'n fwy o microtoscopiau a pethau fel hyn.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.660
Roeddwn wedi'i gwneud rhywbeth

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.660
i mi, er mwyn ni allu gwneud rhan newydd,

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:55.140
ac roeddwn yn cael ymdrech i fynd i'r stiwllion yma i gyd yn ymdrech i'r materiol.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:04.060
Felly roedd fy gweithdol yn ymddrechio'r hyn a'i gweithio yn y bwc a'i gweithio yn ymdrechio bod y stiwllion yma yn aelod i gael ymdrech i fyddai'n mynd i'w ddod.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.060
Felly roeddwn yn dda iawn iawn.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.540
Roeddwch chi'n ei fwynhau'r gweithdol?

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.500
Ie, roeddwn i'n ei fwynhau. Roedd y menywod wedi'i ddod. Felly roedd hynny'n fwy fwy.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:19.740
Felly mae'n waith y f Solar i fewn f 1959 Fythais.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.460
Roeddwn yn gyfrannol.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:32.700

Roedd istediwyd F cercwyd complet nice accessories er maint o', ac felly fel cyfweld diawn yn rhan brofi gael cyflym.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:47.060
Mae'n rhan o'r uned y byddai fy môr yn gweithio yn y ddau amser, pan oedd yn gwneud ychydig lles lles.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:55.060
Roedd ganddyn nhw wedi'i gwych o ddau o ddau munisiynau.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.060
Roedd yn un o'r ddau.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.060
Dwi ddim yn gwybod a yw'r cyfnod yn edrych. Dwi'n gwybod bod y ddau yw'n ddau.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.060
Mae'r pwynt yn ddwy.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.060
Roedd gennych chi'n gwybod am y gwaith?

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.060
Ie, roedd gen i gyd yn ymwneud.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.060
A oedd gennych chi rhywbeth amdano?

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.060
Nid oes llawer. Dwi'n credu bod nhw'n fwy fwy o'n ddau amser fy môr gymnastig,

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.060
yn y pethau unrhyw beth.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:25.060
Roedd nhw ddim yn gallu gwybod unrhyw un, oherwydd roedd i'n 4 a 11 mwy.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.060
Roedd yn gallu bod yn gwneud yr hyn a allwn i'w wneud.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:35.060
Ond mae gymnas yn gweithio'n fwy o'r ddau, yn fwy fwy o'r statiw.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.060
Roedd yn cael ei gweithio ar y gwaith, ond roedden nhw'n credu ei fod yn angen i fod yn unrhyw amser,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.060
ond nid oes angen.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:47.060
Felly, ydych chi'n dweud y byddai'n gweithio'n dda i chi'r ffactor?

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.060
O, i.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.060
Why do you think that was?

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:56.060
Well, I'd like to think it was because they wanted someone in Cardiff to be in the Olympic Games.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.060
But I can't really say I know.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:04.060
It might just have been jobs for the boys because this gentleman that had made the request

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:09.060
for them to find me a job, I mean, I don't know what contacts he had with the company

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.060
or with whom within the company either.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.060
So I don't know.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.060
But yes, they were supportive.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.060
And then if I needed extra time off for training, you know, sometimes it was a training away

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.060
and you'd travel up on a Friday, they were quite happy for me to go.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.060
So they were very good, very good.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:32.060
British Small Arms, BSA was for, British Small Arms, it was the full name of the company.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.060
British Forlamp Tools, BSA Tools.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.060
So, and what was your exact work then?

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.060
Did you say clarking?

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.060
Yes, clarking. Clarking, that was all.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:49.060
I used to have to walk down the factory with the steel stores if it looked as if they were running out of something

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:54.060
and then the men used to whistle in time with my feet all the way down, you know, to torment me.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:59.060
But yes, it was just really, I suppose it was quite responsible in a way

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:04.060
because I had to make sure that all the materials and there were so many different metals and things

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.060
that were required for the various jobs that they were always stocked there.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:12.060
Not that I ordered the stock, I would pass on the need and someone else would do the ordering.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.060
So I suppose it was quite responsible really.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:21.060
And I was the only one doing it, so, you know, I was making sure, well, giving them the notes

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:26.060
in order to acquire the metals they needed for every job that was going on in the factory.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.060
So I suppose it was quite responsible.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:33.060
I can't say I felt great weight of responsibility at the time, but when I think of it now,

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.060
I mean, if they'd have had the wrong metal for a start, I'd have been up the road in no time.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.060
I thought you were going to say in for the high jump.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.060
Yes, that would have been a good thing for me, yes.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.060
How did you feel about the man's behaviour?

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.060
Did you find it threatening?

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.060
No, no, it was all in good fun.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:15:02.060
They usually used to whistle in time in my feet, you know, and however I changed my walk,

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.060
they would adjust the rhythm and they would call out to me, you know,

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.060
are you coming out with me tonight and things like that.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:12.060
But there was never anything offensive or abusive and I never felt threatened.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.060
And there was nothing physical?

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.060
No, no, no. They were very protective of me actually.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.060
I think perhaps because I was little and young, they were very protective.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.060
Maybe some of the older girls had a bit more epinomy anyway.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.060
That was the Charlie Chaplin tune, was it?

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.060
Yes.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.060
I had to dee da dee da as I went down.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:39.060
What about, were there other local people working in the factory that?

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.060
Yes, I think a lot of the people that worked there were local.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.060
But of course some of the skills were quite acute because they used to make instruments,

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.060
surgical instruments and things like that.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:55.060
So although I'm quite sure part of their work was large scale work,

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:59.060
when it came to the intricate making of things,

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.060
they could quite possibly have been shipping specialists for that.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.060
I really wouldn't know.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:09.060
Most of the office for that factory were upstairs except mine.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.060
Well, I wasn't the only one in it, but the office I was in was the only one

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.060
that was actually on a factory floor for convenience, for its purpose.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:23.060
I don't think the others came in contact with the men much at all.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.060
There were no women working in a factory at all.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.060
On the floor?

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.060
On the floor, none.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.060
What about women in the office? Were there women in the office?

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:38.060
Yes, there were women there as well doing various jobs to do with orders and things like that,

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.060
things that were coming in that needed to be done.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:46.060
Mine was just a small part of that, just making sure the materials were there for them

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.060
and that they could access them when they needed.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:55.060
There was a...what do you call it?

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:02.060
Down the end, like a big forge where they melted stuff and they can't remember the name of that big one.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.060
Furnace?

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.060
Furnace. There was a big furnace down the end.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:12.060
Down the end. The man fell in, actually, the molten liquid, molten metal while I was there.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.060
Didn't find any of him at all. Just disappeared.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.060
Oh.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.060
But I wasn't a witness to that.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:28.060
No. Can you remember your first day at work and what your impressions were of...

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.060
What, the first day in BSA?

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.060
In BSA, yes.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:39.060
I was very nervous because I didn't know anything about the company

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.060
or anything about what I was going to have to be doing.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:48.060
So I suppose I was nervous in a way, but there was a lady who had been doing that job for some time

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:53.060
that was retiring and she was very good. She sort of helped me get to grips with it before she left.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:18:00.060
So they gave me an opportunity for some training with her before I was left on my own to deal with it.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:05.060
But no, it wasn't a comfortable office because it was on the factory floors.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:11.060
It wasn't carpeted or, you know, it was a bit dirty at times because there was a lot of metal dust

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.060
and so it would come up because it didn't have a lid on our office if you wound up to the roof.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.060
But no, I was quite happy there.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:21.060
How long did the training go on for?

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.060
Oh, just about three weeks, I think. That was about it.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:30.060
And then of course there was a scene that the manager of that particular department was in a side office half hours.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.060
So if I'd have had any trouble I could have sought help there, I'm sure.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:38.060
But I can't remember needing to do it. It wasn't a difficult job.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:43.060
But do you feel that you were well trained by then?

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:49.060
Not really because the lady who did it with me, she made sure that I understood it all.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.060
But nobody checked after that, it was okay.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.060
So we looked at it like that way.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.060
There was no... I suppose you could say they were trusting.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.060
How were the physical appearance of the building?

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:08.060
You've told me how you felt, but when you walked in there, what was it?

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.060
Can you describe it?

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.060
Oh yes, it was quite dismal.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:18.060
It was like a corrugated building really with some concrete walls and things.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:24.060
It was an old munitions factory and they threw them up in the wall because of the need.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:29.060
So there weren't any finer points to it.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:35.060
The girls in the office upstairs had more amenable surroundings.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.060
But I can't say I ever felt that we were neglected in any way.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.060
There was a canteen there that catered for us very well.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.060
Otherwise to go home for lunch on my bike.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:53.060
But yes, it was a typical dusty, noisy factory.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.060
It was noisy, was it?

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.060
Yes, some parts of it were noisy.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.060
The end where they made the fine instruments was at our end and that was quiet.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.060
But as you went down, it got noisy.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.060
What about the smell? What did it smell of?

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.060
It smelled dreadful when I first went there, but I got used to it then.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.060
I've had a phone and didn't smell it at all then.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:17.060
So yes, it was just an oily, engineering-type smell.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.060
Nothing really offensive.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.060
When I first went there, I wasn't too keen, but as I say, I got used to it.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.060
It didn't matter.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.060
What did the women in the offices upstairs do then?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.060
They did all sorts of paperwork.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:35.060
There was a drawing office there because they were designing things,

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:40.060
designing equipment and implements and so on.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.060
There were mostly men up there in the drawing office,

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.060
but there were some women there as well,

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.060
and clerical workers and secretaries and so on.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:52.060
To be honest, we didn't have any reason not to,

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.060
but we didn't have a great deal to do with them.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.060
We could see them in the county, but when we went,

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:03.060
there were four men and three women in that county myself where I was.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:07.060
So when we went for our break, we three were always together on the table talking.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.060
We'd speak to the others, but we didn't really have a lot to do with them.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.060
Were the drafts women there as well?

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.060
I think there was one. The rest were all men.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:23.060
I think the woman was only really there because there was no photocopy.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.060
They had a machine that turned around the ink.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.060
I forget what they called that.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.060
It was like a sort of copy machine.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:35.060
The lady that was there did a bit of drawing,

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:39.060
but to be honest, I think she did most of that sort of thing.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:44.060
Can you remember how much you were paid?

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:52.060
No, I can't. It was only just a few pounds. It wasn't a lot.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.060
How did it seem to you at that age though?

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.060
It was more than I was getting in boot to the chemist,

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.060
so I was quite pleased about that.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.060
But it really was just juniors rate.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.060
I think I was only considered to be a junior,

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:14.060
although when I look back on it now, it was a fairly responsible job to get it right.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.060
So what did you do with your money?

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.060
I lived at home.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:26.060
My mother used to put my money aside for me so that I could get the train

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.060
towards my training and things.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:33.060
As I say, when I went to the games, there was a great list of things to buy.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.060
It was an expensive business.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:43.060
If you had to get there on your own, it was your train fare.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:47.060
My mum would never let me go if I needed a new coat until I had a new coat,

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.060
that sort of thing.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.060
Then there was always a gift for the lady you'd be staying with,

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.060
because someone would put you up there.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.060
My mother would cry because she had to part with her tea coupon

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.060
and I didn't drink tea.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:06.060
But as far as the money was concerned, it sort of went in this pot.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:11.060
My parents didn't have any of it.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:15.060
They just used it as part of the support that I needed,

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.060
and it was only a small part of the support I needed.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:26.060
I was going to ask, were there any unions in the factory?

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.060
Were you aware of anything?

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.060
I wasn't aware of it.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.060
There must have been for the men, I would think,

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.060
because they had several professions there.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.060
So they must have been for the men.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.060
But I was certainly not asked to join a union.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.060
So you weren't in a union?

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.060
I wasn't in a union.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.060
And you weren't aware of an office union, were you?

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.060
No.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.060
Did you feel that you were fairly treated?

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.060
Yes, I was quite happy there.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.060
Do you feel that everybody was fairly treated?

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.060
Yes, the ones that I knew.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.060
I didn't hear no one complain.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.060
I can't see much about the men in the factory,

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.060
because I really wouldn't know anything about them.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.060
But in our office, everyone seemed to be okay.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.060
Were you aware of any disputes, though?

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.060
No, never.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:21.060
I was there until I was 19.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.060
During that time, I wasn't aware of any.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.060
I did have a good deal of help on one occasion,

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.060
because I used to ride a bike to work,

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.060
and we had a terrible snowstorm.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:36.060
When I was in school, I never missed a half-day school,

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.060
all my education.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.060
My parents, my mother, would say,

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.060
you'll feel better by the time you get there.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.060
I never even lost a half-day in the whole of my schooling.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.060
I think that stayed with me.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:51.060
It helped me with my gymnastics and with the rest of my future.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.060
It taught me commitment.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:58.060
So the snow came pouring down, and I got on my bike to go.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.060
As I turned a corner, I lived in Grangetown.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.060
It was a Grange garden, it says to cycle past.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.060
As I turned the corner, so this great lot of snow flew in my face.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.060
I put my head down and went into the back of a tractor on my bike.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.060
I was clean over the top and knocked myself out.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.060
So the parkkeeper took me into his hut.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.060
I mean, he wouldn't dare do it today, would they?

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.060
But the parkkeeper took me into his hut

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.060
until he felt I was well enough to get up,

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.060
and he wanted me to go home.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.060
But he said, no, I must go to work. I'm on my way to work.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.060
So I pushed my Brent bike to work.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.060
When I got there, they were so concerned about me,

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.060
they wanted me to go up to the hospital,

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.060
which in those days was St David's Hospital.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:47.060
So the boss had a Rolls and a chauffeur,

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.060
so I had my first ride in a Rolls-Royce,

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.060
going to the hospital with my concussion.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.060
And did you have concussion?

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.060
Yes, I had concussion.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.060
And this was before the games, was it?

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.060
No, that was after.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.060
That was after.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:07.060
You talked a bit, I'll just ask you about this,

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.060
because you talked a bit about this man

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.060
who had a dreadful injury and well disappeared.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:19.060
Were you aware of any other injuries on the factory floor?

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.060
No, I don't think I was.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.060
I mean, they had a nurse on site,

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.060
and there used to be, I think,

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:30.060
there was a man who once got his hands caught in a machine,

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.060
because they used to be after a bit dangerously,

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.060
and sometimes worked without a guard down

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.060
because the guard made the job difficult.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.060
And there was one man who caught his hands in there.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.060
But apart from that dreadful one where the man disappeared,

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.060
I don't recall any more.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.060
There must have been, but there would have been

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.060
small and insignificant injuries, I would think.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.060
Do you think the work was dangerous?

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.060
It must have been in some instances,

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.060
if the man could catch his hand

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.060
and if somebody could fall in there.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.060
But my job wasn't dangerous.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:15.060
So let's go on to the hours and the holidays.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.060
So how many days did you work a week?

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.060
Five. And it was nine till five.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.060
Clock in and clock out.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.060
You had to clock in, did you? Yes.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.060
And were there any shifts worked?

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.060
Were you aware of that?

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.060
No. I don't think even the factory workers worked shifts.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.060
I think there were set hours there.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.060
I would imagine if they had an emergency

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.060
or a big order that had to be met,

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.060
people would have turned to.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.060
But I think as a general rule it stuck to.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.060
But the men had longer hours.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.060
They started at eight, I think, in the morning,

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.060
and we started at nine.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.060
And I think they finished about the same time as us.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.060
So if they did have, I presume they'd work a bit of overtime

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.060
if they had an order,

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.060
would you ever be asked to work out?

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.060
No. Because I just have to make sure that the material

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.060
that they needed after hours was available to them.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.060
There. Right.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.060
And did you have any breaks to review working day?

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.060
Yes. We had a tea break.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.060
We had a canteen,

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:24.060
but we used to get a tea or coffee and bring it to the office.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.060
And then of course there was a lunch break

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.060
and there was a canteen there.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.060
But I didn't.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.060
I didn't have my bike.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.060
It was the top end of Grangetown near town

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.060
and I lived in Clive Street, which was not so far away.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.060
So I used to go home on my bike and come back.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.060
How long would it take you on the bike?

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.060
About a quarter of an hour each way.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.060
And we had an hour for lunch, so it was enough.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.060
And you always went home, did you?

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.060
Usually, yes. Sometimes I went into town,

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.060
I did a bit of shopping because it wasn't far.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.060
But it wasn't much of a shopaholic then.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.060
So I didn't do much of that.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.060
You had your mind on greater things.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.060
So you never used the canteen then, did you?

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.060
Yes, I did occasionally, but mostly just for coffee.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:10.060
And I had to get the boss' teas and coffees every day.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.060
And he hated it if I brought him back biscuits with currants in

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.060
because he said they could be dead flies.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:22.060
So were you aware of what kind of food the canteen provided?

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.060
Was it like a full kind of cooked?

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.060
I don't think there was a lot of selection, but it was cooked.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.060
I think there were probably two selections,

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.060
and there certainly wasn't a cold counter.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.060
But those were not long after the war years.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.060
So what about afternoon break? Did you have an afternoon?

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.060
Yes, we had an afternoon break.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.060
But we usually just carried on with our work

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.060
and had a cup of tea or coffee at our desk.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.060
Whereas we'd stop for ten minutes or so in the morning.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.060
And then we had an hour for lunch.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:58.060
So did you have an annual holiday allowance with pay then?

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.060
Yes, a fortnight was all.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:07.060
And you could book it in, your own time you could apply.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:11.060
You put in your holiday hours and I don't think I was ever refused.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.060
Right. Did you ever take more than that?

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.060
No, I don't think so.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.060
Was that insufficient?

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:23.060
Probably when we went to the Games I probably did.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:26.060
I must have done then, because we were there a bit longer.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.060
I should remember that, but I'm afraid I don't.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.060
You said you were paid for your holidays.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:35.060
Was that just that fortnight?

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:43.060
Yes, well I continued to pay me even though I had my holidays as well as that time for the Games.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:48.060
I didn't have to take my holiday quota to go to the Games.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.060
They gave me my holidays as well.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.060
And they paid you?

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.060
They paid me. They paid me while I was away.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.060
They were a very good company to work for I think.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:03.060
Because I did have on one occasion a problem with a man I'd met on a train and spoken to

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:09.060
and who found out where I worked and he got to be pestering and an awful nuisance.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:13.060
Our manager and our managing director got him the sack from his company.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.060
He was quite high up in the business.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.060
So they did care about their staff.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.060
This had happened out of working hours.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:26.060
It was when I was on one of my train journeys for training and a gentleman just got talking.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:31.060
The carriages were over the corridor and he'd be sat with people.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:37.060
It was a long way. I was going right up to changing trains at Manchester and going on in up to Yorkshire.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:44.060
This man just befriended me I thought and carried my case when I went to change trains.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:52.060
But in this conversation I told him where I worked and he contacted me and made a nuisance of himself.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.060
But my boss sorted it out.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:32:00.060
The director of the company sorted it out, not my immediate boss.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:04.060
So they did look after their girls.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.060
Do you think you were a kind of feather in their cap then?

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.060
I don't know.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.060
Do you think you were special?

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.060
Or would they have done that for you?

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.060
I think they'd have done it for anyone.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:20.060
I can't say. When I was in my home environment and when I was in my local environment,

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.060
I was a star because I was going to be an Olympian.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:27.060
But when I was in work I was really just one of the girls.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:31.060
So I think the treatment I received everyone would have had.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.060
They were very good employees.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.060
Except for the holidays.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:41.060
That's right. And they took me in when they weren't looking for someone to do anything.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.060
They took me in because I had a need.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.060
So they were a good company.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.060
I don't know whether BSA still exists. I'd like to know.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.060
I'll Google it.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.060
What about bank holidays? Did you have bank holidays?

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:57.060
Yes, bank holidays are off always.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:02.060
Did you ever go on holiday anywhere else except for your training?

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.060
Oh, yes. We always had holidays from a small child.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:10.060
My parents weren't well off but we'd lived the life of Rhyling.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:16.060
We had holidays in cottages in West Wales and Vye Valley.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:20.060
Sometimes we'd travel there on the back of an open-back lorry.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:25.060
But we'd get there and pitch tents or whatever.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.060
We were always at the beach.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.060
My father taught us to swim when we were very young.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:35.060
My mother could run like the wind so she used to be dashing up and down, running fast.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:40.060
I had a very happy, busy, healthy childhood.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.060
So you said your father was a very good swimmer?

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.060
Yes, he was.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:48.060
He used to swim in the Taff River a lot in those days.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:52.060
They used to have the Taff race every year.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.060
There was a man called...

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.060
I've got him in this book.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:02.060
He always won the Taff swim and he used to train for it by doing it.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:07.060
My father used to go with him and used to lead all the way but didn't have the money to enter.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:13.060
He was one of a large family that had neither father nor mother who had both died.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:17.060
He was the breadwinner from the age of 14.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:23.060
So there was never the money for him to enter the Taff race.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:28.060
He used to swim with a man called Rad Milovic.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.060
He used to win it every year.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:36.060
My father would lead him or could beat him every time but didn't have the money to enter.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.060
Very sad.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.060
What about your mother? Did your mother race?

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:49.060
She could run but there was no athletics in our area that I know of at my mother's time.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:55.060
She played baseball and she could get around those bases like a hare.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:35:01.060
She had a crippled sister who had a club foot who could bat like mad and was a very good backstop.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:08.060
When it was her sister's turn, her sister would hit the ball and my mother would run for her.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.060
But then she'd have to do her own run as well.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:13.060
She was very much that way.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:22.060
She'd had a very hard life and childhood from acute poverty.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:31.060
Before she left school, she left school at about 13, she was already scrubbing out offices.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:36.060
She had to take a walk about half an hour to get to it before school and after school.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.060
When she finished school, it was a brush factory.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:45.060
She said, this is good, I can be a factory girl instead.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:50.060
She had to do the scrubbing in the morning and the night and the factory work.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.060
She'd come up the hard way.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.060
My dad, as I say, was his father.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.060
That was his father.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:03.060
He was an engineer on the tugboats in Cardiff Dock.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.060
He dropped it on the boat with a heart attack.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:13.060
His wife had already died in the flu epidemic after the First World War.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:17.060
The youngest child was six months when she died.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:21.060
My father was the oldest boy and there were nine of them altogether.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.060
He was brought home.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.060
They knocked the door and opened the door and they carried him in feet first and laid him on the table.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.060
They walked out and left the children with the dead father.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:34.060
He was working hard right from the beginning.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:42.060
In those days, I was in a fortunate time when, if you had skills and a bit of financial help,

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:47.060
you could do it. Nowadays, you get lots of financial help and I'm pleased to see it.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:51.060
In my mother and father's day, there was no help at all.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:55.060
Their chances of doing anything in sport were nil really.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.060
Were they both from Cardiff?

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.060
Yes, both Grangetown people.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:03.060
Baseball was a big thing for women, wasn't it?

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:08.060
Oh yes, it was. My mother played for Grippley Mills, although she never worked there.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:13.060
Her sister worked there, but my mother played for her team.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.060
My mother worked in a brush factory.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.060
They played for Grippley Mills.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:25.060
That's really interesting. The whole thing about women in factories and sport is very interesting.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:36.060
So, were there any social activities in the factory that were arranged by the workers?

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.060
Not that I can recall. No, I don't think there were any.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:48.060
On the last working day before Christmas, I think a lot of them used to go to a pub for a celebration,

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:53.060
but I was never one for drinking, so I just used to wish them Merry Christmas and go home.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.060
I wasn't very good at drinking.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.060
Were you a bit younger than most of them as well?

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:03.060
Yes, I was. My parents weren't drinking.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:08.060
My mother would have a sherry at Christmas or something, but they weren't pub people.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:13.060
They did nothing against pub people. My grandfather certainly was one, my mother's father was.

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:17.060
It wasn't something that interested me.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:21.060
There were no outings. I worked with the gas board now and on Wednesday,

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:27.060
going off on the gas board, wrinkly's outing, but there were no outings in this factory now.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.060
It was just work.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:35.060
So, when did you decide to leave?

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:42.060
When I was pregnant. I got married at 19 and I had my baby at 20.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:48.060
My husband was at sea. When he went off to sea after the wedding, we didn't know I was pregnant.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:53.060
When he came back, my son was six weeks old and my husband was not very welcome.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:57.060
So, you stayed on working then until you got married?

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:02.060
Yes, I worked until I was seven and a half months pregnant.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:06.060
Then, of course, I stopped and didn't go back.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:12.060
How did your husband feel about you still working when you were married then?

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:18.060
I was fine because we were hoping to buy a house. We were both going to be saving for a house.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:24.060
It didn't work out that way for me. It was a bit of a welcome shock eventually.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:30.060
What did you do afterwards? Did you have more than one child?

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:37.060
Yes, I had two boys. I didn't go back to work until the youngest was 14.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.060
What did you do when you went back to work?

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:43.060
I became a network analyst with the Gas Board.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:48.060
It changed as time went down and I went on to computers.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:53.060
What it came down to was that you made sure that if there was a new factory going down at the end of the road,

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:57.060
the lady at the other end could still boil the kettle.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:01.060
So, they had to put in governors or extra pipe work.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:07.060
All we did was supply the engineers with all the information and they made the decisions on what to do.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:12.060
We started off with maps, pens and paper, but eventually it was all done on computers.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.060
I had three computers that could all talk to each other from different parts.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.060
North Wales, West Wales and mine could all talk to each other.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.060
Did you do that for the duration of your life?

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:27.060
Yes, until I retired. From the time my son was 14, the youngest was 14.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:34.060
Let's think now. He was born in 1958, so that was 1972.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:42.060
From 1972 until I was 58, which was now. I was born in 1948.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:49.060
Where does that take us? It's a long time.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.060
When were you born?

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.060
1934.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:57.060
1934 and 1958.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:01.060
I started working there when my son was...

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.060
So, is that 1992?

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.060
Probably.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:11.060
1992, 1958 and 34, 1992.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:16.060
So, you retired about 20 years?

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:21.060
Yes, they were dismantling the gas industry.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:25.060
Our engineering department was going to Birmingham.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:30.060
I had a chance to work there if I wanted to, but I only worked part-time anyway.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.060
I was two years off retirement. I was just less than two years off retirement.

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.060
That was when retirement was at 60.

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:42.060
I opted for redundancy and went.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:49.060
So, tell me then about the parallel universe of your sports career.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.060
Tell me what happened in Helsinki.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.060
It was amazing.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:57.060
From the training bit then, to link it to the factory.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.060
Yes, to link it to the factory.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:06.060
I had a very good coach, a man called Cecil Guy.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:11.060
He was an ex-PTI.

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:16.060
After the war, in the wartime he was a PTI in this country.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:22.060
After the war, several of them were given jobs in what used to be the ARP huts around Cardiff

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:30.060
to set up recreational activities for people who had only known the war and air raids and this sort of thing.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:36.060
He set up a bowling green. He did bowling, table tennis, football.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:41.060
He played for Cardiff City Seconds himself in his youth before the war.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:50.060
He did gymnastics as well. He used to run wist drives and things for people in this little hut.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:56.060
That's where all my gymnastics started.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.060
Where did you want me to go from here?

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.060
I'm sorry, but what does PTI mean?

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.060
A physical training instructor.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:09.060
He was an RAF PTI.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.060
When they were demobbed, some of them managed.

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:16.060
When the men came after the war, they were in jobs for all of them.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.060
He had that job. He was an absolutely brilliant coach.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:27.060
I used to do all sorts of sports, table tennis, keep fit, country dancing and girl guides.

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:31.060
I did all sorts of things and played the piano quite well actually.

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:35.060
When it came down to it in the end, I knew what I wanted to do.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:40.060
I'd found my field of expertise really. I was built for it.

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.060
I had wonderful support at home.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:51.060
I had this coach that knew very little about gymnastics before we started this club other than this sort of thing.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.060
He learned a lot and taught me a lot.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:58.060
It just progressed from there really.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.060
When did you start getting interested in gymnastics?

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:07.060
I used to do something in Ninian Park School when I was a junior.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.060
They used to run a keep fit night.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.060
Mostly it was country dance and things like that.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:16.060
They also used to do a little bit where you jumped over a box.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.060
There was no springboard or anything.

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.060
It was just a coconut mat.

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:24.060
When you landed on it, you disappeared in a cloud of dust.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.060
I started there.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:35.060
After the war, and during the war as well, they had what they called holidays at home.

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:40.060
Things would go on in the parks for people to have some entertainment.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.060
It was very well thought out actually.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:50.060
I can remember as a child we used to go and hear bands play and watch different activities going on in the park.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:55.060
On one occasion I saw this gym coach with some girls and boys.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:59.060
They were vaulting over a box and tumbling on the mat.

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.060
I thought, I'd like to try that.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:06.060
I went to ask to join and I was told that you had to be 12.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.060
I was 11.

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.060
I told him I was 12.

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:12.060
With a blatant lie, I got into the club.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.060
Then I just started from there.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.060
He must have spotted the talent.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:21.060
I still coach gymnastics now.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.060
We've got another class tonight.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.060
You can pick out.

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:32.060
Usually if they're a bit on the dwarf side, if you're a bit of a midget, you've got a better chance of being a gymnast.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:35.060
He encouraged me and he was very supportive.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.060
He did a lot of learning himself.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:43.060
He travelled a lot with me as well, which I think he'd be unlikely to do these days, a man with a little girl.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:52.060
My parents trusted him implicitly and used to come and visit my parents quite regularly to explain what was planned and what was going on.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:55.060
I think they were quite happy about that.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:59.060
That's how it really got going.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:05.060
When I got to be selected and we went over to the Games, it was so exciting.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.060
I can tell you a funny story. Would you like to hear it?

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:13.060
When we got to go on the plane, we gymnasts were all the midgets on the plane.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:19.060
One person on the plane was MacDonald Bailey, who was supposed to win the gold medal in the sprints.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.060
He didn't actually. He heard McKendie from Kenya on it.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:26.060
That's another story, but not a very savoury one.

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:31.060
They wanted to film MacDonald Bailey going up the steps and going to the plane.

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:37.060
I thought it would be interesting if they had these little girls going up at the same time, because he was like 9ft 4cm.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:42.060
He was enormous and very black. Such a gentleman.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.060
We all had to get off the plane, our team and that.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:49.060
As we were going up the steps now, we had to wave and it was Pathy News.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.060
The camera was taking it down.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:56.060
My mother was very worried because no one in our family had ever been up in an aeroplane.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.060
My mother was quite convinced we were going to crash.

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:03.060
I had to tell her. She made me promise that when I got there I would send a telegram.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:07.060
Don't spend a lot of money. Just put, arrive safely.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:13.060
I passed out on the plane. I'm a terrible traveller. That's another story.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:23.060
When I got there, I sent my mother the telegram and it said, arrive safely, see Pathy News.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.060
She must be on Pathy News.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.060
We went to the Capitol Cinema, she and my father.

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:32.060
They used to have two films then and lots of bits going on.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:36.060
My mother's backside was making bed because it was not coming on.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:42.060
Eventually, there was cock-a-doodle-doo and this thing.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:47.060
Going over to the Olympics today, there we were going up the steps.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:53.060
My mother shot up in the middle of the cinema waving at me and saying, there's Al Gwyn.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:57.060
My father was saying, sit down woman, sit down.

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:59.060
She embarrassed him no end.

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:03.060
She was so overcome by it, she had to wave back and stand up and shout out to do it.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.060
It was funny.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:10.060
When we got over there, I'm surprised we did any work at all because we'd had a lot of rationing over here.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:17.060
There, I can remember sending my mother a card saying, we're allowed two eggs.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:21.060
That was then heard of. You could actually have two eggs on your plate.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:24.060
There was no rationing and we ate ourselves silly.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:29.060
I'm surprised we managed to do any gymnastics because the food was fabulous.

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.060
We had a good time over there.

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:41.060
When we got there, we found out that all the work we'd been doing, which had been translated from the French, was incorrect translation.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:44.060
They used to do set work and voluntary work in those days.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.060
All the set work was wrong.

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.060
We had to spend our time getting it right.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:50.060
How were you selected?

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.060
We had trials.

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:58.060
They also had, in those days, the last of the games where the women did a team drill.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.060
They watched to do that as well.

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.060
Different ones would take different places and so on.

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:07.060
I was very good at dance.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:17.060
I think that helped me get into the team as well, was the fact that I was rather good at the team drill.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:21.060
Some of the girls were a bit on the stiff side, moving.

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:23.060
I top scored for the team.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.060
I wasn't the youngest in the team.

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.060
Valerie Mullins was the youngest.

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.060
She was three days younger than me and she was from Swansea.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:34.060
I top scored in the games for our team, but we didn't come anywhere.

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:39.060
How many of you from Wales went?

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:42.060
In that games, we were the majority.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:45.060
There were three from Swansea.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:49.060
Susie Davies, Valarie Marians and Margo Morgan.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:53.060
The first reserve was from Swansea too, but she didn't go.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.060
Then there was myself and Margo Thomas.

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.060
Five of us and it was a team of eight.

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:03.060
We were two from Cardiff and three from Swansea in the women's team.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.060
We were five of the eight.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.060
We did really well.

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:10.060
That was a spectacular result then, wasn't it?

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.060
Yes, it was indeed.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.060
How did the team do?

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:16.060
Badly.

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:24.060
It was mostly because when you did sets on voluntary,

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.060
the set work had been wrongly translated.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:31.060
Some of them really struggled to do the bar set the new way.

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:35.060
I was very strong and I did quite well on it.

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.060
As a team, we sent down.

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:41.060
When we got there, we found that the vault,

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.060
we'd been used to a springboard, not like they have today,

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.060
but it had a thing across and it had some spring.

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:50.060
When we got there, it was what we would have called a beat board,

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.060
which was just a board and then planks going down and it was solid.

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:56.060
You could jump on it, but there was absolutely no spring at all.

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:59.060
Nobody could get over on this hand spring vault.

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:02.060
You had to get to full handstand and spring off it.

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.060
That was the set vault because we had more complicated voluntary vaults on that.

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.060
Most of the girls couldn't get up.

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.060
In those days, they used to vault with the board in quite close.

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:13.060
I thought, if we moved the board back and ran a bit further,

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:16.060
perhaps we could dive and get up there.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:20.060
Myself and another girl from our team managed to get up and do it.

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:24.060
They used to train in gyms then.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:29.060
A country would have an hour or two hours, I can't remember the amount of time,

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:31.060
followed by another and another.

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:34.060
Following us on one occasion was the Russian team.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.060
They had a glass door.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.060
They were waiting outside, looking through the glass door.

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:43.060
He came in and asked whether he could film me doing this vault.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.060
They had this sort of cine camera.

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.060
I've still got one upstairs.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:49.060
He had that sort of cine camera.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.060
He took films of me doing it.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:56.060
Anyway, we didn't see them working all the time.

00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:00.060
When it came to the finals day, they had the final stop on each apparatus.

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.060
We got there early so we could get a front seat.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:08.060
The front seat was right on the floor, not as it would be now.

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:13.060
One of the Russian girls won and her vault was very poor.

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.060
She got the medal.

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:18.060
He brought her over to me, seeing me sitting in the front.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:21.060
He took the medal off her and hung it around my neck.

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:25.060
He shook his head and took it back and put it on her and went.

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:28.060
He knew she shouldn't have won it.

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:35.060
What they did in those days, if they didn't want you to win,

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.060
they wouldn't knock you off a bit.

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:42.060
They'd knock you off a lot and claim that it must have been a dreadful mistake in there.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:46.060
I don't think I was even topscorer for vault 14.

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:49.060
I can't remember.

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:51.060
But still an amazing experience.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.060
Amazing. Amazing people from all countries.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.060
We watched the men's as well.

00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:01.060
The Indian men took their turbans off and their hair was up in the top,

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:04.060
all tied with a great floppy white bow.

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:07.060
As they were working, it would be coming and done by the yard.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:09.060
So little things like that.

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:14.060
The Japanese men, they marched past because we always got there early and sat in the front.

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:18.060
As they marched on, they left a waft of perfume behind.

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:23.060
In those days, men didn't wear aftershave in the things, but the Japs did.

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:28.060
We used to watch them go, oh, they smelt lovely, but we thought it was a bit sissy.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:32.060
There were lots of things like that.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:37.060
Quite a different world to anything we've lived in.

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:42.060
I just wanted to ask you about any other games.

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:45.060
Olympics and Commonwealth and whatever.

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.060
Commonwealth games.

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:51.060
Gymnastics only came into the Commonwealth Games after I retired.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:55.060
Oh, really? So no gymnastics in Cardiff in 1958?

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.060
No, my husband was in it, but he was in it as a highboard diver.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.060
There wasn't any.

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:09.060
For the Olympics, they didn't send a women's team to Australia in 1956.

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:13.060
They had three trials. I won all three trials.

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:17.060
But it was decided that because I was at that time a mother,

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:21.060
it was not right for me to be taken away from my child, so I was denied the chance to go.

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.060
They decided that?

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:25.060
They decided that.

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.060
We still lived in a big house, in part of a big house that my mother was in,

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:32.060
and my children had two mothers. They wouldn't have missed me.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:36.060
Anyway, we didn't go. That was one child there.

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:42.060
Then in 1960, I captained a team that went to Rome and topscored there for Britain,

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:45.060
but we didn't come anywhere.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:50.060
So I did go again, but I've done loads since,

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:55.060
because I've travelled a lot with British teams to world championships,

00:54:55.060 --> 00:55:00.060
not to Olympics, but to world championships, European championships and internationals.

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:05.060
There's not a country in Europe I haven't been to, so I've had some wonderful experiences.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:08.060
The sport's been very good to me. Very good.

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:11.060
Will you be going to the Commonwealth Games this year?

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:13.060
No, it's in Glasgow, but I won't be going.

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:17.060
I don't work high level anymore. I'm interested to watch it, you know.

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:25.060
At the gym club I'm running now, we used to have the main hall in the Pier Pavilion,

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:30.060
and when money was raised to do up the building, which was desperately needed,

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:35.060
we were promised by the council that we could have a church on the top of the hill, which was derelict,

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:39.060
and there was money given to them by a building company to do it up for us,

00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:45.060
but they reneged on that. They're now going to sell it off for flats, which is typical of our council, I'm afraid.

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:51.060
So we now rent a factory unit just on the outskirts of Bury, although we're pin-hauled the gymnastics club,

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:58.060
and we've got lots of members there, and as long as we can pay the rent, which is £25,000 a year,

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.060
we'll keep going.

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:07.060
We're the only ones that deal with special needs in the area, so the youngsters come to us, you know.

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:12.060
So tell me, when did you retire as a gymnast?

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:14.060
In 1961.

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:18.060
Right, and when did you become a coach?

00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:24.060
I was already coaching before I retired, but I didn't qualify as a coach until later,

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:28.060
and I eventually got to an international coaching standard.

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.060
Right.

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:35.060
So, you know, it sort of goes to the system club, club, area, national, and so on, when I got to international standard.

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:37.060
So I travelled a lot with British teams.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.060
Right, and you were coaching at the top level then?

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.060
Yes.

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.060
Yes.

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.060
So I had a girl that was in the Olympics.

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.060
Right.

00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:51.060
Pamela Hopkins she was, Pamela Hardwick she is now, and two girls that have been in the Commonwealth Games in the past.

00:56:51.060 --> 00:57:02.060
But to be honest, I don't aim for the dizzy heights anymore because I don't approve of the training programmes for small children that there are.

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:11.060
I don't approve them losing school to train, and I see too many young children retire with overuse injuries.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:14.060
Children, not adults, children.

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:21.060
And so to get to the standard that you have to get to, you've got to give up a lot and take a lot of risk.

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:26.060
And I'm not prepared for my children to, I call on my children to do that.

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:34.060
If they've got the talent and want that, I'm quite happy to help them move on to someone who will, but I won't be part of it.

00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:40.060
I'm an old fashioned biddy, and I don't like the way it goes.

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:46.060
Yes, we've seen that with some people in the Olympics, and tennis and things.

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:47.060
Yes, yes.

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:50.060
Now haven't we, in the last 20 years.

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:52.060
I mean, we've got children now.

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:58.060
When I started gymnastics, my coach didn't take anyone until they were 12, and I wasn't even 12.

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:02.060
But now they're retiring at nine.

00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:04.060
I mean, this is appalling.

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:08.060
I shouldn't say this about my own sport, but it is my hobby.

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:12.060
It's one thing I feel very strongly about, very, very strongly.

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:16.060
Tell me about your work now with disabled people.

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:22.060
Well, I designed a programme of work for children with, for school children with disabilities, for schools to take part in.

00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:27.060
And I managed to get some sponsorship from Rotary, who fund most of it.

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:31.060
It's still going now, although I haven't been involved with it myself now for four years.

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:40.060
I ran it since, oh, I said 30 odd years I did it, on my kitchen table, until I got to 800 taking part in a year.

00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:45.060
So it goes on through schools all throughout Wales.

00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:55.060
It's a gradual programme, a progressive programme of work, so that the vault, for instance,

00:58:55.060 --> 00:59:02.060
stand on a very small thing and jump off, and that's the vault, until the higher levels actually go over a low box.

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:06.060
So it goes through four ranges of work.

00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:09.060
And that still continues.

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:14.060
I was offered a marvellous job in Germany working there.

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:20.060
They offered me a fabulous wage and a flat on it, and a Mercedes, and I didn't want to go to Germany.

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:28.060
And Saudi Arabia used it, because they saw a display of some of this work and asked me to make a copy of the programme,

00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:30.060
and I understand they're using it in their schools.

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.060
So I'm quite proud of that.

00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:39.060
My latest reason to feel proud is that three of my gymnasts,

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:47.060
two with Down syndrome and one autistic, severely autistic, have just gained their coaching awards.

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:49.060
They're qualified as assistant coaches.

00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:53.060
They'll never be class responsible, but they've got the dignity of being one.

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:59.060
And they take, on a Thursday we have a beginner's special needs class, and then the advanced ones after,

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:03.060
or the older, sometimes they're not so advanced, they're just getting a bit older.

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:05.060
And they conduct the whole of that class.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.060
They run it under supervision, of course.

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.060
We're always there, myself and a couple of others.

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:13.060
But we can just sit and chat, because they just do it brilliantly.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:16.060
And they've got their coaching awards, so I'm really proud of that.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:25.060
We already had one Down syndrome boy that had got a coaching award, but he was sort of exceptional.

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:29.060
He still coaches with us now, and he's 38.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.060
He coaches mainstream.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.060
The other three now coach disabled themselves.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.060
So that's nice.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:42.060
And we've always got someone in the British Special Olympics team, wherever it is.

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:46.060
We've always got someone and they always win. They do really well.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:54.060
I think, I feel that the people think this is wonderful things for the special people with disabilities.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.060
We've got physical and learning disabilities.

01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:02.060
But to me, the ones who benefit the most are the mainstream children, because they train together.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:07.060
And they get so used to them being there that they're never going to stop in the street,

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:11.060
and their children will never stop in the street and stare at someone who doesn't look quite the same.

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.060
And all our social events are together.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:18.060
We have Christmas parties, we have discos, we have outings, and they're all together.

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:23.060
And it's not unusual for somebody about six years old to come up and say,

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:28.060
Gareth's round the corner and he's crying, and Gareth's 32.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:32.060
So they never get told anything. They just accept what there is.

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.060
They accept them for what they are.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.060
We don't give lessons in how to deal with them.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:40.060
They just treat them as part of the class, and they get to work it out for themselves.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:47.060
And I think, for all the work we've done in getting some of the special needs to quite high level of performance,

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:52.060
I think the greatest achievement we have is the acceptance of the mainstreamers with them.

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.060
So I'm proud of that.

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:57.060
Can I just ask you one more thing?

01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:01.060
Why did you get interested in disability school?

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.060
Well, there was not a choice.

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:06.060
We had a running gym club. We used to work in Stanwell School at the time,

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:11.060
when they had a big funding grant to modernise it, it threw us out.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:19.060
But when we were there, I was asked to go to the YMCA in Cardiff,

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:24.060
which was in the parade, to see some of the gymnasts working.

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:28.060
I was quite impressed, although I felt they were treating them like disabled

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.060
and they'd like to be treated like proper people, you know.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.060
Anyway, that's just a personal thing.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:37.060
But then the girl, it was a man and a husband and wife, and the girl got pregnant.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:42.060
So they asked us whether we would take them over, take their class over,

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:46.060
for a little while, until after she'd had the baby.

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:50.060
So I said, would I take it over? And I said, no, I can't.

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:55.060
Because I lived in Grangetown and I was training in Penarth, coaching in Penarth,

01:02:55.060 --> 01:03:00.060
and they wanted me, and I said, if they can come over to us, we'll put on a special,

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:05.060
we'll move a class back and bring them in in front, and they can come over if they'll be happy with that.

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:11.060
So that was fine. So over they came, and the biggest problem we had was behavioural.

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:14.060
And I thought, well, I'm not putting up with this.

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:18.060
So we got them to tow the party line in no time at all,

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:21.060
and once they did, they had a much better time. They enjoyed it more.

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:25.060
And we had about, I said to the parents, we'll take them for a month,

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:30.060
then we'll have a little discussion about whether you want us to keep them until Angela's had this baby.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:35.060
And so the parents came in and they said, and I overstepped the mark actually,

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:40.060
because I said, well, one thing we can do is we can make them all socially acceptable.

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:46.060
What I'd received was not socially acceptable, and there was no reason why some of these should behave the way they are,

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.060
and they were always going to be, I felt, outcasts.

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:54.060
So some of the parents were a bit shocked at me saying that, but I really felt that that's what we had to offer.

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:58.060
And anyway, they said, yes, they'd like them to stay.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:03.060
But Angela and her husband never came back, so we just carried on having them,

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:07.060
and we got so involved with them, we shouldn't be without having them like that.

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:13.060
But it wasn't a deliberate thing, it was quite an accident that we took them apart.

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:17.060
Just to ask you one more thing about the factory.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:22.060
Looking back now, how do you feel about the time you spent working in the factory?

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:27.060
I loved it. Yes, they made me very welcome when I first got there.

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:33.060
I was a very young teenager, I think we were younger in those days,

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:36.060
and they were all adults that I was working with,

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:42.060
so I did feel a bit strange when I first went there, because where there was a lot of girls, they weren't there.

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:51.060
But they were happy days, they were very kind to me, they were appreciative of the work I did.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:58.060
I felt that the men in the factory treated me nicely, it was good, I enjoyed it.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:07.060
I only left because I had a baby, and in those days, at least I was of the opinion that if you had a baby you became a man.

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:09.060
That was your first priority.

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.060
Can I just ask you about Grangetown as well?

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:15.060
Was there an athletic club?

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:19.060
No, it was an ARP hut.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:28.060
There was one by Ninian Park School, and there was one down on what they called the Marl, which was down Ferry Road.

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.060
Wasn't there something called the Grange Ladies?

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:36.060
Grange Ladies Gymnastic Club was what I was part of. That's what I belonged to.

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:42.060
So that's what I wanted to ask you about. When did that start?

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:46.060
That was the display that I saw in the park.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:52.060
They were Grange Ladies. They also ran a boys' team as well.

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:56.060
They had more girls than boys, but the boys mostly did the football.

01:05:56.060 --> 01:06:00.060
That was how I came to join because I'd seen them in the park.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:03.060
This will be the school again.
