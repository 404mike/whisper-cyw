00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.740
Thank you so much for your very kind words. My warmest greetings to the people

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.480
of my beloved Wales and a special hello to the miners of South Wales at this

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.480
great festival. It is a great privilege to be participating in this historic

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.660
festival and all the best to you as we strive toward a world where we all can

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:41.160
live abundant, peaceful and dignified lives. I'm going to begin with one of my

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.600
own songs, Didn't My Lord Deliver Daniel, bringing freedom to our people, another

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.960
one of my people, this little light of mine, and all through the night in a

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.840
Beethoven melody and a Schubert melody. I shall be singing to you and I have a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.000
very distinguished American pianist, colleague of mine, also an American

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.760
Negro at the piano, Mr. Alan Booth. One day we may see you in Wales.
