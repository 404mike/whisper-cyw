00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
The other thing I remember, when you have the Passover, you only eat leavened bread, the matzo.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:16.940
Not only do you only eat leavened bread, but all the crockery and the cutlery and the food that you eat has to be leaven-free.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.600
Now you could say, well, how is a plate, you know, leaven-free?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.540
What you do is you have separate plates, you have separate cups, you have separate sauces, everything.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.640
And you put the stuff for the rest of the year in the cupboard and you take this stuff out and you have that for the eight days of Passover.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.580
Why am I telling you this? Because even the milk had to be the right kind of milk for Passover.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:50.180
So we used to take a tin can, go down to the farm at the bottom of the road, and we used to milk the cow straight into the can.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.080
It was to take it home and that's what we drank, that kind of milk.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.720
We couldn't get it from the milkman because it wasn't kosher enough.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.720
It's amazing, we were like, King back.
