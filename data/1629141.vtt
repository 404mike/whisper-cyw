00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
Before I got Sulaire, I'd been taking Bob Morris, Dr. Bob Morris out in the Anna Lloyd,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.720
in the Linda Lloyd, in the Linda Lloyd.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.680
He came along to do some research and he implored, he chartered me in the Linda Lloyd to do this,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.240
take him out, putting hydrophones out there and stuff.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.920
Which is amazing because he was funded by the Admiralty, he was paying me Â£150 a day

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.480
and in those days I had a lot of money.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.640
I was like, wow, really?

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.640
So that was really cool.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.480
Did work with him, got the Sulaire.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.880
So there's a tension growing on the dolphins.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.520
It was the first of the bit of attention coming with Bob Morris.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.880
I think Greenpeace had probably swung in there with their boat by then.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.320
I've got a newspaper cut out that could get the date exactly when they came in.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.640
They came in with Rainbow Warriors saying, oh, there's only eight dolphins left in Cardigan Bay.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.400
And, you know, it's a...

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.840
I mean, we had a big meeting in New Wellington.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.960
And I represented, for some reason I was representing, not Newquay, but us, the general boating public.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.760
And I remember telling them, saying, what do you think you're doing?

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.560
You're raising the profile of these animals.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.000
We're going to have every man and his dog now coming down and chasing the dolphins.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.320
And just what's happened, chasing the dolphins and looking at them.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.960
And they would say, well, it's a double-edged sword, Steve was their answer.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.400
You've got to raise the profile to protect them.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.160
But protection hasn't sort of come in the quantity that the sort of profile's been raised, if you get what I mean.
