00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
When you were in school, did you get any information or teaching about relationships or sex and things like that?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.800
We did have...

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.320
It was more in high school

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.080
that we had... it wasn't much of a sex talk.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.920
It was just how to keep safe.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720
Erm...

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.240
And...

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.760
That's about it.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.600
And how have you sort of learnt since then about relationships and sex and things like that?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600
I'm more aware of it now.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.480
And I know when having sex...

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Erm...

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Is to be safe.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.240
Because there can be some things that can happen.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.080
Unexpectedly.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.080
And sometimes that can't...

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.480
It can't be cured.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.360
So I'm now very, very aware.
