00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You tell me your name and where were you originally born?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
My name is Rukhsana Raza.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I was born in Pakistan.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You want a city as well?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well we can go into that. So tell me what memories do you have of where you were born?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What was it like? What kind of people lived there? How was it like growing up there?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Of me.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And tell me about the city. Where was it? This area, the city?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Were you born in a city or village?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
No city.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So tell me about the city. What was it like? What do you remember?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It was Karachi. The city of Karachi in Pakistan.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
My father was in Pakistan army.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So we didn't live in one place.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Always they have transfers to some cities in Pakistan.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And we've been to so many cities there.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So I can't say, but after my dad's death, it's a long time, I was very young.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So we were in Karachi.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
All the relatives were in Karachi.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I grew up there. I can say because I was ten when my dad died.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So I grew up in Karachi.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What was Karachi like?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's a big city.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And what was it like?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What do you remember of it? Can you tell me the smells? What did you see? What did it feel like?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We have relatives.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
My mom's side, my granddad and my aunties all lived there.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
My dad had a house.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
My dad bought a house in Karachi at the very beginning.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Because my family and his family was there.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So he was a very clever person, my dad.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And we were soon, my dad died.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
He died in Bangladesh.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
He went there.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
He was posted over there.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And he died there after heart attack.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So we came back here, Karachi.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Just going to check this is definitely recording.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So, okay, tell me about, the next question is...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So yes, I grew up there. I educated and married there and then came here.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So when did you leave Karachi?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
1980, for my marriage and just after I came here.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And how old were you when you arrived here?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I was twenty-six.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And do you remember?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I married and came here, yes.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
What was your first week like when you arrived here in the UK?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Very strange. Everything was different.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:51.000
First thing, I was scared with these glasses, doors with glasses.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I asked my husband, if someone break in, whatever.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
He says, no.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I always scared with windows.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
If someone break in, he says, no, no one do this.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Then gradually he take me out and the shop, all type of shopping.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
What was your first best experience here in the UK?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Maybe what was some of your not so good?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So one good, one not so good in the UK.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Can you, your earliest can you remember?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I've been very fortunate, I say.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:48.000
My husband was, he had a shop in the town in here.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And he goes there and buy a sales shop here.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:06.000
He had, and he take me over there and he had another business in the beach.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
What is it called?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
It's called Breen and Barrow.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So he took all activities.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
He gave tender and took all, he do all activities there.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Horse riding and selling ice cream and other things to eat people.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
These things.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So I do go there just three months later in summer because I came here in March.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So I, it was very good for me.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
It was nice experience.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Just I came three months after I started work there with my husband.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
It was lots of work, cars, parking.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
It was very different, it's 42 years now.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And very different cars comes and we give them ticket, parking ticket.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And my husband give tender to other people for horse riding and selling snacks and things.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So sometimes if no one is there, I do go there, sell things in a caravan.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It was very nice experience.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And we lived there all summer for three months.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Yes, at least three months in a camp.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So it was again nice experience.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So I know you've already said it, but the card run out when you were talking.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And the question was, you moved to Cooperation Road.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Tell me about what life was like when you moved there.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Yeah, there were not many people who were here.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And Cooperation Road was as it is.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
No, there are new houses.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
They are by the river.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
It was a big yard.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Used to be a train track cross over the Cooperation Road.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I didn't see it was finished, I think, when I came.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Then they broke and made houses over there.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Now they are full.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's a long time, I think, seven, eight years now.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And they develop that place.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Here, mostly I've seen most of the shops are same.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
One fish and chips shop and one is just where we live.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:29.000
One fish and chips shop just changed from the owner just four or five years ago.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And most all same children, not anyone is doing their job.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Since last few years, few years, 20 years, before that it was very little population here.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Now it is very much.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It looks too many people everywhere.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
When we go for shopping, when we go anywhere outside house.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
At that time, not many people were here.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000
In this time, since I came here, so many people from other countries came here.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And this city became, this was town at that time called town, Newport town.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So it is quite crowded now.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And I can see because it is crowded in the beginning, everything we feel is good.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I think with me, no one was for me that you are not English, you are Pakistani or like this.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
No one said this thing.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Just one lady was there.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
She used to talk to me.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
She was in front of our house because I was alone.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.000
She came out and because she lives in old people's house, I used to talk with her.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Once, just once she said, oh you Pakistani people eat pancake and smelly food.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I don't like this.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
She said this one.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
She talked to me nicely.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:56.000
But she said what was in her mind.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Everything was smoothly good.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:17.000
But when my sons educated here and born and brought up, my one son did MBA.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
He wanted a job here.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
He did try a lot as people, children do.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Once he went for interview, they called him.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
First he went to the Redding.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
He stayed there for two days.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So we made him to stay over there in a hotel.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
He passed there.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Then the second interview was in Birmingham.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
He went to Birmingham.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
He stayed there one night or two nights.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I forgot.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Six or seven years.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So their second stage, it was second stage of interview.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
He was very good.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:24.000
They said after second stage, they said no you are not good for our company or what was it.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
He was very depressed.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
He said I was very good in everything.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
That's why they called me the other interview.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Few British boys were as well there.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So they made me behind.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
He said no, no, it's not a job for you.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
You can go home.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So he was very depressed.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Very, very depressed because he went for two place for that interview.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Before that he wasn't successful in first interviews.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
But in this he was very, he said they did me.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
They backed me from there.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So he decided other son helped me.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
He was okay.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So as you are going through, I'm sure I can't place this now.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I'm fortunate because of my husband.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
He worked here.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:09.000
He did work for this country quite a lot because he worked in a big publishing company.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
In the beginning when he came here.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So he contributed a lot for this country.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
He was in Bristol then he came here.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000
So what part of your culture do you like to maintain as you live here now?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Do any celebrations, practices, traditions you maintain?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Yes, there are.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.000
In the beginning I did not know when not many people were there or were here in few years.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Not many because the other people who were here from Pakistan, they were different culture.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
The language I speak, Urdu, they don't speak Urdu.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So we couldn't mix.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
We can't mix them because our culture everything was there.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I grew up in a big city and my dad was in army and different backgrounds.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
So we don't know Punjabi or Bengali or anything.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I didn't know about Bengali.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
They were not much here.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
From Pakistan they were quite a lot of operational.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
So two, three years we did not know.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I can't celebrate.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Only my husband and his brother was here.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
They both came together.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
We celebrate, go to each other's house.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Probably it happened.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Then there were so many relatives and so many nice friends here.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Before this all I...

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Do you have any brothers and sisters?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
One is here, other in Pakistan.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
What memories do you have of your brothers and sisters?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
It's very good.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
It's very helpful to each other.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
We love each other.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Yes, we love each other.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
We want to help whenever anyone wants help.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
All the experiences.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
How long have you been involved, Age Alive?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I started before the pandemic.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
About two years or three years before the pandemic.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And a year after my husband is quite ill.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
He needs all the time there.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I can't leave him.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
After one year I left.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Age Alive.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And then pandemic.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Then my husband died two years ago.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
After that I started again.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Someone forces me to come.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Yasmin is very good.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
She always force and message me,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
come and join, why you are alone at home.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Why you are becoming...

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Why you are thinking you are alone.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Why don't you start again here?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
So after she pursued me and I started again.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Yes, I enjoy.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
All my other old friends are here.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Used to be that those days.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And the other new one.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
We are all friends here.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Know each other's background mostly.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And go outside.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Day trips from here.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Enjoy it.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000
It made since I came here my depression came out slowly.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Otherwise I was very depressed.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
After my husband passed away.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
And now yes I am.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
We are all...

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Talk from any nation or any background.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
We are all friends here.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
We speak to each other.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Talk.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
It's good.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
It's very good.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
It's good.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
You just answered all those questions really.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
If someone from your family was to see this video in 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
50 years from today.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
What message would you like to give them?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Let's say 100 years from today.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Because this is where it's going on.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
It's going on in people's collection.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
And that's what the exhibition is about.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
We maintain stories.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
We tell people that we are here.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Doing things.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
They arrive from we don't know where.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Ethnetic.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Age and lives group is for ethnic minority groups.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
As a piece of legacy that you would like to pass on a message.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
A nice message.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
What type of message?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Maybe your great great great grandchildren.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
What would you say to them?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
I can't see.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
What type of message I give them.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
I can see my stay in here.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
I am fortunate.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Very fortunate.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
It was very good.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
With every place.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
My house, my husband, my house, my other things.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I went to the school and learned some teaching.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
And did few years.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And then after that.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
If you educate good.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And good to everyone.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
You will success.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
You will achieve everything.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Speak everyone nicely and be friend.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
So no one will be your enemy.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
This is my experience.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
If someone talk to me badly.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I don't talk badly.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
I speak nicely.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And next time if he don't want to speak.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I start speaking.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
So this is my message for my generation.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
So those people think.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And say now to me.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
You are very good.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
We are sorry.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
We were not good at that time.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
And we were angry.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And we know you are very good.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
They say so I am proud.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Of my this behaviour.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
With everyone.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
A July is for members over 50.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
If there is somebody over 50 in Newport.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
That doesn't know a July.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
What message would you give them?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
I can say to join it.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
It's very good.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
All members are very friendly.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
And we go out.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Go out for anything.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Shopping trips.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Parts.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Day out.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And museums.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
And parties.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Go outside.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
In any restaurant.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
All together.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
It's very fun here.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
We enjoy everything.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Is there anything else you would like to say?
