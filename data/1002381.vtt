I'd like to welcome all of you to our St. David's Day program, and I hope you enjoy it as much as you have in the past.

The Seattle Welsh Women's Club was organized in 1928 by Lillian Ostrom.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And she put an ad in the old Seattle Star paper. We used to have four daily papers in the city of Seattle.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We only have the two now. But she had put an ad in the paper asking women who were interested in the Welsh Club to meet with her at the YWCA.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And they met, and that was the start of the Welsh Women's Club.
