00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So is it still a working farm?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Oh yeah, very much so, yes.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Lots of sheep being tail shorn at the moment.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Oh really?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
No, Ev keeps the sheep very well.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And yeah, still a very active farm.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And he came back from his travels and he's been working on the farm ever since,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and making as best he can.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I mean farming is very difficult for all farmers,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and these times aren't any better than any other I think at the moment,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with all the uncertainties that exist with both Brexit and foreign markets really.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So is it just sheep?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Just a sheep farm.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It used to be mainly sheep, but Diana's uncle who farmed it before they moved there,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
he had cattle as well.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And there are many tales to tell about Uncle Jack who was the oldest son and Randevanne.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And one of the fondest, I never met him, he died before I came on the scene here,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but one of the fondest memories that people like Daitl and Arnall or Bernie,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
who's also a cousin to Diana, down the road,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
they will tell these tales of how he had a bull, a really big bull,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and the bull used to be put to cows locally,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but the bull got so big because he fed him so much,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
they had to demolish the barn to get him out.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And apparently Jack was a big bull of a man as well,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so they took after his owner.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Brilliant. So how many acres is Divana?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's about 250 I think.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So there's the Divana house, which is listed you say?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Yes, that's the Grey Two Star listed building, a very important building in Wales.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I've never seen it, I must go up and have a look from the outside.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And then, sorry, excuse me, your barn that you live in?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Yeah, just at the back, which was a building which was, well it was a pole barn,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and then it was called a French barn and put up in the 1960s,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
built of larch that they felled on the farm itself.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And how long has Divana been in that family?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Oh, they've had it 200 years.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Yeah, they've had it 200 years. The house itself was built around 1650.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
They can't be precise about that, but we think it's about 350 or more years old now,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
370 years old now, time goes on.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And substantially the same house inside.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's got a lot of its own same form. Some of the original windows are still there.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Some of the original doors, they've protected them with porches now,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
but the doors are still there, the heavy braced doors.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And of course the upstairs courtroom, which is where they have a little court leet there.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So was it built as a farmhouse or was it built for the...?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
No, it was a hunting lodge.
