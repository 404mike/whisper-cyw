00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600
Thursday the 8th of June, present are Mike Nicholson, Sue Nicholson and today we are

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.760
interviewing Kelly Young. Hello Kelly, how are you?

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.040
Fine. Okay, so Kelly you're a member of Chepster Mencap.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.480
Yeah. You've been coming here for many years.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.960
Yeah. Would you like to tell us a little bit about

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.840
yourself to begin with? I just like coming here to see you all of

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.320
all the people that you've got. Is that at Chepster Mencap?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.240
Yeah. Okay, so do you know roughly how long you've

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.320
been coming to Chepster Mencap? I'm not sure because it was at the old centre.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.720
I think my mum found out from Wendy Perry I think or somebody and I got there and I

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.800
didn't know where I was and I was a bit nervous but now I'm used to it now. So I like to go

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.480
on trips and go places and go for a walk and stuff.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.200
I've worked with you for over 10 years so you've got to be there, 10 at least.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.600
Yeah. And I think you've been there at least probably

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.800
20 I'd imagine but we can find that out. Yeah, something like that, I'm not sure.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.600
So what did you do before you came to the board school?

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.000
I'd just been around the shops and see my friend. I've got a mate who lives just around

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.040
the old Sunbridge Club, my mate Barry, I go and see my mate Barry and I've got another

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.040
friend called Gwyn and I go and see him, go shopping and then go and see his mum sometimes.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.760
Yeah, so what did life look like for you before Chepster Mencap?

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:46.440
I just got really bored because I had nothing else to do. I just wanted to be with friends

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.480
and meet like you and your mum and Sarah and all that.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.040
Yeah, that's nice. So it gave you some purpose to fill your days with.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.760
Because I like to go out on the buses like we did last time with John Lewis and Alan

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.560
and I like to go out on the Monday night group but we don't do that anymore.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.280
No, we do most of our evening works on a Thursday night.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.360
Yeah and I like to work with you making cakes.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.760
You have done that a couple of times with me haven't you?

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.000
Yeah. What did we bake last time?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.320
I can't remember. I think it was cookies we did last time.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.560
Yeah, I think it was cookies and I like to make something with you one day Mike again.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.240
Okay, if you enjoyed that we can do another cooking session.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.240
Yeah.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.520
So you said, going back, before you joined Chepster Mencap you said you were quite bored,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.320
you were just hanging around the shops type thing you said, occasionally going to the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.320
pub.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.320
Yeah.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.720
So Chepster Mencap has been a positive thing for you then.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.720
Yeah.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.360
Do you want to discuss some things that you like doing with them?

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.880
I just like to go out in places and like with you lot and going out to a garden centre with

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.880
Richard.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.880
Yeah.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.520
Like we did last time, went out for a drink at the garden centre and I bought Richard

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.520
a drink.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520
Did you?

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.520
Yeah.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520
You're very generous aren't you?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.520
Yeah, I bought him a drink.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.520
Nice.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.480
So thinking back over the years, what have been some of your favourite memories with Chepster

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.480
Mencap?

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.600
I like to be with the old staff and you lots well.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.600
Yeah.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.160
I used to see him and Marsh and John Lewis and all them lot.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.480
Yeah, sadly they don't work here anymore.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.200
No, but I do see John Lewis sometimes and he waves at me.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200
You still see him out and about?

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.200
Yeah.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200
That's nice.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
Yeah.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.840
And I used to wind him up like, I used to say John I got you tomorrow.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.440
He's like, oh not you.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.800
And he used to say it to me on the bus, get off my bus and walk home.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.800
And I'm like John shut up.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And he used to say get off my bus, you can walk home.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
He used to wind me up and Richard.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So you had good banter with him didn't you?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Yeah.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Nice.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Yeah.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Do you go anywhere else apart from Ken to the board store?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Monday, sometimes I go to my dad's to look after my dad's dog.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
My dad's got a police dog, a big sensation called Skye.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.200
But my mum's a bit worried me going in there in case she attacks me or bites me.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200
But she never does that, she loves me to pieces.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.000
So I go and see her and I go call her and she comes up and she sniffes me and then she

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.200
makes this, she runs around me like I know what.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:35.200
So I go and see her and then go and have her some nights, not overnight but have her in

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.200
the day.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.400
And then I go and see my dad and obviously my friends and whatever.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.400
Do you actually work at Pile Shop?

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.400
Yeah, only on a Tuesday at one o'clock, police at 3.30.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.400
And how do you feel about working at the shop?

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.400
I like it, I like being there all day helping Elaine because Elaine makes me laugh.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.400
Where she trips over and falls over and I do the chills and everything and then Sat

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.600
starts beating her up.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.600
Oh does he?

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600
Yeah, playing.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.600
That's her son isn't it?

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.600
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.600
So it is only playing.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.600
Yeah, playing he does.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.600
So what do you do at the shop?

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.600
I do steaming, tagging, pricing and serving.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.600
Do you like the serving?

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.600
Yeah.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.600
What does that do for you?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.600
I help Elaine and then she tells me how much it is or I look at the price and work it out.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.800
And I put it in and sometimes I make a mistake putting the wrong one and Elaine has to sort

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.800
it all out and get it back to right.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800
That's good then.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.800
Do you like the customers?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.800
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.800
What other things do you do with Chepstam Incap?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.800
Tuesday I come in here, up here with Annie.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.800
I was here this Tuesday making teas and cakes for everybody.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I feel like you can come in and sit down and I like doing that because it's fun and I like

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
making a cup of teas and there's some people in there who know me and they're like, I can't

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
love you and I know some of them, I do, not all of them.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And then I go home and do whatever and then sometimes on a Wednesday, like this Wednesday,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I worked at the community centre with Annie making teas and cakes and doing soups and

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
giving it out to them.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So the two things on a Tuesday is the pop-up cafe?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Yeah, and then Wednesday at the community centre.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
The community centre and that is, where's that to?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
In Bulwark.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
In Bulwark, yeah?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Yeah, by the two, by the Bound Barn.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And that's actually where you live, it's Bulwark, so you're meeting people from your area aren't you?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Yeah.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So you seem to have got quite a few jobs, you're basically working then whilst you're

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
at Chepstow Men's Cup?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Yeah.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Serving in the shops, serving teas and coffees, baking cakes, cooking lunch for people.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Yeah.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So did you ever have a job before Chepstow Men's Cup?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
No, no.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Did you ever try to get one?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I did work in Tesco's, it was only for the tree, but I used to like helping, packing

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
people's bags and everything.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And I used to work in the other child's shop in town, but I didn't like it because it wasn't

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
fun, it was just like, do you know what I mean, it wasn't that.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And that's why I like working with you a lot, because you make me laugh and giggle and...

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We do have good fun don't we?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So we work hard, but play hard as well.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Yeah.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Yeah.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Okay, so what do you get from working?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
How does it make you feel when you've finished a day's work?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I go home and I tell my mum every day what I do and she's like, have you been out today

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
or what you've been doing?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And I'll say I've been out with Mike or cooking with Mike or going shopping or doing whatever

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and mum's really happy.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Yeah.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Mummy likes it, mummy likes me being here.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So mum's proud of you?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Yeah.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Do you feel proud of yourself?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Yeah.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Mummy likes me proud in here to be with you a lot.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I think it's a great thing because it gives you the social aspects, you're seeing your

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
friends and you're meeting the community.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Yeah.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
But also you're doing a rewarding job.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And I make a cup of teas and offer everybody as well.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
You're very kind, you always offer me a drink every time I see you.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Yeah, but you always say no.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Because I'm not a tea drinker, am I?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
No.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I drink too many of these.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Yeah.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Too many fizzy drinks unfortunately.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Yeah.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So okay, so we spoke about how you do a lot of working with Chepstom NCAP.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Yeah.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
What about the social side of things?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So what do you get from seeing your friends here?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
What do you mean?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I don't get what you mean.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So working, you're obviously doing lots of tasks and you're working to help these functions

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
happen.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But when you're not working, you're normally doing something fun.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
What do you do with us that isn't working?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I don't know, I don't get what it means, mum.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
No, I know, I'm trying to articulate.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So today for instance, when we walked into this room, you were saying that you've had

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
a lovely morning.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Yeah.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And what were you doing today?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Me, I was drawing some pictures.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
You were drawing some pictures?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And I drew a picture of me and Keely, our withers.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Right.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And what is the picture going to be used for?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I'm not sure, it's in the envelope, I don't know.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Mike's put it in an envelope, I don't know what it is.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Yeah, I explained it, but I'll explain it again.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It's the Chepstow Festival of Arts.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Yeah.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So each year, Chepstow gets together and artists from all over Chepstow make different pieces

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
to be displayed in the town.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Yeah.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So what we were doing, we were doing self-portraits, weren't we?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Yeah.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So you drew yourself and they're going to be displayed on the church railings.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Yeah.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So it'll be an art installation of hundreds, hopefully, if enough people do it, hundreds

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
of self-portraits going all the way down the alley.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Yeah.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I think it'll be beautiful when it's finished.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Yeah.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So do you enjoy doing stuff like that?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Yeah.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Art and things?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I like making stuff and doing whatever, like making stuff and going out and doing stuff,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
helping each other.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Like earlier, I had to help Tasha because she can't get the jelly on the spoon because

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
she's shaky and she drops it on the floor or drops it everywhere, so I fed her this

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
morning earlier with the jelly.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Yeah.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
You're very helpful, aren't you?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Yeah.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Especially to the other service users that come here.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Yeah.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You're always offering or helping them.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And I like to wish I could push Tasha because I know I'm not allowed to push wheelchairs,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
but I wish I could.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Yeah.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
You're always eager to help, but that's just...

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Yeah.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Because I like helping.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Yeah.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Because when we went out the other day and I think I pushed her out from here to the

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
end of the road.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Yeah.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And then somebody took her over to the other side, it was Keely, and said, you want...

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And Keely couldn't remember my name, so she went, do you want Kelly to push you?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
She went, yeah.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So I pushed her to the castle and then I pushed her back to the main road and then Annemarie

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
pushed her across the road and I said, Annemarie, I'll take her.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Are you sure?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I said, yeah.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And then I pushed her back in here then.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Yeah.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
That's just a health and safety thing, mate.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Yeah.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And I just like to help.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
You do.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I mean, I just like to push because that's me.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I like pushing.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I don't know what it is.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
You're very tanky.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I just like pushing people.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And I wish I could push Jordan, but I know I can't.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
No, his is an electric wheelchair.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So it takes a little bit of practice and stuff.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But if Sarah said to me, do you want to have a little go and I can help you, that'd be

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
all right.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I just wish I could do something.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I'm sure you would, but unfortunately with our job, we've got to risk assess things and

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
health and safety.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So...

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I know.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So that's one thing I wish I could do to push.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I know, yeah.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
But if you're fine to push Tash in a wheelchair because she lets you...

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
If Sarah said to me, do you want to push Jordan around here or down the bottom or something,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I would have a go with Sarah.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
But I just wish I could, but I can't.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I know.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
There's certain things that...

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Because I like to help and push people and help people and wheelchairs and whatever.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
That's me.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I like helping.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
You can.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I'm sure you'd be able to do it but unfortunately we've just got to do certain things by procedure.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.500
by procedure that's all. I know. But no worries we're just grateful that you're so kind to everyone that you come and see.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:42.500
Yeah, because I like helping. You do. And I don't know why, I just like helping people like Tasha earlier, I've fed Tasha earlier

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:50.500
and I like helping and being helpful. Yeah. Making teas and doing whatever. You're a generous person aren't you? I know.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:13:01.500
Okay, so we got up to, how many days a week do you come to make out? Thursdays, all day Thursdays. All day on a Thursday. Yeah. Nice.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:09.500
So we did the art this morning. Yeah. Have you got anything else planned for the week? Yeah. Have you got anything else planned for this week?

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:16.500
I'm going dancing with Keely on Saturday. Are you? I'm going to Fort Sardine. Oh wow, what are you doing at the moment?

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:24.500
I'm dancing with all of the different groups. But Keely's picking me and my niece up from my house about past eight I think.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:33.500
Yeah. Because she's got to drive from my house to wherever the coach is and then the coach will pick us all up and then drive us to where we've got to go.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:40.500
And then we do a few dance and then get back on the coach and then whatever. And then I'm staying at my dad's Saturday night with my niece.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:59.500
So what kind of dancing is that? It's like, it's widows with sticks and all and we do like the seven tunnel much one lock, garers, fairy, old town and everything.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:06.500
Yeah. So is that what you'd call Morris dancing? Yeah. Am I right in saying that? Yeah. How long have you been doing that for?

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:18.500
I'm not sure because I'll tell you the story of this, mate. I went into town one day, one day where I used to live somewhere, I can't remember.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:24.500
And I walked down the road and I was like, right, left, right. I was like, what the hell is all this? Jingle, jingle, jingle.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:32.500
I was like, what the hell is all this? They're all camping at the school, coming down the hill with all the jangles and raggles and stuff.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:41.500
And I went in there with them and I went, hiya, my name is so and so and so. I don't know if Keely was there, I can't remember.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:49.500
So and so and so. And I stayed with them and mum run me, you're not in the way, are you? I went, no, not in the way.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:56.500
And they let me play the tambourine. They went, bloody hell, Kyle, you've got the beat. I said, right, okay. So then she run me again.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.500
No, I'm not in the way. And they took me to a, they was dancing at the Chepstow Castle up the steps.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.500
Yeah. And I went up there and I said, can I come? Yeah, yeah, of course you can. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.500
So I went up there. But I didn't like coming down the steps because it's like that and I don't like it.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.500
Bit too steep. So yeah, so I had one of the widows still with my hand all the way down the bottom.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.500
And I said to my mum, I'm joining the widows. She went, no, you're not. I said, yes, I am.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:29.500
I'm one of the widows guys. He's dead now. Right. He gave us a crawling tent, like a crawling tent.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.500
And mum went, oh, what? We're in one of them. I said, yeah, yes, we're in one of them.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.500
And we had the air bed. Do you know what the name of the air bed, Mike? Is this when you're camping with the widows?

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The first time widows. You know the air bed she lie on? The bed went.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:48.500
And mum said, that is it. We're not doing camping anymore. I said, yeah, we are.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.500
So now she's got a camper van now so we can do all the widows and everything.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.500
Oh, so you're camping in style now. Yeah, yeah. Lovely.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.500
Because all the widows took the mick out of us because when we all had the tent, we had everything.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:06.500
And they all took the mick out of us. Oh, look at them. And they took the mick out of us.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.500
And they took the mick out of us. Yeah.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:16.500
One of our widows, Fran's partner, Mike, like you, tall like you, he's not here anymore.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:22.500
He passed away. Two of my widows have passed away. And he was drinking like you do, Mike.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.500
And he got up to have a drink. We'll edit that bit actually.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:30.500
Yeah. He got up to have a drink. And he fell over all over the tent.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.500
Went flying over the tent to go to the toilet. We were all laughing at him.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.500
I've done that a few times at festivals. Those guy ropes are deadly.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.500
Yeah, and he fell over and we were like, what are you doing?

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.500
And one of my cousins, he's my cousin. I didn't know he was my cousin.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:51.500
Reece, who's my cousin who lives in Caldecon. I didn't know he was my cousin.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:57.500
And he scared the hell out of me. I was only crying because he's my cousin and I'm like, like you would.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.500
My other cousin, Terry, who takes the widows now.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:08.500
We camped up like the river, like the river, you know these long rivers, what takes really too far down.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.500
Yeah. And my cousin went, oh, I know what to do. Yeah. I said, what are you doing, Terry?

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:18.500
He went to the river to wash all this black off. And my cousin fell straight in the river,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.500
holding a tree trunk, going, help, help.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.500
And I think there was about five guys or six sides to drag him out because he's a big lad.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.500
There was a couple of guys dragging him out, trying to get him out the pool.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.500
So it sounds like you have a lot of fun with the widows on your trips.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.500
Yeah, we have loads of fun with the widows and having a laugh.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.500
And it all started by just asking if you could join in. Yeah.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.500
And you're saying about he was at the river washing the black off his face.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.500
It's because you wear all black makeup over your face.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:57.500
Yeah, but we can't, we can't wear that anymore because it's races or sun ink. I don't know.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.500
So we're not allowed to put any widows through sometimes like Keely does,

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.500
but sometimes we get told off by my cousin Terry because Terry takes it now.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:10.500
But make use to take it, but you don't take it anymore because we left some of the widows.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.500
Because they're black in and they all had the arguments and everything.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.500
Keely will explain that to you, but I can't get the word out.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.500
So some of the widows are left, but we've got some new people in there.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.500
And some people just put like swirls and dots and lines across.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.500
But I didn't last time and I got told off by my cousin.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.500
He was like, you're not allowed to do that.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.500
You've got to put purple or blue on your face.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.500
Do you understand why they don't do that anymore?

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.500
No, I don't know. It's like a racist or something.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.500
Yeah, you're along the right lines. Yeah, something like that. I don't know.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:56.500
People of colour, people with black skin were often shown in films and stuff

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.500
as not in a very nice way.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.500
White people used to put black makeup on to make themselves look like black people.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.500
And it's not very good taste and it can be seen as racist.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.500
But I know the widows, that was never their intention.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.500
Because I think you're meant to look ghostly and ghoulish, aren't you?

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.500
You're almost kind of scary.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.500
And my nunty does it with me as well. My niece does it with me.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.500
But she done it in Chepstow one day and all her mates took the piss out of her,

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.500
laughed at her and made her cry.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.500
And she won't dance around here. She's like 13, but she won't dance in town.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.500
She's dancing on Saturday with me, but she won't dance in town.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.500
No, that's fair enough.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.500
Because I said, come on, Nomsie, let's do it.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.500
We call her the Noms from the garden.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.500
And I said, come on, Nomsie.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.500
She was like, and her mates seen her and took the piss out of her and she went on crying.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.500
It was boys out there at school who took the piss out of her.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.500
How old is she?

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.500
She's 13.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.500
It's an awkward age.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.500
Yeah, because we was at the Widdabah, the Legion.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.500
And she was doing a couple of dances.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.500
And there was boys just sat by on the steps.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.500
And they recognised it was her.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.500
And they were just like, hahahaha.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.500
Unfortunately, kids can be horrible, mate.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.500
So she wouldn't do it and she won't dance around here.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.500
So she'll just come dancing wherever you go in or whatever.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.500
Yeah, and hopefully you can give her the confidence to maybe do it.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.500
Yeah, and she won't do it around here.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.500
Well, she might if you keep, you know, stick with her and say, you know, you've got your team around you.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.500
Yeah, I do, I do stick with her, but she just won't do it around here because they took the piss out of her and made her cry.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.500
People can be jealous, mate.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.500
Especially when they see people enjoying themselves.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:49.500
She said, I am coming back and I'm not dancing in town because my mates and all took the piss out of her.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.500
You don't let it get to you, though, do you?

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.500
No, I don't. I just like, oh, shut up, get lost or whatever.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:04.500
That's me. But I just I like looking after her and I love her because she's my niece and I make sure she's OK and yeah, and whatever.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.500
Well, you look after her and hopefully she'll build her confidence back up to do it locally.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.500
Yeah, I would like to, but and sometimes she gets so stroppy sometimes.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:21.500
If you tell her no, she'll walk off and you just can't do anything about it because she just never listens.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.500
And she's done it on Wednesday when we went dancing and whatever.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.500
And she's done it in front of her dad and everything as well.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:35.500
And she is a nice girl, don't get me wrong, but if you tell her no, she can't do that, she'll walk off.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.500
That's teenagers, mate.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.500
That's what she's like.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.500
I'm sure as my mum will tell you, I used to say no quite a lot at that age.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.500
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.500
I'll tell you what I do know about you with regards to the widows.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.500
You don't forget a step, do you?

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.500
No, no.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.500
You've got it absolutely perfect, haven't you?

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.500
Yeah.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.500
And people quite often follow what you're doing.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.500
Yeah.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.500
I'm going to go and get Keely.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.500
But before we go and get Keely, can I tell you I'm going to Disneyland Paris?

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.500
Oh, please do.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.500
I'm going there for my birthday when I'm 40 this year.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.500
Wow.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.500
Because I've been wanting to go to Disneyland Paris for a long, long time.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:28.500
And I've been asking my dad, when I used to live with my dad, I want to go to Disney.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.500
And he was like...

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.500
So I said to my mum, I would like to go because I haven't been for ages.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.500
And my auntie and my uncle from Kent, they've been there.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.500
And I've got some pictures.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.500
When we finish this, I'll show you some pictures of my auntie and my uncle in Disney.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.500
And I wanted to go there, but I haven't been there.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.500
So I said to my mum, I would like to go.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.500
And she said, so we sorted out with my uncle.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.500
And we're going Wednesday the 13th.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.500
And we're coming back home on the Saturday.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.500
Amazing. And that's for your fourth year of birthday.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.500
And I can't wait to go to see Mickey and Goofy.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:11.500
And we're staying in a room like this, but like a shed thing, if you know what I mean.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.500
A chalet?

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.500
Yeah, a chalet thing, or whatever you call it.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.500
But my uncle's got a drive to Disney. It's not that far.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.500
And we're going down on there Monday or Tuesday, me and my mum from here to Kent.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:29.500
And then my uncle's, we've got to get up early Wednesday morning.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:34.500
Because he's driving his camper van all the way to Disney.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.500
Really? So you'll be getting the ferry over to France?

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.500
No, not the ferry, getting a train.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.500
Oh, you're going on the U-boat.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.500
Yeah, but my uncle's van in the back is so bumpy.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.500
Every time we go to the back, we should be doing this all the time.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.500
Because it's so springy and you just keep doing all this all the time.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:58.500
And so it'll be me, my uncle and my auntie and my mum.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:04.500
And we're taking Janet's son's daughter Bonnie.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.500
Because the other grandkids, Steve's, they've all been, but Bonnie hasn't been.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.500
So Bonnie's coming with us.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.500
And Janet, I believe, is your mum's sister?

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.500
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.500
Because I was in school with Janet.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.500
Yeah, yeah, so they're taking me to Disney.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.500
Oh, you're going to have a great time.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.500
Have you ever been to France?

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.500
No, I haven't.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.500
Oh, that'd be cool. So you've seen Disney and France at the same time.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:33.500
Yeah, so I'm going to go and see Goofy and Mickey and have loads of pictures and go on the rides and everything.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.500
Do you like roller coasters?

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.500
Yeah.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.500
They've got some great rides there.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.500
Yeah, I love rides.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.500
Make sure you go on the Ratatouille ride.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.500
Yeah, what was your favourite ride, Mike?

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.500
Probably the Ratatouille ride, I think.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.500
Yeah?

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.500
Yeah, of all of them. That was good fun.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.500
What was yours, Sue?

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:55.500
I like the scary rides. So was it Space Mountain? In the Dark?

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.500
Space Mountain. That one's, that's the American one.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.500
I like the, like I...

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.500
It might be in France, but I remember that one in America.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:11.500
Mike, I like the one where you can walk up and it's like where you get married and you go on like a train. I've seen that.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:19.500
And you go in and you've got like a witch, like who's got married on top of the stairs and you go through, I can't remember what it's called.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.500
Oh, it sounds spooky.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.500
Yeah.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.500
Kind of like a ghost train type thing.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:29.500
Yeah, and then you've got people dancing at the bottom and you've got like, like if you went to somebody's wedding and all.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.500
I know what it is.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.500
I can't remember.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.500
It's something like the Ghost Mansion where you've got holograms spinning.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.500
Ah, I see, yeah.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.500
Yeah, it's like, you know, haunted.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.500
I know that when you're on, the haunted house Friday, I believe it is, isn't it?

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.500
Yeah.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.500
Ghost dancing in the cemetery.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.500
Yeah.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.500
And then you go through, yeah, I remember that actually.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.500
Yeah.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.500
And the function hall, like the ball.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.500
Yeah.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.500
Yeah, and all the cutleries moving, isn't it?

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.500
And it's all kind of, the whole house is doing things.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.500
And I can't wait when I go there now, I'm all excited.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.500
Ah, dude, I'm so jealous.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.500
Yeah.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.500
Can I go to Disneyland for my four year, please, mum?

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.500
If you're a good boy.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.500
All right, I've got eight years, eight years to wait, Cal.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.500
I can't wait because I haven't been there before, but my auntie and my uncle's been there.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.500
So when we finish this, Mike, I'll show you some pictures.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.500
I would love to see some photos.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.500
Yeah, if my auntie and my uncle's been there.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.500
You quite often show me photos of your holidays.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.500
Yeah.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.500
And your mum writes in kind of like a journal for you, doesn't she?

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:34.500
Yeah, I've got a book at home and I write it all out, what I've been doing, and then put pictures on it and all.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.500
Yeah, it's like a diary of all the holidays you've been on, isn't it?

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.500
I've got it at home, so I've taken it with me and then I can show you there, Mike.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.500
Yeah, wonderful.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.500
Yeah.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.500
I'd like to see that.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.500
Yeah.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.500
Well, I hope you have a great time and I'm sure you're going to.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:49.500
Yeah.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:57.500
OK, this seems like a good point to have a little drinks break and then we'll bring Keely in to talk a little bit about the widows afterwards.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.500
Yeah.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.500
That sound good to you?

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.500
Yeah.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.500
Cool. Anything to add, mum, before we go?

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:08.500
I'm just wondering, Keely, which we can talk about later, did you ever used to go to Saturday Club?

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.500
Yes.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.500
And did you used to go swimming?

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.500
I did, but I'm not that strong swimmer and not that.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.500
Is there anything you want to say about Saturday Club?

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:23.500
I love Saturday Club because I used to go with Sarah Marsh.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.500
Yeah.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.500
And we used to go swimming and we used to play tennis or whatever, I can't remember.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.500
But we used to play and I used to laugh at Sarah because she was so mad as hell.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.500
And I used to take the mic out of her.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.500
I was like, what are you doing, Sarah?

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.500
And laughing at her and everything.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:44.500
And I used to bring some food in, like, for other people to eat, like you and Mike and whatever.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.500
And I used to do swimming, but I can't swim.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.500
So the Saturday Club was where?

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.500
The Red Centre.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.500
OK. And that was there for a long, long time.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.500
I'm not sure how long that was, don't ask me, I can't remember.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.500
OK. And what did you like about going to Saturday Club?

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.500
I just liked to be with my friend Sarah.

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:07.500
Yeah.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.500
Yeah, because I like Sarah Marsh, but I do miss her.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.500
Because I know we've got Sarah Gwell as well, but Sarah Marsh is more better and funnier than Sarah.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.500
You have Sarah.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.500
Because Sarah Marsh makes me laugh a bit more funnier.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.500
But Sarah Gwell sort of gets a bit grumpy and a bit, you know what I mean?

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.500
She's not being horrible, but you know what I mean.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.500
It's different personalities, they happen to have the same name.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.500
Yeah, because Sarah Marsh was so funnier, made me laugh and everything.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.500
But that one in there, she says, OK, can you stop doing that?

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.500
Do you know what I mean?

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.500
And I love her, but the other one's more better than her.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.500
And I like the other Sarah.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.500
We don't have to compare Sarah.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.500
No, but you know what I mean, Mike.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.500
I do, yeah.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.500
I like you.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.500
I think Sarah Gwell is one of the best kids we've got here.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.500
She is, but I like Sarah Marsh more.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.500
I love Sarah Marsh too.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.500
I like that one more than that one.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.500
I don't mind that one, but I like the other Sarah because she makes me laugh.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.500
And when we went on the buses, she used to make me laugh and a joke.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.500
But that one in there, don't.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.500
She just gets a bit, you know what I mean?

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:18.500
Sarah Marsh is going to be thrilled that you enjoyed her company.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.500
Yeah, and I do miss her.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.500
So I think at this point, as Michael said, we're going to take a break.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.500
Yeah, and then get Keely in.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.500
Yes, and then you and Keely can tell us some more stories about the Widders.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.500
Yeah.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.500
And can we play this so we can show Keely later, please?

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.500
If we've got time at the end, I can play some of the interview.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.500
You will get to hear it all at some point.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.500
Probably when I've had a bit of a play around and Eddie's did certain things.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.500
All right.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.500
Maybe cut out a bit of our high drinking.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.500
But no, you've been great so far, Cal, so we'll stop there, okay?

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.500
Yeah.
