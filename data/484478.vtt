Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project, interdueur Steve Fletcher, interviewee Alice

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.560
Chapman-Viersma. The date today is Sunday the 25th January 2015. The venue for the interview

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.440
is the Swicker office. Alice, for the record, would you be kind enough to spell your name

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:36.840
in full please? Absolutely, now married Alice Wearsma-Jones. A-L-I-C-E-W-I-E-R-S-M-A-

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.240
hyphen J-O-N-E-S. That's very kind of you. Sorry for getting you. It's fine. Sorry if we're not

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.520
married. We recently married. No absolutely. I've known you for a long time. It's magic. So how did

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.240
you first come across the Cardiff Carnival? Okay, wow, my first experience with Carnival.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:04.600
I think that it can be put into three categories. First as a consumer, second as a participator,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:14.600
and then third as a facilitator. So, consumer, very young child, on the shoulders of my father,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.880
perhaps in Butetown, perhaps in the town centre, probably in Butetown actually considering how

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.320
long it was ago. I can remember big jangly glittery sparkly things coming past me and lots of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:38.200
jemming and lots of exciting sunny happy shiny memories. Second as a participator, I think I'm

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.440
gonna have to start with my memories of Jab Jab. So being perhaps 14, 15 years old and coming down

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.880
to the Chapter Art Centre, obviously leading up to this sort of lots of making and sequins sticking

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.720
and glittering and all of that sort of stuff. But then I remember a very sunny afternoon,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.440
sort of packing up all of the costumes, helping to pack up all the costumes and then coming back down

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.440
a really, really sunny evening, being instructed to wear as little as possible.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.960
So coming in a pair of hot pants and a bikini top and covering ourselves from head to foot in mud,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.240
so mud on our legs, mud on our arms, mud on our bellies, mud stripes on our faces,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.880
and being given two sticks and banging them together and marching through the town centre

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.600
saying you know me well Jab Jab I come from hell Jab Jab you know me well Jab Jab I come from hell

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.720
obviously with all the Jemmas and what have you. And yeah being only sort of I must have been about

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.920
14, 15, perhaps 16 and then ending up in the Welsh Club and just having the best night of my life,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.840
ridiculously underage. But they're not going to be able to tell and I'm covering myself in mud

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.480
and obviously with lots of different people and yeah just having a great time and meeting

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.880
Melissa, Carnival Jem dancer, Melissa for the first time. She was seeing a school friend of

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.160
mine Sam at the time and yeah just having a great time dancing with her and enjoying life, loving

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.320
life, really loving the Carnival. And then must have been the next day or the day after that

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.400
doing the Carnival Parade with my friend Zoe Hewitt who's also a Carnival artist.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.280
So yeah really fond memories of that sort of first getting involved experience in the Carnival.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.880
And then a bit later on in life obviously through the teenage years having such a great time myself

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.800
wanting to pass that experience on to children that I work with as a teacher, educator. I wasn't

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.960
actually a qualified teacher at the time I was a learning support assistant working in a school in

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:05.880
Trowbridge and I got a little carnival group together in school and we did lots of face painting

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:15.480
and we made our own costumes, we tie-dyed some clothes that the kids brought in actually,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.520
I just asked them to bring in some white clothes and we tie-dyed them into tiger colours

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:30.120
and for the parade itself we painted our bodies in tiger paints and we danced in front of Rocco

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.720
and his in steel pans and I think that for me was the the most rewarding carnival experience I've

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.960
had for the first time bringing a bunch of kids down. Obviously Trowbridge at the time was a very

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.080
very white area, not so much now because we've got lots of refugee communities that have moved

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.680
into the area with the whole the government's dispersion ideas and what have you but at the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:02.280
time it would have been our kids' only sort of exposure to Caribbean culture and they absolutely

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.080
loved it coming down and getting involved in mass and then the actual parade itself,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.960
it was just really really wonderful for them and obviously my experiences growing up of carnival

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.720
loving it myself but then being able to work with young people and get them involved in a project

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:30.520
that they would otherwise not have the possibility to access, just really really rewarding,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.080
really rewarding and just great for them as well to have that experience. The area that I'm teaching

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.600
is socially deprived and economically deprived but also culturally deprived,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.240
not like you know your classic schools down the bay or in Grangetown or whatever. Obviously there's

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:56.520
lots of culture and colour and life and things happening in those areas, there's lots going on

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.960
all the time but in Trowbridge it's right on the edge of the city. When the shops burnt down it

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.520
took them three years to rebuild them so you're looking at the poorest people in Cardiff having

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.320
to catch a bus to go and buy a packet of cigarettes so you know there's nowhere for

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.800
them to go shopping let alone for them to go and dance and sing and sort of experience a

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.080
cultural event as it were so being able to provide that experience for those children

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.960
has just been fantastic. That's brilliant, you yourself personally have played a number of

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:42.120
different costumes when you're not entirely covered in mud. Any of them spring to mind for

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:49.160
reasons good bad or good bad or ugly? I think straight away the first thing that comes to mind

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.680
is that tiger costume that I was talking about earlier having got these kids who have very little

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:02.200
to go and buy their own white clothes for them we witch tie dyed and then painting them from head to

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:10.840
foot in tiger coloured paint and then that year actually pissed down with rain. Is that a technical

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:18.520
term? I sort of promised them holiday clothes that they could wear and they were really quite

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.680
excited to have these new little skirts and whatnot that were tie dyed so they were looking

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.760
forward to taking them camping and what have you and then of course it rained and I think if I just

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:35.160
stuck to the yellow and orange it would have been fine but I put black tiger stripes over the top

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:41.480
of the yellow and orange dapples and their face paint ran all over their costumes and they were

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.160
completely ruined. The kids seemed absolutely fine about it. Isn't it weird what's your attitude

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.280
with rain and carnival because it doesn't we've worked so hard and such a feeling of wanting to

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.160
you know the gun is loaded and come the day you really want to go down that road and do your thing.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.960
Yeah it hasn't that wasn't the only rainy year I can remember the the second year I took a bunch

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:08.840
of kids I deliberately designed umbrellas with that group. I'd been to the pound shop in town

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.200
and I bought seven or eight or twelve or however many kids I had that year matching umbrellas and

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:20.520
we'd spent the week decorating them with sequins and putting sort of jewels around the edges and

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:26.600
sparkles hanging bits even and it was they were really really pretty but I think after about a

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:32.040
mile or less than that even we dumped them and we were just dancing in the rain having a great time

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:40.520
so I really you know I think that obviously the sun shining it's beautiful I think maybe the people

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:47.480
watching the carnival have a better time but in terms of us lot getting involved in dancing away

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.120
I don't think the weather really matters at all. Well your enthusiasm and passion for carnival has

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.120
been some self-evidence and as you say you've gone through these three different stages but

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:05.240
besides the carnival I mean you've even raised money and attracted swicker to do a carnival project

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:11.880
at your school taking us back to the source as it were so I'd just say a few words about

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:17.960
carnival Europa because it was a great experience. Yeah well I think that the there's two projects

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.360
really sticking my mind there and the first one being the lantern parade that you guys did for us

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.800
which was initially supposed to be a summer carnival but of course the funding didn't come

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.640
through in time so then hoping to save that money for the following summer and then realising that

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:40.120
the money had to be spent in this within a certain time frame as well so we ended up doing after your

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:46.680
your advice and ideas we did a winter lantern parade and that was magical for me having never

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:53.160
experienced or got involved in any of your lantern parades in the past. It was children

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.800
using willow and paper to make these sort of fantastic structures which we then were able

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:06.360
to light up. Fabulous for the kids I think lots of the parents assumed that we were making those

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:12.520
Chinese lanterns that you let off up into the sky so when I told them that we'd be sort of carrying

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.920
these lanterns on sticks and they get to actually take them home at the end of the day they were

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.880
just they were absolutely loving it and for months we had these incredible structures sort

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.680
of hanging all over the school which were just beautiful that sort of rainbow colours and white

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:32.280
and yeah that was really magical so you know my first experience of making something much more

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.880
three-dimensional than a headdress or a costume that was really fantastic and seeing you know

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.400
a carnival in the middle of winter as well I think we called it light up the streets with

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.800
Trowbridge or something and that was really great seeing the people out on the streets

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.880
seeing the kids dancing and having that sort of carnival fever feeling in the middle of January

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:58.920
that was really fab. Carnival Europa I think that was more towards the summer it's been so many I

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:08.120
can't remember now but yeah again going back to the the real real fact that there is no cultural

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.640
experiences in that part of Cardiff there was nothing for kids to get involved in

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:20.360
just seeing that area come alive with colour and costumes and music and people out in the park

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:26.120
watching us dance and the children's involvement just absolutely magical really really special

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.120
experience for the kids and for the staff involved. And for team Swicker they came

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.240
plus I remember the French Cockerel was a big thing a French Cockerel I mean they they come back

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.040
every day and sort of talk about that and yeah it was like yeah we had European students absolutely

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:46.360
yeah they were great really nice bunch of bunch of students um yeah we all were European worked

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.680
really well with the kids and it was quite nice to have you know yes they sort of worked on their

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.960
sections of the parade one of the fab things as well um you guys gave all the teachers a costume

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:03.400
and they sort of naturally as teachers do formed their own group in the carnival parade so we had

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.320
the French section the Spanish section and then the teachers section

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:13.560
somewhere near the back it was fab and then we all were and obviously I was running around but the

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.120
rest of them were all there and they were dragon wings and giant headdresses and whatnot just

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.160
looking absolutely fantastic that was one of the things that Adrian carnival organiser really liked

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.720
yeah he was like I love the way your teachers formed a section and there was a teacher's section

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.840
going on the back with a head teacher and everything and a beautiful headdress

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:37.560
yeah it's absolutely fab and at this point I'd like to award you the completely valueless but

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:47.160
invaluable accolade of a Cardiff carnival hero for your longevity for the three different ways in

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:53.320
which you have contributed and enjoyed Cardiff carnival but I think the one that becomes most

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:59.160
important uh I'd like to just underline is as a facilitator a gatekeeper who

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:07.320
who has no doubts is the value of carnival and constantly has you know gone an above and above

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.280
and beyond the call of any kind of duty to make sure that other people and young people in

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.880
particular can have an opportunity so Alice you are hereby officially dubbed Cardiff carnival hero

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.200
thank you very much that's really kind
