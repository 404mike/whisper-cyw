00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
My mother and father were very friendly with Peg and Dave.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And they were related to Peg. I think one of them was related to Peg.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But anyway, they were very friendly and lived in Odfellow Street, Peg and Dave.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Williams, Dave Williams.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And he, at the time, of course they got to know Joe, obviously being intellectual as well.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And Peg was invited by Katriona to go up to the Isle of Skye.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
For a week, I'm not sure how long.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Anyway, up they went and Peg said,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Well, what are we doing here? Well, we're going to have a dinner tonight.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
He said, you'll meet all the krachach, she said, of the Isle of Skye.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So they sat at the table and Peg didn't say much of anything.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
She didn't know them. And Katriona started saying,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
What a wonderful bathroom Peg had.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And all mother of pearl and all. It was an exquisite bathroom.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And Peg just looked. She couldn't believe this because she didn't have a bathroom.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Didn't have a bathroom.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Things like that happened all through.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Peg enjoyed the luxury up there. Of course, servants bringing breakfast in bed and all that.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Anyway, back they came.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And after that it was a man in a rug.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Oh, my mother used to go there regularly.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Two Pegs in Odfellow Street now, this was.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And she looked at the half rug and she said,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It's a bit chubby, Peg. Yes, it is, Peg said.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We're going to Swansea on Saturday and we're going to buy a new one.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And my mother said, Oh, good. I'm looking forward to that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So my mother was very pleased that they were good. And she told my father, oh.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So she went back in about a week or so and called in Pegs.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And she said, Well, seeing the old one still there, she said, Well, where is it?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And Peg said, up there on the bookshelf. Four books.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That's what they'd gone to town.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And Dave couldn't resist them, she said. Had to have his books.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Yes, the books are more important.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So it shows how well he spent his money.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
He spent his money wisely.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Yes, he was a wrecking weight.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And then I knew Peg was working for, I think, the local Labour Party.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
She was writing a lot of stuff for them at the time, you know, same time.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And then, of course, Dave had a job in London with the NCB.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So he accepted that. And off they went to London for a while.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm not sure how long, but it was the time when this smog, they called it,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
was in London. She was a killer, really.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
But they were there because my mother and father went to, for a weekend, I think, to stay with them.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And yes, Peg and Dave were very intellectual.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Do you remember Joseph's visit to the Royal Academy?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Oh, yes.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
He was, that was late in his lifetime, really, that he was accepted by the Royal Academy and delighted, of course.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And they all went up for a meeting. I don't know whether Peg and Dave went, but Dave went, I think.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And my father passed away then, I think. So it was a bit later than that, again, 1960, more like 1970, 1980, is it?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So a bit further on down the road.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It was the visit to Katriona's brother's party. He was a politician.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Oh.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And Joe had to go up to this big dinner party.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Oh, that's right, yes.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Oh, he came over and he said to my father, I've been invited, Katriona and I have been invited to this political dinner.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Would you believe it? I didn't think much of that.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And my father said, oh, that's nice, Joe. What will you wear?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000
He said, as I am, painting clothes, spattered with oil paints, trousers and everything. And I'll go as I am.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Well, my father said, I've got a dinner jacket you can borrow. Oh, no, no, I'll go as I am. They like me or they won't like me.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So what happened was that Katriona's brother from the yellow sky had been appointed a liberal candidate for some constituency.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And that was, the dinner was in his honour. So when they came back, Joe came over and, well, how did it go?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Oh, grand, he said, very good. Were you embarrassed at all?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
My father thought going in compared to all these people in the evening talks.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So he didn't change his mind? He went adamant in his painting clothes?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
No, he didn't. No, he went as he was. And he said, no, they were embarrassed. Not me.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I always remember that. I was there.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So he was very strong, strong-willed. Yes. And he was more of a, take me as who I am. He wouldn't posh.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
No, no, he wouldn't. No. He was like that. But I don't know what you'd call it, really.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
But he was, no, no, he refused everything my father could offer. Well, only a jacket he could offer him anyway.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000
My father didn't go, no one did in those days very much. And no, were you embarrassed? No, they were.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.000
What are your memories of Joe sketching around the Strygon Lice? Was he often out with a pencil and paper sketching?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Occasionally. Occasionally. But of course he had done that in the initial, early days, I think.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So he did that earlier on in his time in the Strygon Lice? Yes, yes. But he went further afield, of course with my father, you know.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And sketching and with friends. And I think that was his, he was more concentrating on going underground, painting the colliers underground.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And my father took a photograph. My father was used to going down. And I think it was on his schedule in Colliery.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And it was a very deep mine. So he would, the lift, you know, go right down. So he took Joe there sketching the colliers underground.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And he'd built up this friendship with them then. Yes. Yes, he liked them very much.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And as you say, he was very interested in the working man and painting him. But he got on very well with your father too.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Oh yes. So he was very much involved with the family coming round every day. Yes. For Eastkick. Yes.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And your daughter Carol. Oh yes. She was small at the time. So she was a little child at the time. Yes.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And she was always under the table. You know the plush clothes with the fringe. Yes.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And Carol was always under the table and we had to call her out and offer her a biscuit or something before she'd come.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And then Joe came in. And then he saw she put, she knew there was a different voice and different accent you see.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So she pulled up the fringe that. And then when she saw him, she was all smiles. And he was talking to her and lifting her up onto his lap then.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Oh nice. So he was obviously part of the family a lot then. Yes.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Of course I was at an awkward age was I. You know. My twenties. Yes.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Did he sketch, paint any of the family? No he didn't. Did he cater any of the family? Did he take any of the family out?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:42.000
No he didn't. No he didn't actually. I don't know whether Joe's. Wendy. This one. Oh that's the one is it? Yes.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Yes and that one. Did you still go sketching? My father sketched as well. So perhaps he thought you know it was a bit awkward.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I don't know. But he never wanted to even, any one of us really.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So the family had some sort of creative-ness about them. So obviously Joseph obviously felt a kinship with your family.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Yes. Well I don't know. He was, I think he wanted a children didn't he? Very much. And the fact that he married again and had the children, I think he was very happy.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And Katriona it was some illness that really took the baby. She lost her baby, the first baby then. Well the final one for all I know.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And their parents came down and they, first of all they weren't very keen on having Joe as a son-in-law. Because he wasn't very well off you see.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:02.000
But then they gradually, when Katriona lost the baby they came down, the mother and father, and they made up, do you remember seeing them? No.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I didn't see them. I think a short visit I think it was. What were the favourite places that Joe enjoyed to go to in the Stugan light? You said about the cafe and the cinema.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:32.000
What other places did he enjoy to go into? Jim's shop. Oh yes he loved Jim's shop. Who was Jim? Jim and the Skedwin Arms is here. Directly across is a little shop.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I think now they're selling pet food. Yes. And everyone liked Jim. But Jim was a real socialist you know. More of a communist really. So whether they had that in common I don't know.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I don't really know. Can you tell us more about that side of Stugan light? Part of Stugan light was called the Red Square. My father was a socialist. But he wasn't, I don't know, but a communist.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:24.000
But I know Jim was because he used to have letters. Jim Lewis, the Kremlin, Red Square, Moscow. And he'd receive the letters. And oh just a laugh in those days.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:44.000
But I don't know how many were that way inclined. But socialism was big wasn't it? The Labour Party. Dialic was a communist. Oh there was yes.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Yes. Can you tell us a bit more about that? No my father was a socialist and that was it. But communism was creeping in. And there were a crowd of people who were very interested in the Russian left group you know.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And they went to live in the Ernest as I say a little community. I don't know whether you've ever heard of it. And very small. It grew of course. And when my father came out of university that's what he set up was the ILP, Independent Labour Party.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And my mother made 200 red ties. Sold them for the boys who were members. And they had dances. They held dances in a hall. I think it was behind the present co-operative stores in Ustrad.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Behind there. There was a big hall. And they had dances every Wednesday I think it was. And my mother said my father couldn't dance very well. But she made all these ties for the boys. It was quite creeping in I think.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I think definitely the communist side. That's of course the ILP had been going for years in Ustrad. And the valley. When we came to live here we met a few of the boys who were members.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Was Joe still in Ustrad and Leis then? We came here in 1960. No. He just left. 58. Yes. Just left. We'd have approved of that.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:14:00.000
What about Joan Littlewood? Oh yes. Joan Littlewood came. So many well known people came to lecture and perform in the welfare hall. Joan Littlewood was one. She had been in London.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:19.000
She was very big. You know. Well known. I think it was the Oh What a Lovely War. That was the one. Joan Littlewood. She was very good. And she came and we were sitting in the audience expecting the curtain to open.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:43.000
They came in from the side. The two little actors. They came in and we were surprised that that was a novelty really. Obviously seemed to be quite a very active place. It was. Because we had the cinema, we had the welfare hall for dances and everything. And the church hall. So we were well blest really.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So throughout the year there were events that everyone could join in with. This is a constant annual. Yes. From Christmas to Easter to parades. We had the carnival of course. The monkey parade. I'd like to know more about that. My grandmother used to talk about the monkey parade.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:35.000
That was a Sunday event. Can you tell me the origins of the monkey parade? No. I know that reading in the paper that there were only two towns or districts still holding a monkey parade. That was in Yorkshire. In York itself I think. York itself. And Estragonas. And Slavera rather. Slavera it was. There was nothing in Estragonas of monkey parades.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And we'd go on a Sunday after church. Our chapel. And everybody over 15 or 16 would go to the wood house. The road house. The road house. And what would you do there? And we went in there and we had an ice cream each. And then chatting. And then we'd start walking then down to the cinema.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And the boys would be waiting. And if you were lucky you would be asked to be escorted home. But if you weren't you would have to jump on the bus and penny ride home. So we always had to keep the penny in case we didn't strike lucky.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:40.000
So there were boys and girls socialising in one place? Yes. After the chapel did you say? The younger generation. Oh yes. I think most of them were. Well then the war came of course. And most of them went. The boys went.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I don't know whether the monkey parade. Because I was married then of course. And I don't know whether they kept on with the monkey parade after that. But it petered out anyway didn't it? Didn't last very long after that.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Are there any going in Swansea? No funnily enough but my grandmother, my mamgie, always used to talk about the monkey parade. The Morriston monkeys. On an evening going up and down Woodfield Street. Boys on one side, girls on the other. But I believe it was like what was the called? Monkey parade.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Well we did it in Pontetower. Up and down. After we went to chapel and then Rangosis, the Italian cafe. And then we'd walk up one side and the boys on the other side. It was like a parade. How did you know you were meant to do that? I don't know. A tradition.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:18:05.000
A tradition. For years it was going. And down here it was on the parade ground where the trees are. The avenue. And Nostra Gunlas from the capital cinema to the empire cinema. Up and down. Up and down all the time. Until you decided well, let's jump on the bus and go home.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:33.000
So you had to wait in case a young lad went to hold your hand or to walk you home. Excellent. Yes, well they were very polite and everything was nice. Different because we could afford one ice cream. My friend Esme, she wouldn't take an ice cream, she'd have a cigarette.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:54.000
And my friend Esme, she used to tell her, if you didn't smoke you could have one of these. It didn't make any difference. And she met two boys from, she thought they were from Oxford, they were from Oxford. So she thought Oxford University. Oh dear.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:13.000
But it had happened that they were Cullum Training College outside Oxford. But she still carried on with this trooper, he was a Yorkshire boy, and he went to the Air Force and was killed in the Battle of Bresin in the early days of the war.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:23.000
But you had so many dances in the week, so many dances in the welfare and the church hall.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Well, fair and the money. Church hall is a stretch on a Wednesday, and if you could afford it, once a month perhaps down in the rink here. That was very expensive because you had to hire a car, you know, to come back, town and back.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And Mr Griffiths had a beautiful car, Ford, I don't know, it was a special car anyway.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Not a Charabont?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:03.000
No, no, it was just a big car, you know, but a very luxurious car. And he used to charge us ninepence each to go to and down the valley.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
A bit like a taxi.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Yes, yes, that's right. So, we were so lucky to have a cinema and three dance halls if you wanted them.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And what kind of music were played at the dances?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Oh, modern up-to-date music. Everett Davies and his broadcasting band from Aberystwyth came down occasionally to a slavera.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.000
But we'd had to pay more, of course. We couldn't always afford him. But once a year he'd come for the old reunion, a slavera grammar school reunion.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And that's where we all went. I think it was about two and six, or something, a ticket.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And how old would you have been then when those dances were taking place?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Sorry?

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
How old would have you been when you went up to the dances?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I was 17, 18. I was married in 1941.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Sounds like a lot of fun.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Sounds like a lot of fun.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.000
1941, yes. Because the dances started, that's right, it should have been 1939.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And of course the rink was closed then. When we turned up one Saturday we'd come down with Mr Griffiths in his car and there was a big notice up.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.000
These premises are closed until further notice. Making them bomb proof or something.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Goodness.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Yeah.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
So how did the Sturgenleis change with the coming of World War II?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Well, the boys left, you see, the young boys. That was the trouble. And in the dances, it was very noticeable then.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
There were no boys. Hardly any. Only young, too young really for us.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Yes, yes.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
And then of course I was married then. And quite a few were married at the time.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Was there a change in the town? Obviously the younger men were out fighting.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Yes.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Was there a general change of...

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Yeah, well we used to have these...what do they call them now? Oh, my memory.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
There were special...

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Dances.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Efforts, yes.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Yes, raising money, is it?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Yes, raising money to send parcels out to them, you know.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Yes.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
We used to have those all through the war, really.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Fundraising.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Yes.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And we never thought they'd go and dream of things like that. They were always coming back.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Yes, of course. And with, obviously, Joseph Kimover, the Moser.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Oh, yes.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Were there other emigre residents in the Sturgenleis area at all? That you knew of?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Yes. Dr. Bullets. And there was Dr. Bullets, and he became very popular.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And he died recently, I think, about a year ago, or two years ago.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.000
And Mrs. Bullets, they ran away, actually, from Poland.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
They came down to Italy and then came across. They had two children then.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
So they lived in the Sturgenleis as well.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Yes. And of course, Joe had to leave because of his health. That's why he left.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Because he loved it there.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
The damp climate, is it?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Yes. The climate defeated him. Well, the doctor advised him to go.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:10.000
And yet, we thought he'd have gone to sunnier climes, you know, like France or Italy or somewhere.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
But London they chose anyway.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
But did he go to Paris in 1946 on a trip?

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Yes.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Do you know much about that?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Only that he, Katriona told us that he'd left to Paris to find out about his parents.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Oh, that was then, was it? Right, it was that time.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Yes, that was then, yes. Sorry, yes.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Did you do taking Wendy's sketching?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Oh, yes. I used to take her, yes.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Oh, yes, please tell. Please tell about that. That sounds like a lovely story.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
And she was very, no, she didn't want to go. And I said, well, if I come with you.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Oh, yes, she said, that would be all right, I think. She wasn't sure whether I'd make a difference.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:02.000
But anyway, we went round Pennebont, over the river, Pennebont, and down to Gyms and round to take scenes in the night.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:10.000
The lights fell on horses and cabs and buses and cars.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.000
I did one and he approved, and Wendy did that one, and I thought it was very good.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
I think that's the one, isn't it?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Yes.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Very good. And she was going to do art at all levels, you see. Then, of course, that was the time.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
So did Joseph influence Wendy's work?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Oh, yes. Oh, bigger than people and that, because he was with Roland Braud, you know, the Delbanco Gallery, and very popular.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Can you tell us more about those who visited Joe at his studio?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Oh, so many artists, weren't there? I don't know, particularly. Only the ones I mentioned were Dr. Roland.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
And there was another writer, and David Martin, of course, was a writer.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
And I think lots of people who we didn't even know, you know, at some times.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:22.000
So you sometimes get some characters coming down into the town from London and sort of made the place even more colourful than it was.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
And Catuina's come for dishes. She didn't have dishes.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Well, when they came, that's right, she didn't have enough dishes.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Or it was wartime and we were all rationed.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:46.000
And Joe came over and asked if my mother'd lend him some dishes for these people who came from London.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:56.000
So my mother said, well, my father, it was actually, found a flask, put a towel or something, and got all her best dishes and put them in.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
She didn't have any. And, don't bring them back broken, she said to Joe.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Which luckily he didn't, so he was always welcome then after that.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
So Catuina was preparing a banquet, was she?

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Oh yes.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
To impress the London art crowd.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
From London anyway.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
I don't know what I'm shouting, am I?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
No, not at all.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
I'm told I shout because I'm hard of hearing.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
But as Joseph has a figure around the town at that time.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Oh yes, Joe Bach.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Was it sort of, did he come?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Yes, brilliant.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
And he loved that.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
He loved to be called Joe Bach.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Did he fit, when he was saved, did he fit in straight away into the house?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Did he fit in straight away into the town?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Yes, I think they did.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Did he take a while to just...

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
And of course she was a cracker really, wasn't she, from the other sky.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
And must have found it a bit difficult settling in to Welsh life.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
But yes, I think I've written about all the shops in Ustrad, most of them.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And of course he went every day to get cherries.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Bag of cherries.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Bag of cherries.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
I don't know what a pound of cherries is, I imagine.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I think it was something to do with...

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
It all stemmed from something that happened in Warsaw.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Was it typhus?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Yes, they brought typhus in.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
To the ghetto?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
To the ghetto.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:45.000
And apparently, of course, half of them died, he said, but his family survived.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
And one day he was walking along and he'd got...

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Well, perhaps he didn't have the typhus.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
It would have killed him probably, because he was quite young then, about 16.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And he was walking along and he saw this cherry on a wall.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000
And he picked it up and it was so nice that he became...

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
A big fan.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Yes, yes.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Did Joe talk much about his past?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Well, he did initially, to my mother and father, particularly.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
About his mother, particularly, he was fond of his mother.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
He adored his mother.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And, yes, he was very fond of his family.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
His heart broke when he came back.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
But if I say the word Joseph Herman to you now,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
What are the first things that spring to mind?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
When I think of Joe?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Yes.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Oh, well, I just see him, actually.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Can you describe his physique?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Yes, well, he wasn't tall.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000
And he always wore this hat, this black hat and his green cloak.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
What was the cloak made of?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Oh, Harris tweed. Oh, it was. Really, yes, good.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Very good material.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
And that's how I remember.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
And, of course, in summertime he didn't have the cloak.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
He just came in this little waistcoat thing.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Brown waistcoat. I remember brown.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
And a shirt.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Sort of a check shirt.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
And corduroy trousers.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Always corduroy trousers.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Not very clean sometimes. Full of paint.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And my mother said, I wish he'd wash his trousers.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
I wish he'd have them cleaned.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
And my father said, yes, but think of the good work he's turning out.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Oh, yes.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
This was just about...

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
So Joseph was still around, still in Minister Gernice?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
No, this was when in the camera club.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
And he came up to me one night in the camera club.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
I was there. I attended as often as I could because I was keen on photography.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
And my jaw came in and he went right up to me, this finger, and he put it right there.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
He said you were pregnant.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
I didn't know. You know, you get embarrassed.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
I hope nobody had heard.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
And I went home and a few days later I found I was.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
And I spoke to Mr. Richards, the chemist, about it.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
And he said, yes, because this, when you're pregnant, this vein becomes enlarged.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
The vein in the eye.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
So I didn't know that, of course.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
And the jaw did. No, I don't think, perhaps he didn't.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
He just had that... Instinct. Yes.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
So did he always, did he smoke? Did he smoke a pipe?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
No, I don't remember him smoking at all.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
No, I don't think he did, no.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
And his outfits were always quite simple, but the best, if you had the Harris tweed.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Oh, yes.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
And of course, Katriona probably bought it because she bought eight of his paintings, didn't she?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
To help him, of course, you know.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Oh, she's lovely.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
I think they were well suited, but then something happened and they had to go away.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
And she fell ill, I think, and went home.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
What was their home like, the studio?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Can you remember what it looked like inside, where he worked?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Oh, where he worked.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Yes, it was, his easel was there, wasn't it?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
And he had this big easel and he had the small ones, you know, and all the paint work.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
It was a bit messy, actually.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
If you were house proud, I don't think you'd put up with it.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000
But then he turned out such lovely work, everyone appreciated that.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
And he was asked to lecture here and there, you know.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Did he lecture at Estragon Nice?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.000
In, well, the Cameraclub first, of course, and then the welfare hall and the church hall.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
He gave a lecture there, a few lectures.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
And I think were they popular lectures?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Yes, yes, they were all, yes, yes.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
And what were the lectures about?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Yes, oh, well, about his work.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And if he was painting something at the time, he'd talk about that.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
And they'd ask questions then, what kind of paint he does and brushes and all that.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
I went to one in the welfare.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
It was, oh, very well supported, that one.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
There must have been about 40 people there.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Yes, there was a lot going on at the time.
