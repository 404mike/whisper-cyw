00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.240
We went to see a band called Flowered Up at TJ's and they were kind of a London version

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.240
of the Happy Mondays.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.160
They had a guy called Barry Mooncult who was dressed as a flower on stage as their sort

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.320
of bears.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.100
They weren't very well known until the week before they appeared on the cover of NME or

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.600
Melody Maker and suddenly everybody wanted to go to this gig.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.160
I saw the promoter did a piece online saying that they oversold the venue by double from

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.320
what they should have had in there because literally everyone I knew in Newport at the

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.200
time wanted to be at this show.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.200
And it was the mid-summer Italian night, it was on the telly, it was a fantastic night.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.680
And we got in there and the venue was just so rammed.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.680
When you went to the loo or went to the bar, literally you had no chance of finding your

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.120
mates afterwards and it was so hot.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.640
It was ridiculous and TJ's was one of these venues when it got really full and sweat was

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.960
pouring off the walls.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.240
But I lost all my mates and we caught up outside and one of them, he lost his t-shirt and his

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.280
shorts in the mosh pit somewhere but he'd had a really good night and he didn't care.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.600
So we lived a couple of miles from Newport to Honsendo and he walked home in his boxers

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600
but he'd had a really good night and that's all that matters.
