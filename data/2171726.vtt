00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Looking at plans

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When Marina's ideas arrived they were interesting.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
A quote from some of the text.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The idea of the house is that it looks like a cave.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The ground floor is very dark.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The external walls are from stones and the additional parts that contain the kitchen, bathroom and the bed

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
are built in with concrete walls in organic form.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The sliding doors covering these can be painted and hung with canvases like a gallery.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
A curved wooden staircase was shown up to the first floor

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
with the wall beside it containing many little niches with hidden lights.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Leading out of the cave up to a more natural light upstairs there would be a studio workroom.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There are also some very clever ideas picking up on our brief of multifunctional use

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and inspirations that we discussed from caravan or boat interiors with folding tables and benches.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Her stairs were shown as a curving staircase

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and she was also proposing the ground floor to have some living room features as well as serving as a kitchen.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We concluded that our own ideas had been relatively safe and angular in design.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We couldn't wait to see what Manos had come up with.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In the event it was several weeks after the deadline that he himself had chosen

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that the first set of ideas from Manos arrived.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But they were worth the wait.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The plan itself was a single sheet of paper with a floor plan and elevation sketched as little coloured drawings.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The notation was so small on the original A4 that we could only read it after I'd enlarged it on our printer.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The plan also contained a series of messages to us.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I have elaborated a lot of other solutions but all seem to me very artificial, boxy, claustrophobic.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This one is probably the only one with Manos' full open plan room with light and social area.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So colours and materials, white stone as you indicated for the floor, eventually,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
visible iron beams for ceiling, rusted, niches in stone and pointed.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Rest of the walls pressed plaster plus old wooden planks and a lot of glass, plexiglass and colour.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
All the niches are invisible, pointed stone.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
All niches have interior lights. Any shelves are glass or plexiglass.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Some can be coloured.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The plan itself showed a wet room to the right of the front door with a staircase over which started at the back wall

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and turned 90 degrees to climb over the wet room.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The bottom half of the stairs before it turned were behind a floor to ceiling glass slate.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
There were niches on the other three walls.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The left hand side of the room was split between storage and seating at the back

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
with a kitchen area near the new window on the front wall.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
A glass or stone slab was drawn as a curved work surface which split the room and had stools underneath.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
A new small window was drawn in on the front wall to ventilate and light the wet room.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
A lot seemed to have been fitted in but we liked a number of the ideas

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and it seemed to make sense to have a ground floor social area as long as there was enough room.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We were so excited that we overlooked the lack of plan for the first floor.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
This was to follow a while later.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
In the meantime we sent some comments on the plan.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
This was the way we worked through the project as a dialogue.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Sometimes it felt we were in tune with each other.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
At other times there was a lot more work required to involve a joint solution.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Our first comments on the ground floor were

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
We like very much the design for the kitchen area with a separate social seating and breakfast bar.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We like it but we will need to ensure that sufficient storage and space for a fridge, microwave, oven combination etc.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Perhaps this could be combined with Marina's idea for an occasional bed.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
This seems a good position and divides the bathroom from the kitchen social area.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
We like the glass wall slate to the top idea.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We wondered if Marina's myriad of lit niches could be incorporated upstairs to light the way.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
This could be gorgeous.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The position on this wall is a good solution.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Separate from kitchen living, more space freed up, more privacy, light and ventilation is possible here.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Marina drew in a double door which seemed good and space saving but it looked like a traditional design too.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Any thoughts about the back wall niche as a gash of light and whether glass bricks are an option for this here or upstairs?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Upstairs, we've already sent some of our ideas but we're still unsure of the best position for access to the roof terrace.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
This will decide the stairs position.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
We've sent a picture of clever slide out stairs that we found.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Could this perhaps be possible?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Marina's positioning of the stairs in the lower part of the ceiling makes some sense.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
We see the first floor as lighter, able to get some air in through the French doors, small balcony and roof access.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:49.000
The purpose of the room, sleeping, sitting, entertaining, studying storage, all quite a challenge.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
We think it's going to be really good and we're very excited about the whole project.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
We had some further conversation and after some thought we sent more comments.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
We have some views on the overall colour scheme.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
We really like the tiny details you added to the house in Kritsa using coloured tiles.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000
We don't want to restrict your palette but would like something similar using plain etched textured patterned glass.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Using occasional details in textured translucent or metallic mosaic tiles in natural neutral white cream light or dark grey.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
In elks or shell stone rather than bright colours.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
This is because we like to change the colours in our home.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:45.000
If a definite colour is used on a fixed object, say the work surface or floor or tile surfaces, we're likely to get bored with it and we want to change it.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Also, a more neutral palette gives us more options for adding a wider range of colour.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We can add colour with furnishing fabric, household objects, lights, ornaments or accessories.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
These can be changed as and when we want to.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But to create the interest in more permanent features by limiting colour but interest in textures and finishes.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
We're not asking for bland but this will give you loads of scope to create something beautiful.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So that floor surfaces, shelves, glass, work tops and tiling will be light.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Neutral colours and accessories using brighter colours can be changed when required against the neutral backdrop of the house.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Finishes.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Although much of the house will have a modern look with glass, modern materials and lighting.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.000
We talked of using some old wood from the house, perhaps as cupboard doors to use some of the previous history of the house.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
This could be stained or colour washed or varnished over bleached paint.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Light and power.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
This needs to be sufficient and flexible for living, working and to zone areas.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
For example, the kitchen ground floor social area where feasible, energy efficient, low wattage or LEDs should be used.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Ground floor.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
One of Marina's plans showed a double front door which would be space saving within the thickness of the exterior walls.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:23.000
The new high level window for the bathroom could be constructed to include a shelf and some other storage is needed in the bathroom, perhaps in a niche or under the sink.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Ground floor windows.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Privacy should be maintained by use of mirrored glass.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Kitchen work surface.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Sufficient overhang should exist to avoid any diagonal lines being visible from appliances or storage below.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The new metallic pole to support the glass staircase could be utilised to clamp on an organic shaped curved tabletop that could be raised up to the ceiling and incorporated in 12 volts step down powered lighting unit.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The social seating area could be cut back on the right hand side to give clearer access and be level with the staircase glass.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The storage under this seating would be most useful.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Back wall niche to incorporate a row of glass bricks.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
First floor.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Lint niches on the right hand side wall up the stairs.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
In the front wall a long cupboard niche to be created with doors for storage, doors in recovered wood.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
A full glass top to roof shelves to be created out of glass, not coloured.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Back wall wardrobe storage to include drop down work surfaces for use at sitting height as desks.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Two double sockets within each at work surface level.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Bed sofa to be either board or constructed and will be against the front or left hand side wall leaving a clear view of the glass stairwell.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Sun terrace.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Sink for washing with tap on the top sun terrace could be on the floor in the top right hand corner.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Windows into the first floor room from the sun terrace.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
The plan for the first floor when it arrived echoed some of the features of the ground floor plans.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Stone wall niches with lights, the use of structural iron bars and glass.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:27.000
The most interesting feature was a proposal for a glass panel to the ground floor below a spiral staircase attached to a metal pole that went down through the building to the back on the left hand side of the ground floor seating area.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
The spiral would go up to the new roof terrace.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
The spiral staircase was described as a light well topped by a glass roof hatch.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
This would bring light down through the building.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
One night a short time later my mobile rang.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Hello, are you at home?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Yes.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Why?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It was Manos.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I'll be sending you a fax.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I've changed the plans.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
New ideas.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
You will see.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Ring me when it arrives.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I hope you like it and we will talk later.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Cooking the evening meal was put on hold.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000
The inbox was scanned for fax notification and after a short wrestle with the laptop a four page fax was printed out.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
New ideas certainly.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
The roof terrace would have a glass floor to go with the glass hatch and a glass spiral staircase.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Further closer examination of the plans revealed a partial glass floor in the first floor room as well.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The plan was annotated to bring light to the ground floor.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
The spiral stairs had been moved to a different corner of the building but it made more sense there.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It would be amazing but was there a sudden glut of plate glass in Crete?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
It would certainly be light but would heat be a problem?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
It was to be discussed.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
We call back.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
We love it.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Good.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But you need to think about it and the colour.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Here's a website link.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
You will see examples there with glass blocks that can be used on the terrace walls.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
The colours could be interesting.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Let me know what you think of the colours.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
We are now blocked until you speak to me.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
We will proceed with other parts of the plan.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The niches etc.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Now, do you know about kumquats?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
We answered yes.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Nervously.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Why?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Can you make marmalade or confiture with kumquats?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I have many of them outside my window.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
The conversation was taking a Cretan turn.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
There was much to consider even before the question of kumquat chutney.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
We eventually recommended using a bottling of the surplus.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Perhaps in Brandew or Metaxa.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Have you tried this?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Well no.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
We don't exactly get snowed under with kumquats in Sussex.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Or Metaxa come to that.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
We have talked enough.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
The phone went dead.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Still it felt like progress of sorts.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
The next spring visit.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The first visit of this year was an opportunity to stay in a house that had already been renovated.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Impressively, this was the one we'd visited by torchlight only six months previously.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
We arranged to meet with Manos in a cafe near the office in the port.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
After a daytime flight, we found ourselves in the cafe above the new marina.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Enjoying a very welcome cooling drink.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000
He arrived late and flustered and welcomed us with a flurry of sorrys and bristly double cheek kiss each.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Oh, it's been hectic in the office today.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Less hectic, I quietly and unkindly thought to myself now that you're here with us and not still there.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
We had some more drinks and after Manos had relaxed and briefly discussed some of his plans for our house,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000
it was agreed we would follow him in our hire car up to the renovated house in the hills.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
It was just as well that we did.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000
We'd previously been driven there in the dark and I doubt that I would have found it again in the rabbit warren of streets and alleyways.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Eventually we drove up at the side of a large storm drain

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and after parking the cars crossed over into the track.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
To our right at the end of a small street was a smart new green stained wooden door

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
set in a newly pointed stone wall with a newly plastered wall over it.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
This is the house, come in said Manos unlocking the door.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000
We'd only seen the house once before the renovation works in the dark by torchlight.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
There'd been a transformation, the inside was bright and airy, a mix of plastered and original stone walls,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
there were lots of modern lights, a fitted kitchen and interesting objects and furniture.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Manos opened the fridge and took out a bottle of wine and opening it said,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
please make yourself at home here, use the food and drink, they are for you

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
and let me know of anything that's missing for comfortable living.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
You are the first people to stay here,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
it will be useful to you in finalising the detailed plans for your house.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We looked around with him, it was such a transformation and the layout was so interesting.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
On the ground floor was one long room with a glass door at each end,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
screened by a translucent curtain.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000
At one end there was a comfortable sitting area with a large coloured sofa bed next to a coffee table

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and a corner fireplace with a plastered chimney up to the ceiling.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
The other end of the room was a fitted kitchen with all the necessary appliances

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
as well as a small dining table cleverly fitted into an alcove.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
A vertical slice of glass gave a glimpse of a small desk and a storage area below the stairs.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000
These were off to the left of the main room and ran up past a beautifully exposed stone wall.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
There was only one room on the first floor, the bedroom,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
but there was a useful fitted wardrobe,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
interesting small windows with shutters in green stained wood to match the front door

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and best of all a door out onto a large roof terrace.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
This was a great space with plenty of stone seating,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:10.000
places to lie down, a dining table under a shady pergola made of old olive wood and thick canes for the roof.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
There was also a tap and a large old stone sink next to a barbecue area.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
There were views over the village, neighbouring gardens, the olive groves and the mountains,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
even a glimpse in the distance of the sea.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
We thought it was perfect and told Manos so.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
He was sitably modest and said it was a rushed job, achieved cheaply.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
We were not entirely convinced, there seemed good quality fittings

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
and the attention to detail in the finish, but we found this reassuring.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
The house lacked for nothing in terms of amenities.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:51.000
There were two air conditioning units, a power shower, oven, hob, washing machine, satellite TV, DVD and stereo.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
A real home from home with better weather.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
We were very impressed and grateful to Manos.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Our frustration at the slow start for our house evaporated, at least for the time being.
