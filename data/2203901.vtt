00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.960
No, then

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.280
Rahim came here with me because he finished with his girlfriend

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.120
So he came and I told him, you know

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.960
Don't get any flatter and she come and stay here because I am all alone and there are two rooms over there

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.400
You know, so you stay here you see so he said are you sure you see I said, of course

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.400
If not, then I wouldn't have told you see

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.080
So anyway, you see so he came here you see and she went with his mother her mother

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.700
How do you find being on your own is rain still with you?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.880
No, Rahim died in 21, you see

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.360
It was 9th of 21

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.680
9th of February

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.880
21 he had a massive heart attack upstairs and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.240
Then of course, you know, I heard the noises and everything

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.000
So I knocked his door, you know, and I asked him Rahim Rahim

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.120
Why you are doing this still your gym here in the room? You see, you know, what is the time?

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.040
So there was no answer then I went back in my room

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.920
Again after a little while, you know again the noise came I said

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.800
Oh, I'm going to open the door to don't see what is he up to you see when I went over there

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.160
He was fast asleep like that

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.580
The door was leaking the his back and everything that what can I do for you? You see and

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.360
he was sweating up and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.000
I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.840
just

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.700
Went and shook him up you see and I said to him rain

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.640
There's no answer. I saw my code, you know, I went quickly downstairs, you know and called paramedic

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.840
you see that time Cove it was very strongly, you know and

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.120
Paramedics came you see and

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.640
Then I called rums on from Bridgine you see

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.120
I

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.280
Made it slim then runs on came Ram's and you were the son

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.880
Ram's on is my younger son who was working in police and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.740
Of course, you know, I first I found up to paramedic, you know, then I found runs on so runs on from the way

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.280
You know, he formed up to Mab's you know, Mab's Kadi Mabai son and of course, you know, well

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.280
She

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.760
Mab's was here, you know in dark time you see but by the time runs on came paramedics

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.480
They're already here. So they couldn't see him you see or anything you see and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.920
Well, they say we have to take him to the hospital you see so I said well if you are making him better

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.280
Yeah, take him now, you see so I gave him the damn to permission to take him away

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.640
So that was quite traumatic and stressful for your son because we were in lockdown

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.360
It was kovat and he had a heart attack and then said sadly passed after that. Yeah

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.280
but when he was

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.840
Had a heart attack

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.520
Afterwards runs on girlfriend stayed with me overnight here and the next day

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.880
My brother said, you know, this is what has happened Rachel has been staying with my sister and

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.760
Rachel had kovat, you know

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.720
Very bad cold and everything and my sister said go home. You see I will be alright

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.720
There are plenty people around her

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.560
Around me so I will be alright, you know, she will be alright

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.480
So she wouldn't listen, you know, she stayed overnight with me and

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.600
Not the same day the next day, you know, I ended up into hospital with kovat. So

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.760
Yeah, this is the problem with lockdown and kovat wasn't it the best intention?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.560
So whilst your son was in hospital you were as well. Yeah, luckily you recovered and you're able

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.280
Yeah, and then very sadly

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Ramzan passed as well

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.920
Ramzan passed away within 15 days

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.760
Ramzan passed away you see

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Ramzan passed away on the

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.120
25th of February

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.760
21 and Johin went on 9th of February 21

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.040
So we didn't do what

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.160
15 days I lost two sons

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.440
But you've had such a big story isn't it?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.440
Such a big story and you're still here

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.440
I married my wife suddenly from the hospital here

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.440
Her parents should not marry the children, no

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.440
Now only the memory is with me here

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.440
Now I'm all alone, you know and there's no one

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.640
That's it, you know, but I want to stay alone

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.640
Don't want anybody near me

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.240
I think this is your independence, isn't it? And it's your strength. Yeah. Yeah, and where do you get your strength from?

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.880
From God because you are so incredibly strong

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.560
God is making me stronger and he's giving me strength

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.440
Yeah, thank you very much
