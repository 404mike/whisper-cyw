Felly oeddwch wedi'i mynd i'r Cliddart?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000

Rwy'n meddwl bod yna, 16 oed, yn oed.

Felly roeddwn i'n mynd i'r Cliddart

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
roeddwn i'n mynd i'r Cliddart.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Felly beth ysgol wedi'i ddod oedd ym mhob?

Yna roedd ym mhob yn ddod oedd ym mhob

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
a yna rwy'n mynd i'r Gellionan.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
a'r ym mhob yn ddod oedd ym mhob

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
ym mhob yn ddod oedd ym mhob.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Felly roeddwn yn ddod oedd ym mhob?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
O, oeddwn i'n ddod oedd ym mhob,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
ond roeddwn yn fawr gyda'r gyrk o Llewyr

oedd yn ddod oedd ym mhob

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
oedd yn ddod oedd ym mhob

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
i'r gyrk,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
oherwydd roeddwn wedi'i ddod oedd ym mhob

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
i'r gyrk,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
roeddwn yn ddod oedd ym mhob

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I said, what's that?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What did she say?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Oh, she said don't go into school, but go to school at the same time and come home at the same time

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and pretend you've been in school.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But I was a dirty, I had a pen, with the pen in it, the ink were, and I always had ink on my two fingers.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So you were supposed to be re-healing?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Yes, and the pen with the nib you had to change with the wooden handle.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So how did it work?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I put it in the ink then, just wrote like that then.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Always that was the traces that I had been to school.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Well, three days went by, I used to meet her and we had a penny to go to school

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and I used to go to Reese the Bakehouse then, it was a little corner grocery shop by the school,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and get a bun, and I liked oxo.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So Jess ate the oxo, and I still love it now, the fresh bread roll.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And we'd go down the park.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Which park was that?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
In Cwdda, what's the name of the park?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Pwjbach?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
No, Pwjbach.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And we went down there, and we'd be on the swings and Jess messing around all day, timed it,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
as they'd come out of school, we'd get home.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And this particular day my grandmother said to me,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Oh, there's someone inside waiting to see you.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Oh, I thought to my mother, because she could only come up once a month to see me.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And oh, she said, I've noticed these last few days Olive, your hands have been clean, there's no ink on them.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Oh, I've got to change my pen, Grandma.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Oh, well that's good.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Would you like to go and see who it is?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I went in, it was Mr Morris, the boardman.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
What's the boardman?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Well, if you didn't attend school, they'd come round to check where you were and what was wrong with you.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And so he was sitting there.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Well, hello Olive, it's nice to see you, he said, they're missing you in school.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And I couldn't say I hadn't been to school, because it would be telling a lie.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And I know I'd be punished with my grandmother.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I wasn't hit, never had to hit me, but I wasn't allowed out for a week.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I was allowed to sit in the window and watch all my friends play, but I wasn't allowed out.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Of course he questioned me why I hadn't been to school, and I'd done the wrong thing by saying that,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
well, if Thomas can mitch school, well I can.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Well, I've dealt with Thomas for a few times now, he said, and I don't like you befriending her with her habits.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
She was a lovely girl. She never mitched after.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Because her parents didn't know anything about it. Her sister covered for her every time.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And so from then on I had ink on my fingers.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Because my grandmother took me to school every day, stood in lines with me,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and embarrassed me by taking me in the class and sitting with me until the teacher came and then redished her.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And met me coming home from school, coming out of school.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So I learnt my lesson. Three days out of my life I mitched school. Beth, I did love school.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And you talked about the pens, so what was the desk like?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Much nicer than what they were now. I mean, you sat at a desk, individual desk we had,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and the inkwell was on the top. You could lift the top to put your books in and whatever you had.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And then the inkwell was usually on the right hand side.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Was the seats connected to the front?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
No, no. They were in two bits, the ones we had.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Were they single desks?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
A chair and single desks, yes.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Islwyn, you were in school when war broke out. Can you tell me a little bit about what it was like?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
War broke out in September 1939 and I was seven years of age.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I was in the Cliddwchd Junior School.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Well, after a few days there was talk of the war breaking out and the next thing we knew we were marching down street to the Pegen Office in Brook Street,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
which is the Old and Unemployment Office, is where the new chapel now is built in Brook Street.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So, Gaby, you had daily gas mask drill while you were in school. Can you tell me a bit about that?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
As soon as the war started we had these gas masks and every day then we were taught drills.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:41.000
One of the drills was that the teacher would drill the whistle and they'd put your gas mask on and the next part then you'd dive underneath the desks.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
The hands flat out underneath the drill. That was a drill.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Now you'd get that for about two or three weeks until we knew that once that whistle went it was very important that we had to lie down, everybody, in the class.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:06.000
But if it happened in the school yard in the junior school we'd either have to lie down on the floors we were taught or if you had time you'd run underneath the shelter.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And the girls up the top end of the school then would open the gate and all run down, which had happened not very often in the day, so two or three times.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
You were issued with a gas mask and I gather you had to be taught how to...

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Oh yeah, the orders came now. We all go up to the school and the centre they would issue the gas masks in the school, adults and children.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And my mother took me up, about ten I was, you know.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Everybody now trying, this gas mask on and you couldn't see the face, you didn't know who was by your side, you know.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And you could, boom, boom, boom, noise, you couldn't talk. Everybody was fitted with a gas mask anyway.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And then you had to take it to school every day. First of all it came in a cardboard box, well that didn't last a week.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And then you had tin canisters and my mother bought me a tin canister and he put the gas mask in there, you know.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And it lasted then. Everybody had a gas mask, the whole nation had a gas mask, that must have caused something, you know.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I went to Cliddock Infant School and I went to Cliddock Junior School.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And my memory for me is going swimming in the Hope and Air Palace where Danny, if he didn't go in, he stuck this rope around you and he just tucked you in.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
St. Goswin.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And I can remember in the Cliddock Infant School there was a Welsh stream.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I think his name was Mamie Williams taught them all.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And every one of those children who was taught in the Welsh stream passed this scholarship to go to St. Limerro Grammar.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And so she was a wonderful teacher, apparently. I was in Cliddock Junior School at the stream.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And my main thing to remember is that I sat next to Derek Begburn, the International.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I was going to school in St. Joseph's Convent.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Thinking that today it's Monner Park, the staircase, I thought it was enormous when I used to go up on my birthday to the Reverend Mother and we'd have a sweet and lonely picture, you know.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
It was a wonderful thing to do.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I remember the first time the first person, one of the nuns, Sister Camilla's, and she came in and I was going up the stairs, because we had to dust the stairs sometimes with the carpets for the stairs.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And it was my turn probably to do that. And she came in and she took her habit off and nobody ever saw a nun without her hair, you know.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And she threw it in the air and she said, I passed my driving test.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Yippee! And she said, Mary Davies, you didn't see that. You didn't see that!

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And I think of a fella coming back many years ago and he was a boarder there in the 50s with myself and he said, where's my sister Margaret Treaser?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And she was in bed so he went in to see her. She said, what you doing now?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:09.000
He said, I'm a bodyguard. And she said, who are you a bodyguard for? He said, I'm a bodyguard to Madonna. He was Madonna's bodyguard.
