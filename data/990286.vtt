00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760
Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor had been at the film studios where Elizabeth was finishing off a movie.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.720
And of course nobody, nobody really knew what St. David's Day was, and they were all excited about finishing the movie.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.040
So Richard was sort of taking a back seat, and he was a little bit unhappy, but he went along with the excitement, and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.400
the studio crew wanted to take Elizabeth out for lunch because apparently she was very easy to work with and they all liked it, so they had a good time.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.600
And eventually they all ended up back at Richard's house in London, and the biographer, author of the book, was there.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.960
And they had a few drinks, and finally Elizabeth went to bed, and Richard was left with the biographers.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:05.360
And they were talking, and Richard put on a tape recording of Milkwood where he was actually reading one of the parts, and they sat and listened to it.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.480
And things got very quiet, and Richard was feeling someone to hear right.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.680
And I'd like to read you what happened.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:30.080
Dylan Thomas of the Wild Welsh Genius had originally written that inspired narration for the tympanic resonance and tremulous sweetness of Richard's tongue.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.000
And now great waves of nostalgia swept over the richest and most famous son of Wales.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.520
He looked gruelingly into his tall vodka glass. His mind was back in the valleys, back in the far removed world of his childhood.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.360
There's nobody like us, I tell you. And by the way, you haven't included in the book that story about my father.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.240
Beautiful he was, sitting outside the miner's arms on a Saturday night.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.800
After he'd had a few jars, he would fix his stupendously stoned eyes on his fellow miners and say in Welsh,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.280
Poisin vel nid. And they would answer, nid.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.440
Poisin vel nid.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.880
Who is like us? Nobody.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.520
Who is like me? Nobody.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480
Welsh Love Letter

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.800
Were all the peaks of Gwynedd in one huge mountain pile,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.680
nixed on Moelhoin,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.640
Moeliget, Moelhebog, and Eddory on top and all between us, I climbed them, climbed them all to reach you.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.440
Oh how I love you.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.520
Were all the streams of Gwynedd in one huge great river join, Goyfaw, Goyleed,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.040
Glastlin, Argyn, and Mawddech in flood and all between us, I'd swim them, swim them all to reach you.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.600
Oh how I love you.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.120
Were all the forts of Gwynedd in one great fortless link,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.080
Cairn and Castle, Criciath and Cardlech,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.440
Connoy and Caernarfon, and its flames,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.160
I jumped them, jumped them all to reach you. Oh how I love you.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.520
See you Saturday if it's not raining.
