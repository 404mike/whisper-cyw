00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, Fandednu, and as part of the Longest

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.320
Yarn I'm collecting memories.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.200
So I'm with John today who is going to talk about his mother and his father who are both

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.800
the veterans of the Second World War.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.800
So John, over to you.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.440
Do you want to talk about yourâ€¦

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.880
My parents, they were born in the early 20s, so at the time the war broke out, my father

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.920
would have just left school, my mother was still at school.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.880
My father went into medical school and spent much of the war in medical school.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:46.280
He described one incident where a V1 doodle bug landed not far from the hospital he was

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.520
working in and he described how he was blown from one end of the corridor right the way

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.240
down to the other and then back again as the sort of the vacuum sucked them back in

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.600
again.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.200
Both my parents would describe the fear of hearing these things coming over and when

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.040
the engine cut out they'd know that it was going to come and fall somewhere and they

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.400
just hoped and prayed it wouldn't be there and it wouldn't be where they were.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.240
Mercifully it wasn't.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.000
He qualified, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the rest of the war in Palestine

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.440
as an army captain, as a medical officer to I forget which regiment and then went back

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.040
into civilian life at the end of the war.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.400
My mother, once she'd finished school, enlisted in the Rennes and ended up in the code-breaking

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.560
Bletchley Rennes, even though she was one of their outposts in Stanmore in northwest

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.720
London, she like many people refused to talk about it for the whole time, the whole 30

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.600
years stipulated by the Official Secrets Act and even then I think her father guessed what

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.160
she was doing, one or two and she was quite cross about that.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:12.600
She spent much of her time working on the bombs, operating these decoding devices and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.320
again telling us how Churchill's orders at the end of the war, well they were all dismantled

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.200
and so that was my parents' memories of the war.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.160
So tell me, did your mother do anything with the knowledge that she'd got in terms of

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.560
working with computers or accounts or anything, did she go back to work?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.480
She went back to work, she went back into hospital work as a radiographer in those days

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.200
I think because computers were in there almost pre-infancy, even when I was a student in

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.040
the 70s, a computer took up a whole room and it would take two hours to do something you

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.920
could do on a pocket calculator in a split second nowadays but that's such was life.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.760
She became a radiographer, never really got her mind around a computer in the whole of

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.400
a life though she did become a GP practice manager at one stage once we'd all grown

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.160
up and I think she had to learn how to work the office computer.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.200
She was just one of the technicians who sort of fed the stuff into the bombs, pushed the

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.440
button.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.160
That was also quite complicated though.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.160
Oh they were, yes.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
That wasn't an easy job.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.000
No I don't suppose it was.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.200
She never talked about it, even then never talked about it that much.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.720
When we took her back to Bletchley when they opened it as a museum, the mock-up bomb that

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.040
they had was obviously realistic enough because she took one look at it and recognised it

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.040
immediately.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.600
This is when she was in her early 90s.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.240
Oh they're lovely memories, thank you so much.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.240
My pleasure.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.120
Thank you for speaking to me, I appreciate it.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.640
Thanks very much.
