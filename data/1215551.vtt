You're listening to Victoria sharing how she keeps in touch with friends after leaving her hometown.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.120
Some of which luckily I'm still in touch with but others that perhaps, you know, they've moved on in life and perhaps don't recognise me.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.680
So, you know, the changes get older.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.520
So how did you reconnect with those people?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:28.640
Mostly through contacts like text, social media, mostly social media but texting as well.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.480
Family contacts as well because obviously my family have contact with their parents and so on.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.680
So it's like, yeah.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.680
When I was, when I moved from Somerset they became friends when I was at Playgroup with Becky and her sister.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.920
Ah, okay. So they weren't friends before anyway, they were mums who made friends.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.040
Mums who made friends with each other whilst Becky and I were at play school.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.160
Yeah.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.600
And that's kind of...

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.240
Kind of bringing a friendship because I've got to know her mum as well so it's kind of...

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.200
And made it easier to stay in touch.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.920
Communicate and I'm still in touch with her mum now.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.880
So if we lived in a world where we didn't have social media...

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.520
It would be difficult unless I had mobile which I do so, you know, I do have mobile contact as well.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.920
I'm not purely just social media, it's just social media I find it easy to communicate through.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.120
Yeah, it's instant, isn't it?

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.120
Instant saving, you can say, you know, they're sat near there and they'll get it instantly.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.400
But you might be one of the more lucky ones who still had a contact.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.200
So that you could kind of pick up and try and get in touch with people.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.360
Yeah, re-establish it.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.920
Yeah.
