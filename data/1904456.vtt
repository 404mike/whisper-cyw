00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520
Today is August 15th 2019 and I'm here in the beautiful Nantgull Church having a chat

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:18.400
with Mr Michael Morgan originally from these parts but now living in Surrey. Mike welcome

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.640
to the church and thanks for agreeing to have a little bit of a chat. Mike tell me where

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.080
are you from originally? I know it's these parts somewhere. A farm called Lower Ochekeven,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:41.560
from Typhoon. Right and what sort of farm was that? Part arable, part hill I suppose you might

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.560
call it. So you had the best of both worlds really? Yes. Can you remember anything in particular

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.480
about the people who lived in that area about any of the characters who you know passed by?

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:05.280
I remember some old gentleman that lived at the Upper Ochekeven, I made because it was lower,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.000
middle and upper so he may have been at Middle Ochekeven. We were certainly at Lower Ochekeven

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.320
and he used to be, you could set your club by him, he'd be walking coming into town on a Wednesday

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.120
on his pony at one o'clock he'd pass by the house. So you could virtually set your watch by him.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:33.520
Oh yes. A gentleman of regular habits. Yes, very elderly gentleman, often wondered who he was and

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.360
what his family was. Yes it would be interesting to find out. And what was life on the farm like?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.400
Were you busy? Were you kept busy all the time? It was very basic, there was no electricity,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:54.400
coal fired, heating, part of the chimney. Sort of things we take for granted today then weren't

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.760
really around. Yes. And what about schooling then Mike, primary school, secondary school,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.520
do you have any memories fond or otherwise? I come to school and then on up to

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:17.200
Raleigh School and then up to Binturion School, secondary modern. And can you remember your teachers in the primary school?

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:25.520
No I can't, I've lost track of them in my mind. Well obviously one... In fact until I get to Binturion,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:35.040
secondary modern, I can't remember much of it. I'm afraid it was a bit of a dance. Oh go on, I'm sure you made up for it in other ways.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.360
And well it turns out that when you went to Binturion, my father was one of your teachers

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.360
and I believe he taught you woodwork Mike, so have you still got any memories of anything you made or anything you did?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.360
I can remember him chasing me around the woodwork room with a chair leg. Oh dear, had you fashioned the chair leg?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.960
And oh several things I've got at home still, there's a little news today that I learnt under your father's tutelage.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.960
Well that's wonderful, so something good came out of all that. Yes, I enjoyed my time there.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:21.920
Yes, what about social life, friends, things to do in the evening? There was the YMCA in town

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.480
and of course once one got old enough you crept round the back of the pub for a pint.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.480
Yes, I think we all did a little bit of that. Now you found... It was then known as the butcher's arms.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.480
The Kondyther arms, no, no, it's called the horseshoe now isn't it?

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.480
Round the back road there. Yes, yes I think I know the one you mean.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.040
Your ancestors came from Dolvolle which of course is one of the farms under the water now.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:01.040
Can you remember anything about those people and where they came from, their names etc.?

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.040
I believe they came to live there originally from Camastwith area.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.600
I know that there's a churchyard near Camastwith that's got a heck of a lot of Morgans' names on the stones.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:25.600
What I'd tip it I learnt from when I was a lad confirms itself that they did all come from Camastwith originally

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.600
but I don't know any of their history or anything.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:40.160
So and there was a connection with the Lewis Lloyds with the land that they were on over there I believe.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:50.160
So they came when they... one of the family of the Lewis Lloyds ended up living in Red at the Nile Hall

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.720
and from that some of the family came down to live here at Dolvolle.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.720
To live and farm at Dolvolle, yes.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.720
Your cousin of course is Mary, Mary Morgan as she was now, Mary Connolly.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:18.720
I think you're telling me about her, was it her grandmother who came from somewhere in England to be working in service?

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.280
Yes, as I understand it when the family lived at Dolvolle

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.280
would have been my great uncle, I could even be further back than that perhaps.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:41.280
One of them started to go out and was courting a girl who lived at the big house down the road at Nankwip.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.840
And eventually they got married and that's how I came to be.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.840
Yes, sort of one of your very important ancestors.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.840
So I'm part English through that as well.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.840
Part English as well.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.840
Well you've certainly got connections with English people and with the Welsh aristocracy I suppose.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.840
We could refer to the Lewis Lloyds couldn't we?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.400
I think they were just tenant farmers, you know, as they were over there when they came here too.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.400
I see, they seemed to own vast tracts of land.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.400
They did, yes.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.400
That's fine and then you presumably moved away to work, did you?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.400
I joined the army.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.960
I joined the army and what can I add, I went to Aldershot, page 90.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.960
I spent seven months training to be a paratrooper.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.960
And was immediately posted overseas to the campaign that was going on at the time in Borneo

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:56.960
where there was a confrontation between Indonesia and British territory.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:07.520
I spent nine months there, came back and was involved in perhaps three or four more

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.520
in places around the world, the Middle East.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.520
Right, so you've really had quite a chequered career haven't you?

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.520
And you say you try and come back about every couple of years.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.520
Is that right?

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.520
No, you come back about twice a year?

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.080
I like to come home two or three times a year.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.080
Two or three times a year, oh right, even better, yes.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.080
Where you've tried to follow up some of your family I believe.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:40.080
Well in recent years I've become more interested, I suppose as one does when you get older.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.080
Yes, well that's, you know, it's something I think people are doing now, isn't it?

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.080
You know, we're really trying to follow up our family trees.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.640
And have you had any success in finding them and following them up?

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.640
I know you said something about looking in graves.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:08.640
Yes, I've been trying to look for any of the family that might have died up the valley.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.640
That might have been buried up the chapel that is now under water.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.200
And I can't seem to find any trace of the graves or anything like that,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.200
whether they've been reinterred or not.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.200
Yes, that would be interesting to find out.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.200
Right, well look, thank you very, very much for your time, Mike.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:39.200
It's been great talking to you and it's been great talking to somebody who can trace their ancestry back to,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.760
well, a spot just up from where we're sitting at the moment in this lovely Nantleville church.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.760
So thank you very much for your contribution.
