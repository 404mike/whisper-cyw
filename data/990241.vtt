00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And her songs, they just rolled out across this lake.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And there was something about this lake that she got to get to by going now into a farm of roads with all these gates and stuff.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They're sort of encapsulated for her what truly held a part of her heart in Wales.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And after all this time, I'm going to come up with about a two minute poem, but anyway, that's the whole story behind it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The pocket of peace in a maddened world, amid folds of worn green, great gaps of film it extends from day to day.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
All in a moment, the scene rises in white, and the blooms in green, then from day to day, gives her cool refreshments.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Her perpetual gifts.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Uh oh.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Anyway, songs spawned a fisherman rolled out across her, tone gives birth to tone, unrehearsed creations born of stillness.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Close gently the gates, so when time and distance grows large between you and Cwmdeus, the vision of that fragile moment can remain to become a symbol of your genesis.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Sorry I missed that.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
...and especially for tonight.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's called the North American Northamallan, but it's really meant to be Seattle's first Northamallan in many, many years.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And it's a vision of what I had for tonight, and the vision was born mostly of Northamallans that I've known in Vancouver.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And there's one character in particular, called the Dark-eyed Melissa with sparrot tone in here, and most of you will recognize Alan Jones from Vancouver.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And of course, we have two sisters, the Alton and Soprano over there, the Wingate sisters.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And we also have somebody who left his wealthness like an undervalued trinket among old buttons in a drawer, and that's Phil Humphreys.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And you might recognize other people in here, but there's nothing crude, rude, or unrefined.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
One man stands to welcome his old friends and strangers look for comfortable places.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
He calls out, inviting all to sing, voices join, weak and unblended.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Then a glass is raised, a sip, a smile, a word exchanged, and a song finds its pride, filling itself with mountain and valley, and a hush, brooding beauty.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It plays itself against itself in an age-old game, running from pure heart to mountain sides full of wildly colored goats.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The thought turns boiling over and dieboxes the soldier faster and faster than some speed, almost outside of itself until it settles into the comfort of a well-worn hymn.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Out of that billowing blended sound comes silence, followed by a story of, I remember what I remember when I was a little boy.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Then a dark-lipped, malithluous baritone resurrects the boyhood of that wild, word-worshipping welshman who captured each right and smell and sound,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that left a heart within us all and made us each king of our own little apple towns.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Dylan's boywood vanishes in a new dance of flute and fiddle, strings and wind.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Two sisters follow, a lyric teased between also and soprano.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So one by one, each comes to offer a talent to the whole.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Some timid, some easy, and some who until this night have left their welshness like an undervalued trinket among old buttons in a drawer.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
They bring up their awkward offering until there is no more.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Then those who are hungry eat, the thirsty drink and the tired go home to sleep, while the unsatisfied nest against the piano to sing.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Of mountain and valley, shadow and light, of loving and dying and anxiety and flight, of mothers and fathers and time beyond time,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
passionate spirits, tempered in righteousness, carry three winters and blankets of faith.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Tonight each has been a giver, each a taker.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Happy this night for the love of that ancient land.
