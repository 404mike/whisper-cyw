00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200
Good evening.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.280
Could you start by telling me your name, where you were born and when you were born?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.360
My name is Rupert Minto.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.040
My two middle names, I just put RRL.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.040
I was born in Jamaica, St. Anne's, Brownstone.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.040
I lived there until I was 15.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.040
My mum lived when I was about 13 years old, to come to England.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.040
We split up with my dad.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.040
So after the splitting up, I will live with my uncle and his family.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.040
Until I come, when mum sent for me at the age of 15.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:02.040
I arrived in England in 1967, the 22nd of September.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.040
And we lived in Birmingham, in Erdington.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.040
A place called Erdington, one of the boroughs called Erdington.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.040
And I lived there for a good while actually.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:23.040
And then we moved to something called Field, which is, that comes down to Four Oaks at the time.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.040
I lived there for about 7 years, 7-8 years.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.040
I even got married there, my first wife.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.040
And then we had two children.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040
I moved out and then we had two children.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.040
And yeah, we had two children.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.040
And then later on I moved into my own flat.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.040
And then we had the third.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.040
And then we, you know, we bought a house.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.040
Me and my first wife.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.040
That fell through after about 9 years.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.040
And then I lived on my own field like a while.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.040
I rented, you know, I rented accommodations.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.040
And then one, you know, I went to work one morning because I'm a qualified tool maker engineer.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.040
And I was working in this company.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:35.040
And we had, we used to make even gasket for McLaren motor cars.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.040
And I was on good money.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.040
But I went in one morning and the gaffer comes up when he owns the company.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.040
And he ordered three brand spanking, top of the range, rain rovers.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.040
One for him, one for his wife and one for his son.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.040
And then he had the cheek to come on the shop floor and said,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.040
Sorry, I can't give you a rise this year because the government says so.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.040
I said, you what?

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.040
He said, no, I can't give you a rise.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.040
I said, well, if you can't give me a rise, my friend.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.040
I said, well, what about give us some bonus and oh, I can't do that either.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.040
I said, well, fair enough. Thank you very much.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040
I said, you got a week's notice.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.040
Oh, you say you can't do that. I said, oh, yes, I can.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.040
He was the only tool maker in the place.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.040
I mean, you know, when you talk of tools,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.040
I'm making tools bigger than the television in there and smaller than that cup here.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.040
Massive.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.040
So, you know, when I make big tools, the lorry comes for them, take it up to the place.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.040
And then the next day I drive up there because they actually, I have my own car,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.040
but they actually bought me a van.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.040
Company bought me a brand new van and every three years they changed it.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.040
And I keep that van 24 sevens.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.040
So I got my car park up on the van.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.040
And I went in and I said, right, I'm not working for the Simon Eager.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.040
I said, either you do something or I'm off.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.040
And he thought I was bluffing.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.040
So I got week notice that lasts for three months.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.040
And he thought I would stop there because there was some jobs I have to finish off myself.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.040
And then after three months, I packed my tools, take them home in the van,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.040
take everything home and bring the van back the morning and say, ta-da, gone.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.040
So after a while, I said, my daughter then, my youngest daughter,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.040
at that time I had three daughters.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.040
And she had a flat and she was in a little bit of trouble with it.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.040
So I said, two bedroom flat.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.040
So I said, I'm moving with you and sort you out and then I'll go.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.040
So I done that for about eight months, put her on top.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.040
So I said, no, you can manage now.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.040
So you know Jim down there, you still live down there.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.040
I found him for the two first cousins.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.040
I said to him, I said, right, I want to come down for a couple of weeks.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.040
And a couple of weeks, probably about 20 years.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.040
I found we bought this house, me and Val.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.040
We live here for 14 years.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.040
So I live with Jim for about a couple of years.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.040
Then I live with Bassett for about four years.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.040
Then we moved and bought this house.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.040
So that's about it.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.040
So you know, when I come down here, the first job I went to,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.040
he said, when can you start?

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.040
I said, have I got a job then?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.040
He said, skill like yours, we've been looking for it.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.040
So I started and it's a place in Cumbrian,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.040
you've got airplanes, you know, you can't tow seatings at the time.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.040
And then he got me a job.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.040
I think at the moment, you've got Saffron.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.040
I worked there for, ooh.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.040
That's the only place I worked then, yeah.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.040
So we live here 14 years.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.040
Bassett, probably about four.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.040
And I got a job when I lived with Jim, so four and four.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.040
I worked there for about a year.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.040
And then I moved to the next place.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.040
I got a job when I lived with Jim, so four and four.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:38.040
I worked there for, right up from about, I can't tell you the year.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.040
I can't remember the year when I started there.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.040
But I worked there for about at least 16, 17 years.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.040
I worked there.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.040
And then after I retired, I said, that's it.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.040
I done six months over.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.040
I said, I'm going to do 12 months.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.040
And then we went on holiday and come back.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.040
And there was a letter from my doctor, which is then going around there.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.040
At least very surgery.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.040
And he says, I have to come in the office.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.040
So we were going, he said, oh, we're calling for a flu job.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.040
So I said, I never take it in my life.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.040
So why should I take it now?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.040
So he said, well, since we got it, might as well take it.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.040
We want another one.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.040
I said, no, I don't want it.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.040
And they actually talked me into it.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.040
So I took the flu job the Friday and Saturday morning I get up with Gout.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.040
And that's how I decided to pack up work there.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.040
He said, I could move.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.040
And I never feel pain like that in my life.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.040
So that's it.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.040
They just packed up.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:58.040
And then a few of the next, I think two girls from the office came down here to see me because I couldn't move.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:06.040
And they said, right, we can give it, you know, see if it works.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:12.040
And they said, I don't know when I'll be any better to come back to work.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.040
She said, well, we come down here to give you an option.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.040
You can have redundants with full paid.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.040
I said, well, that's fair enough.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.040
So I took that.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.040
But, you know, I mean, I still go up there sometimes and see the lads and have a chat with them.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:38.040
But apart from that, I meet a lot of people down here, different function and things like that.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.040
That's how I meet your dad, your granddad.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:50.040
And we met and then, you know, both of us, we just get it off just like that.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.040
And they were chatting, talking, saying, if he goes, then he's going out anyway.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:02.040
And sometimes I don't know if he tells you, but sometimes we phone up each other and say, what are you doing?

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.040
And he said, nothing much.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.040
I said, OK, then shall we have tea or lunch or something like that?

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.040
Most of the time we go to Tesco and Cardiff Road.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:17.040
We go in there, if I choose, you know, I mean, I drive up there, park in Tesco's car park.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.040
And then we go in Tesco and we have lunch and sit there and have a good chat.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.040
And then I took him home and drive him home.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.040
So everywhere we go, he said, I'll take a taxi.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.040
I said, no, I'll drive you home.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:39.040
What do you remember about your childhood in the Caribbean, growing up in the Caribbean?

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.040
Oh, fun.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.040
And lots of it.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.040
We used to have different seasons where we have different games.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:55.040
Sometimes, you know, I mean, I can't tell you what season it is, but I know it's in the summer.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.040
You have like kite where you make your own kite and sail it in the air.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:10.040
What we used to do as lads, we used to get razor blade and we get like a piece of bamboo, split it,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:17.040
and then put the razor blade in to push one side of the razor blade in there and tie the razor blade.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.040
You know, you know, where the razor blade comes in.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.040
Tie it around with strings and then put it on your kite string.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.040
You know, they call it the tie like they call it.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.040
The tail of the kite, not the string was standing up, the tail of it.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.040
The tail, so to keep the kite balanced in the air.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:41.040
And we used to go kite hunting, you know, go sailing up like I live down, we call down there, Lincoln.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:47.040
I used to go take the kite up to Summer Hill to sail with the razor blade and it, you see.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:53.040
So when all the kites came out, we put a short list on our kite, a short string on our kite.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.040
So it wouldn't go too far and then pull it up against the head and then when the tail comes up,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:05.040
the razor blade would slip the cord and we have men over there, boys over there, side.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.040
We give them back the kite, but we keep the cord.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:18.040
At the end of the season, I probably have a bowl, you know, made about that long and about that long.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.040
But it's not just us doing it.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.040
They do it to somebody else, somewhere else.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:35.040
It's all over the district, all over the island, all over the parish, you know, different things.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:41.040
But we all make a joke of it and then at the end of it, we laugh and say, who's got the biggest bong?

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:53.040
We have fun, then we have to have, you know, you're a world of geek, you're a world of geek.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.040
We don't buy a geek over there, we make our own.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:03.040
We used to make it from cotton tree or guava tree or pimento, which is tough wood.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.040
So you know what I mean?

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.040
So you make a gig and you make for yourself, you make a tiny little one.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:20.040
And then they'll make big ones and then you say, right, you know, we used to put the gig there, head up.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.040
So you got to put the sprite there and then the gig on top there.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.040
And we used to take spot shot at the gig, you know what I mean?

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.040
You have to really hold them and see how close you can get.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:40.040
But the idea is to get it onto the gig and to cause damage.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.040
And the one that causes the most damage is the winner.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.040
So when you have a little gig like that, you know what I mean?

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:53.040
You can cause a lot of damage with it because the big gig, when they come after it, they always miss.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.040
You know what I mean?

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.040
Either too close or not close enough.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.040
They never really get the target.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:05.040
But with a small gig, you can hit the target because there's a big and it's only small.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.040
That's always, you know, we do that.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.040
We used to have animals as well.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.040
And I used to have a bull cow.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.040
You know what I mean?

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.040
Massive he was.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.040
But I never tied him.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:30.040
In the evening, I tied him and I took him out in the morning to feed.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:35.040
But when you pick him up in the evening, I come in and just let him there.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.040
I never tied him.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.040
He wouldn't go anywhere.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.040
He wouldn't strike.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.040
He knows where his boundaries.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.040
And that's it.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.040
I used to have goats as well.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.040
Actually, I have four goats.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.040
And same with them.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.040
They take them out and you know what I mean?

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:04.040
We got about, I'll leave with my uncle after my mom come to England before I come here.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.040
And we are probably about 15 acres of land.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.040
And then it's all wired around.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.040
The land is all wired around.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.040
It's back wired.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.040
So there's no need to tie them up.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.040
Only when you take them out in the morning, you know, you take them out so they can feed in one place.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.040
You tie them so when you go back in the evening, you know where they are.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.040
You see they have to run around looking for them.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.040
You know where they are.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:40.040
And my school days, we got good fun out there, man.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.040
Really good fun.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:49.040
The difference what I find when I come to England is the classrooms.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.040
It's completely different.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.040
In Jamaica, you are one teacher teaching probably about 90 kids.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:04.040
And you know, they got them in three groups like A, B and C.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.040
See like, if you're bright, you in A.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.040
If you're less bright, you in B.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.040
But if you a bit awkward, you in C.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.040
And that's how they teach you.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.040
And there's one teacher.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.040
See they'll move from one class to another.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.040
You got that one teacher for 12 months.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:32.040
See if you don't pass your exams, you're there another 12 months.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.040
You're there another 12 months.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.040
With the same teacher.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.040
But I think the longest I have stayed in one class is probably about nine months.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:49.040
Because so far, you know what I mean, I was always a brilliant reader.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:57.040
But when it comes to maths and history and things like that, I wasn't as strong a reader as the rest.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.040
I take more time to study.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:06.040
And I make sure I can, I could study a book and then I could recite it afterwards.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:14.040
And that's what I, you know what I mean, that's how I stick to what I do and all my exams.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.040
I do the same thing.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:24.040
I passed to go to high school, but I, you know what I mean, my dad wouldn't contribute to it too much.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.040
I said, no, leave it.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.040
I stick with the old school I goes to.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:36.040
And then I about the age of four, coming up to 14, face a person, you know, they kick you out of school at 15 and a half.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.040
Age of 14, I said I had enough of this.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.040
So I went and worked with my uncle until I leave there and come to England.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.040
So I worked as a carpenter.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.040
I worked as a plasterer.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:59.040
Well, when I said plaster in Jamaica, bricklaying and plaster is the same trade.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.040
Because you do the bricklaying and then you come back and you do the plastering.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.040
You don't do like bricklaying and somebody else do the plastering.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.040
You do it yourself.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.040
You do the whole complete thing.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.040
What do you remember about the discipline in the households back in Jamaica?

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.040
Oh, there was discipline, all right.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:30.040
You see, what I remember about that, the older one disciplined the younger ones.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:42.040
So if you was a dad, like, you know, he was 10 years old, 12 years old, would discipline you.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.040
And then a 14 year old would discipline him and his stages.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.040
So the old, as I said, I didn't live with my dad after my mom's life.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.040
But there I live with my uncle.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.040
But my uncle, he never ever whipped me, not my auntie.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.040
Never whipped me.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.040
Never beat me.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.040
I don't do anything to do with whipping.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:14.040
If there was nothing there, you would have a big oven and it was wood fired, so it was dry wood.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040
And there was none.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:26.040
I just go up the hill because I ain't got to go far from the hill because the house we built is right underneath a hillside.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.040
You just climb up there and there's always dry tree up there.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.040
You cut down a few and roll it down.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.040
And you just roll down.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.040
And then we also have this great big cast iron stove.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.040
And you put the wood in one side of it and light it and then you have six burners on the top.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.040
So you can cook six pots at the same time.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.040
It was fun.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.040
And I got my own bedroom.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:03.040
My bedroom was the only one in there with flooring, wood flooring.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.040
And then I wouldn't let nobody clean my bedroom.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.040
I have to clean it myself.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.040
I like to see when it's clean and shine.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:21.040
And I mean, and it's got wardrobe and a dressing table in there and one chair so I can do my own work.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.040
It was fun.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:36.040
I thought there was about 14 of us living in the house because the house was about 16 apartments, massive house.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.040
My uncle was a building contractor so he built his own house.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:50.040
And he, one of the rooms he built, there was a tank underneath the room and then the room built on top.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:59.040
So, like in the drought, that day there was a reserve to go through.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.040
So we always have water.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:13.040
And everybody, you know, all the boys could drive at the age of probably about 10 years, 10, 12 years old.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.040
And we used to take it in terms.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:23.040
We used to have like this big stone crusher just down the bottom.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:34.040
My uncle owns half and, well, the Charlie's, the Chairman Charlie's is a big man, white man.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.040
And he had his store in Brownstone.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.040
And then he owns the other half of the stone crusher.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.040
So they owned the crusher between us.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:55.040
So as boy pitney, we used to rush home and we used to have two vans to pick up a ton and a quarter and a ton and a half.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.040
And he's the first one who reached home in charge of that one.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.040
I was driving since I was 12 years old, I'm young.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.040
Drawing stone.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.040
Man, you got more blocks than stones.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:19.040
But every trip you make, to we didn't have no, and you know, you could, you know, it's a big property.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:30.040
People used to gather the stones out, dig stones, and we'd draw it for the, you know, so we'd just write down how many stones, you know, how many loads of stones we'd draw from him.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.040
So each load of stone the van picked up, they'd get ten shillings.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.040
And they guarantee all the ten shillings, they'd give me one.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.040
So anyone being kind to me, I'd bring their stone more.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:55.040
So, you know, when you get my old man, my old man, I used to see him.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:01.040
And he used to give my auntie some money and give me a pound, my pocket money.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.040
And in them days my friend, that's it.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.040
I never ask if your books know anything because I used to save that money.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:15.040
I spent some, but I saved some, and all the books I want I buy.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.040
So I don't have to give them away to anybody else.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:24.040
Because sometimes, you know, you're doing lessons, you need them books to fall back on.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.040
And so if you give them away, you got nothing, you know what I mean?

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.040
But you know, in Jamaica it was real nice, man.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:38.040
But mango time, orange time, growing over, coconut.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.040
They had seen the boys at home, my friend.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.040
We'd gone out to forage for ourselves, you know what I mean?

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.040
We carried things home.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.040
We carried things home, but especially in the school all the day, you know what I mean?

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:05.040
Like, summer we used to get six weeks summer, Christmas four weeks, Easter two weeks.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.040
And they had days now and again.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:16.040
Once the boys do what they're supposed to do at home, nobody bothers you.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.040
The time was yours, if you know what I mean.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
Nobody bothers you.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:29.040
But when I come, you know what I mean, then I come to England, 1967.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:37.040
I leave the, the September the 21st and I land there the 22nd.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:46.040
When I come here, the first thing I seen was all these houses across the, you know what I mean?

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.040
And smoke was coming up through the chimney.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:24:03.040
And I remember saying to ma'am, I said, when she picked me up at Eadrow, it wasn't Gatwick, it was Eadrow.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.040
She picked me up at Eadrow.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.040
And he coming up, I said, ma'am, I said, it won't take long to get a job over here, innit?

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.040
She said, why?

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.040
I said, all these bakeries they got over here.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.040
For the only thing we see in Jamaica with a chimney is a bakery.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.040
Nothing more.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.040
No, why you see they got chimneys out there?

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.040
Because you don't need it.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:32.040
And she said, son, I wanted, I don't want to disappoint you too much.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.040
But that's not a bakery, that's a house.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:41.040
I said, you mean to tell me you take me away from where I got to bring me to a bakery?

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.040
And she said, you'll find out when you go home.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.040
Anyway, we go home.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.040
And she said, well, that's your room in there.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.040
It was a nice room.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040
Good-sized room.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.040
Probably about the size of the third bedroom and the size here.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.040
But you could get a double bed in there and a wardrobe.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.040
And she said, ah.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.040
And then, you know what I mean, that was September.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.040
I go back to school.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.040
A week at home and then I was back in school in Nietzsche Secondary.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.040
And I spent, oh, 12 months.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.040
And then time to go to work.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:38.040
But before all that comes, I think it was September, October, it started to snow.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.040
And I'd never seen snow before.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.040
I read of snow.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.040
I'd seen it in a book.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.040
You know what I mean?

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.040
All the, I was all there looking.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.040
And these flakes, and I said, son, mama, I said, all you need now is some syrup.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:06.040
In Jamaica, what we do, they do the big block of ice and it's like a shaver.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.040
I said, shave the ice.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.040
And you knock it out.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.040
I said, it's rammed.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.040
Shave it and knock it and shave it and knock it.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:21.040
Then you take it out, slide it out and slide it in a cup and pour syrup all over it.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.040
And that was the, you know, the trepons, which is half a tanner.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.040
I said, all you need now, mama, is some syrup.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.040
She said, you can't eat that.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.040
She said, come out.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.040
You have a chill blade.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.040
I said, what's that?

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.040
I said, this is fun.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.040
I even lay down in the rolling in the snow.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.040
I tell the man, I had a chill blade, my friend.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.040
I screamed.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.040
I never feel pain like that in my life.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.040
I said, I want to go home.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.040
I want to go home.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:08.040
So tell me about your experiences and your story coming into Newport and what was it like?

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.040
What was the culture like?

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:16.040
Well, before I come to Newport, I was in Birmingham for a good while.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:23.040
All my youths, I married and even divorced, and three children in Birmingham.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:28.040
And I said, get up one morning and just leave with my daughter.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.040
And she said, still working.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.040
And I said, right.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.040
You're right now.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.040
You can manage now, eh?

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.040
She said, yes, dad.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.040
They take me up the road.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.040
So you can get yourself and put yourself right.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.040
But the kids, that was the last one I was living with.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.040
And then it was Kelly.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.040
She died now, she died a few years ago.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:57.040
And I found Jim and said, oh, I'm coming down for two weeks.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:05.040
And that two weeks probably lasted for 18 years, 18, 19 years.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:12.040
So I come down and I didn't have the urge to go back, if you know what I mean.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.040
I visited Birmingham because I got friends up there.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.040
But I didn't have the urge to go back.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.040
I started working there.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.040
And I was having good money.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.040
So I was not as good as I was in Birmingham, but not far off.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.040
If with overtime, a lot more.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:37.040
And I could do as much overtime as I wanted, but I limit myself so far.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.040
I work Saturday and Sunday.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.040
Because I get double time for Sunday and time and a half for Saturday.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.040
So I work them.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:51.040
And I do about two hours a night, sometimes in a week.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.040
But mostly hour and a half I done.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:58.040
Going over early and then staying another half an hour and then come home.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.040
So, you know, it helped us to pay off this house.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.040
So ten years we paid this house off.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.040
You know what I mean.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.040
Hard savings to do it.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.040
Really, really hard savings and sacrifice.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.040
But we did it.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.040
Talking about money.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.040
Yeah.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.040
How much did it cost you to come to the UK from Jamaica?

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.040
Oh dear.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.040
Mmm.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.040
It didn't cost me cost Mum.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.040
Oh dear.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.040
It was less than £100.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.040
If I'm not mistaken.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.040
It's about £60, £68.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.040
I can't remember the direct figure.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.040
But I think it's somewhere in that region.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.040
And you flew over.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.040
What was the journey like?

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.040
What was the journey like flying over?

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.040
It was quite comfortable actually.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.040
We stopped off in New York.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.040
For 12 hours.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.040
And you know what I mean.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.040
Being a young lad.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.040
You know you've got like a tutor with you.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.040
So you know you wouldn't get lost or anything.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:37.040
But when I stopped in New York, I quite liked it in there.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.040
I said, oh this is fun.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.040
But it was just coming up to the winter.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.040
This is fun I said.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.040
Quite nice.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.040
And then we boarded the plane again and it took off in England.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:54.040
I was going to, I paid to come to Birmingham.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:31:01.040
So I was waiting for the next plane to take me in from each road to Birmingham.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.040
And Mum come to each road and meet me.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.040
So I lose the third flight.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.040
But I went to school in two weeks.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.040
I didn't have any problems.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.040
People have problems but I didn't have any.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.040
You know what I mean.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.040
It's like I just fit in.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.040
Even the headmaster said, even when I leave in school, the headmaster said,

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.040
I've never seen anyone like that.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.040
I just fit in.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.040
Don't have arguments with nobody or anything.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.040
Just fit in.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:51.040
And what was the education system like in the UK compared to your time in school in Jamaica?

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:59.040
Well, I must admit, the education in Jamaica was good.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.040
But UK was, I would say, slightly better.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.040
I'm going to give you the reason why.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:11.040
Because in Jamaica, you know what I mean, in your class,

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:22.040
English, maths, any other subject you go through, history, geography, science,

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.040
there's only one teacher.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:29.040
You don't leave from one class and go to another class and go to another class.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.040
You've got the same teacher that teaches you everything.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.040
So it took me a while to work it out.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:45.040
So when you start moving up to another class,

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.040
the same teacher does everything.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:58.040
And everything the teachers do, some of them have different ways of bringing it out to you.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:05.040
So it makes you, you know what I mean, you can be confused at times, if I speak the truth.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:12.040
It makes you confused at times because you don't know what's what from what's not.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.040
Because every one of them have a different way of teaching it.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:21.040
But when I come over and go back to school, it's not like that.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.040
To me, the way they do it in England wasn't proper. Why?

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:34.040
This man is like maths, this one is like English, science, history, and things like that.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:40.040
So everybody teaches one subject, if you know what I mean.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:46.040
And he's specializing in that one subject, not specializing in about ten others.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.040
One subject. So he can more or less recite that subject all the way through.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:57.040
And I find that's a better idea of teaching.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:02.040
Even when I go back to Jamaica on holiday, I go back to school,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:09.040
and I actually go and see some of the class teachers and I told them, I said,

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.040
it's all wrong what you're doing, one teacher shouldn't be doing that.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.040
Because one teacher don't know everything.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:21.040
If you specialize in English, that's what you should be teaching.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.040
If you specialize in maths, that's what you should be teaching.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.040
If you specialize in geometry, that's what you should be teaching.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.040
And not one teacher doing all that, you see.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:38.040
And I said, I think now at the moment things are slightly different now in Jamaica with the teaching.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:42.040
But as I said, I enjoy it, you know what I mean.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.040
I never had a police record.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.040
Passed my test first time.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:56.040
And matter of fact, I passed my test a week before I was 17.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:12.040
What do you recall about the food coming into the UK compared to Jamaica?

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:17.040
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no good bars in there. No good bars in the door.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:27.040
Well, you know, from where it's coming from and how long it takes, it's not too bad.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:33.040
But it's not no comparison to the one you eat.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:42.040
You go to Jamaica, you know, you first take a piece of yam, yellow yam or any yam you want.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:47.040
And that yam is fit and you cooked it or you roast it.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.040
So sometimes you roast it.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:55.040
You roast it and you get like a knife and you push it there.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.040
And if it comes up and it's red, it's not bad.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:04.040
So you leave it, you pull the fire out and then eat it and let it soak, let the steam soak it.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.040
And when you're done again and it dries all the way, it's roast.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.040
So you don't peel it then, you scrape it.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:16.040
So you got like a hard skin, like a bacon skin, if you know what I mean.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:26.040
You know like the pig skin, you know, when you fry it and that crispy part of it, that tough crispy, you got like that.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:32.040
So you split it in two, scrape the middle out, let it be a middle out and put butter in it and then close it back.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.040
Then leave it on top of the fire.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.040
Let it simmer then the butter goes all the way through.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.040
And when you eat that man, sometimes the butter runs down there.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:48.040
Oh man, I went back home and I said to them, you know, the first time I went back home, I said to them,

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.040
do you know what I want?

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.040
They said what?

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.040
A piece of roast yam.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:59.040
What I want is you roast it and I scrape it and I put it and then put the butter in.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.040
You know what I mean?

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.040
Just the taste of it.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.040
I tried it over here, don't taste the same.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.040
Don't taste the same.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.040
It's just the taste of it man.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:16.040
And you know, somebody did the food over there my friend.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:22.040
They got some yams over there and you cut it and it looks like you cut it in a dumpling.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:26.040
You know, you cut it and the knife going through slowly.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.040
You take a piece and you chew it, my friend.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.040
Chew it, my friend, it's grimy so you have to, it can choke you.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.040
So you got to be very careful how you eat it, my friend.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:41.040
And the one they call the yellow yam, you rid of it, ain't you?

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:46.040
Back home, my friend, when you got a really good piece of yellow yam,

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:51.040
this is the plait with the food in and this is the jug of water.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.040
Because you need that to eat that.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:02.040
It's that dry, if it slipped on the wrong choke, my friend, you want water.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.040
You want water, my friend.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.040
So you just have some good time, man.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.040
Go to the beach.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.040
So as I said, my uncle was a building contractor.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.040
So he used to build houses all over the place.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.040
So he built sometimes at the seaside so he goes there.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.040
I'm not a strong swimmer, but I could help myself.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.040
You go there, the man, you look out and nobody there.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.040
All clothes are dipping.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.040
Noddy.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.040
Nobody takes it, you know what I'm saying.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.040
Especially the houses away from the road.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.040
Nobody look for your spy on you, man.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.040
You just jump in there, noddy.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:53.040
You look around, dry yourself, pull your clothes out and you're gone.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:01.040
As I said, when you come down the season, orange season,

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:06.040
Stangerine, you got some cold mangerine as well.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.040
Similar to Stangerine, you peel them the same way,

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.040
but they're probably twice as big as Stangerine.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.040
You got star apple.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:19.040
You got apple, you got plums.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:25.040
And each of them don't come in like in the same time.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.040
Weeks apart they come in.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.040
So you have plenty of time to go around.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:34.040
And if you eat this one of the soy, you wipe it off the list.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.040
The one that lives in the birds.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.040
It's got to be sweet, man.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:46.040
Sugar cane time, you go out and you have some cane back home.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:50.040
They call it the governor cane.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:55.040
And the most people's, each house you go to, each home you go to,

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.040
you'll have like one or two roots in there.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.040
You just have to plant one sucker in.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:07.040
And then in about 12 months, my friend, you have about a massive,

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.040
the way it grows, massive, so you can go in there

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:13.040
and break a cane out and nobody misses it.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.040
But it's just the top half and the bottom.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.040
You plant it back somewhere else and then that bears up again.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.040
And peel them as you go.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:30.040
We have all these at home, which we got access to 24-7s.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.040
But we don't trust them.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.040
They're not interested.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.040
We're going to raid other people's.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.040
It's more fun to raid them.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.040
So we raid them and they raid us.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.040
That's what the kids act.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.040
Peer time, they have a call up here.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:55.040
You go down a tree and it's good side, but it's like watery.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.040
No, no, we don't want that.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.040
That's a few pigs.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.040
But anytime we come to a tree and it's dry, you know what I mean?

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:07.040
That's it, my friend, that mark.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.040
And we make sure to time it.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.040
You always have a good climber in the lot.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.040
The bloke who owns it, he said,

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.040
well, climb it up and pick some so I can have some as well to eat.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.040
He goes up and...

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.040
The boy you know you have a bag of pear coming home with.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.040
Orange is the same thing.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.040
Coconut is the same thing.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.040
We used to steal the next door coconut, didn't we?

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:40.040
Mars Ralf, he got about six or seven coconuts.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.040
Mars Ralf, can we have a coconut now?

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.040
But you can buy one.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.040
So I said, OK Mars Ralf, we buy them.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.040
He said, OK, then go and pick them.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.040
I said, no, we pick them later.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.040
So later on, somebody...

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.040
I was a hopeless climber.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.040
Somebody climbed it and then the old bunch of us, we just kick it off.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.040
The old bunch of us, we only buy a few ones.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.040
Sometimes he called us and he said,

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.040
oh, you can, while you're up there, you can bring me some down.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.040
He said, oh yeah, jelly coconut.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.040
You ever drink jelly coconut?

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.040
You don't know what you're missing, son.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.040
You don't know what you're missing.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.040
But you're living...

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.040
When you get a good jelly coconut, you ask your granddad,

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:33.040
you cut it and you put it in the fridge and let it cool.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.040
And then you drink that, my friend, oh man, you don't know what you're missing.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:44.040
So you throw the water out and then you split the husks,

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.040
you know, they are jelly coconut in too because it doesn't get hard.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.040
It's still soft.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:55.040
And you get your cut platter, you chip a little piece of the same outside skin

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.040
and you scoop it out and you eat that.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.040
You know what I mean?

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.040
We call that jelly.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.040
Man, that's...

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.040
Every time I think of it, I think that I want to go home.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.040
Orange is the same thing.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.040
And if the orange tree is sour, we mark it.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.040
Leave that for the birds. We don't want that.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.040
You got some orange, they call it, label orange.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.040
And they're that size and bigger.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.040
You couldn't finish one.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.040
And some of them sweet.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.040
That sweet is cladding.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.040
So you eat two or three pegs and you don't want no more.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.040
You know what I mean?

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.040
You dish it out and give all the rest.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.040
Too sweet cladding.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.040
Can't eat it.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.040
And some of them are that big.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.040
So you think you peel it and you peg it.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.040
So you peg and some of the pegs are about that long.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.040
And they like, throw up all the way down.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.040
You eat two, you don't want no more.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.040
Cladding, man.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:07.040
What was your experience then, tasting British cuisine, British food?

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.040
When I come here first, fish and chips, I like it.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.040
Pie and chips I wasn't too clever about.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.040
I said no.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:26.040
But the fish in the batter, that tastes good to me.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.040
I like it.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.040
And when I go to school, I used to have school dinners.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.040
I used to like some of the puddings over there.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.040
Sponge pudding and things like that with custard.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.040
I used to like that.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.040
But most of the dinners, I mean,

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.040
I would eat a little bit.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:54.040
But I wouldn't finish it because some of them you have to add salt to it.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.040
I said no, I said you're supposed to cook with salt.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.040
When you cook with salt, everything goes in it.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.040
Only salt goes in the food because you put the salt in the water.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.040
So the water cooks the food, so everything goes in there.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.040
But you have to add salt to it.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.040
I didn't see the sense in that.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.040
I just didn't see the sense in that.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.040
Was it easy to keep in touch with friends and family back home?

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.040
Yes and no.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:34.040
Because not many people have a telephone.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.040
Only the wealthy do have telephones.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:50.040
You'd have to go to the town and then you could use a phone in the town.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:59.040
If I want to talk to my mom, I'd write her and give her a number.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.040
She can phone me at that special time.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.040
And then she could phone and then I'll be there.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:10.040
And then whoever owns the phone will talk to her and then hand it to me.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.040
And then you probably say, oh well, you have to pay such and such for the car.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.040
So I just do.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.040
Mom has to pay over here, but it's still cost a bit over there, so you have to pay for it.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.040
But you could still talk to people.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.040
When you're back home and talking.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.040
But mostly you're talking, you do two letters.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.040
You write a letter and send it through the post and she'll get it.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.040
That's how she used to send me money, through the post.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.040
And do you keep in touch with people in Jamaica now?

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.040
Yeah, I do.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.040
I do.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.040
Not as often as I should do, but I still keep in touch with them.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.040
Now and again, I found them over there.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.040
And if anything goes wrong, they'll phone me.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.040
I try and help them if I can.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:14.040
What would you say the biggest tradition or custom that you miss from Jamaica is?

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.040
Fresh fruit.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040
Fresh fruit, man.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.040
Fresh fruit.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.040
Do you ever eat sugar cane?

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.040
Do you eat sugar cane?

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.040
Well, we've got some, they call it the governor cane.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.040
Which is, you know what I mean?

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.040
It's about that big.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.040
And it's big.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.040
But it's not that big.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.040
It's about that big.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.040
And it's big.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.040
But it's soft.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.040
So a joint would be about that long.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.040
From one joint to the next joint, it's about that long.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.040
And you only need that.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.040
If you eat any more, my friend, that wood junkie.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.040
Especially if it's an extra hot day, that wood junkie will be walking up there.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.040
And you don't know where he is.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.040
That wood junkie.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:20.040
Especially if you cut it and put it down for about a week, it starts to ferment.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.040
So you've got a brown stripe all the way through.

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.040
And you eat too much of that, my friend, and you're not going to last long.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.040
You don't last long.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.040
Trust me, you don't last long.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.040
You be drunk.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:41.040
I don't care how strong you are, my friend, you would be drunk.

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:45.040
But that thing will knock you off your feet just like that.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:53.040
It's nice, but when you start eating it, my friend, you don't know when to stop.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.040
And that's the worst part about it.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:06.040
Tell me about music traditions and things you kept in the UK when you were young.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.040
What did you keep in the UK when you came?

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:13.040
Well, the music, when I came to the UK, I was playing music, my friend.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.040
That's not music.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:25.040
I said that's only one beat. The beat goes ching ching ching ching ching ching.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:32.040
I remember when I was going to school, in secondary, having a party.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.040
I said, bring your records in.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:40.040
I bring a few records in, and a few types, and I'm playing it.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.040
I said, where you get these records from?

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.040
I said, those are my country music.

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.040
Oh, they're good.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.040
Do you like our music? I said, not really.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.040
I said, your music is all chingy ling ling ling like a one string.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.040
I said, you have to put, you know what I mean?

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.040
I said, there's no bass in it.

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:12.040
I said, now you listen to this one, now you can hear the bass coming through, all the different instruments coming through.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:20.040
I said, yours is all chingy ling ling ling, every single one on the same, sound the same, especially the beakers.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.040
Which you know, killing yourself.

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:28.040
I said, I'll tell you the other truth, I can't see the beauty about beakers.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.040
I said, to me, they're rubbish.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.040
They said, oh well, every man to his own culture.

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.040
I said, well, there you are.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.040
I said, I couldn't put it better myself.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.040
Every man to his own culture.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.040
What traditions have you given up or had to change?

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:05.040
Not a lot really.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.040
I still eat my western dish food.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:17.040
I like fish and chips, but curry, something like that.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:21.040
No, I prefer the western dish curry.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:27.040
I tried the British curry, I said, no, you're saying to me.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.040
Western dish curry, you can taste it.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.040
The spice in it and the pepper in it.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.040
You're eating that and you're drinking water at the same time.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.040
You're drinking water at the same time.

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.040
I said, no, I said no.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:57.040
Is there any family heirlooms or any photographs or ornaments or anything of particular tradition from Jamaica that you kept?

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.040
I used to.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:03.040
Where they are now, I used to keep them.

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.040
And then when the kids grow up, I distribute them to the kids.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.040
So the kids would have them.

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.040
I mean, not me, the kids would have them.

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:18.040
The last one, the last daughter, Kelly, the one that died, I took her to Jamaica.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.040
She spent what?

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.040
Three months.

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.040
Oh, she didn't want to come back.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.040
She cried a lot.

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:31.040
I took her back to the Antigua Bay airport.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.040
She cried. She didn't want to come back.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:38.040
She said, I don't want to see why I should leave this to go back to where I'm going back to.

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.040
Sometimes I regret it.

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.040
I said, probably if I'd leave her there, she probably would still be alive.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.040
But you never know, isn't it?

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.040
This is where things are.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:58.040
That's the way things are sometimes, my friend.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:04.040
You have to take the good with the bad and the bad with the good.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:14.040
Just finally, you said your time coming to the UK, you fit straight in.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.040
You fit right in.

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.040
I did. I just fit in.

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:29.040
Even when I go to work, I remember I start working on the 8th of April, 1968.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.040
8th of April, 1968.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.040
Printing tool maker.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:38.040
We used to have a block, Mr. King.

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.040
He was a youth employment agency.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:46.040
And he comes to, I used to go to school, Nietzsche Secondary.

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.040
He comes there.

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.040
And he says, right, you leave enough to go to work?

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.040
I said, I haven't find anything yet.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.040
He said, oh, you will find.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.040
With my maths, I'm really hoping maths.

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.040
Really that.

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.040
He said, I said, what you want to do?

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.040
I said, well, carpentry.

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.040
He said, you can do better than that.

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.040
A lot better than that.

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:16.040
He said, you don't want to go there and it's cold and snow and stand up in that.

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.040
He said, no.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.040
So that's why I go into engineering.

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.040
I was a tool maker engineer.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:27.040
I started off with forging tools.

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.040
You know forging tools.

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.040
I started off forging tools on the head of press tools.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:39.040
Some press tools I built couldn't go through them double doors.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.040
And meow.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.040
From start to finish.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.040
Some of them take me up to nine months.

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.040
Massive.

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.040
And some of them are that big.

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:53.040
So I enjoy.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.040
But when I come down to Wales, I didn't do press tools.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.040
You know me, I probably do a couple.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.040
But not much.

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.040
I was more into CNC machines.

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:07.040
You know me, I watched the blogs and working it and programming it.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.040
I said, if you can do that, my friend, I can do that.

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.040
They got no training.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.040
They just watched them.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.040
See what they was doing.

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:20.040
And then I met another chap named Gref.

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.040
He was much better than I am.

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.040
And sometimes he showed me if I'm doing it.

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.040
He said, you're doing it the hard way, man.

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:29.040
He said, you cycle.

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.040
You cycle.

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.040
And he showed me how to do that.

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.040
I said, that's all right, man.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.040
I said, that's great.

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.040
So I put the cycle.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.040
He said, you're going to write it again.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.040
All you do is call back the cycle.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:50.040
And he comes back and he does all over again the same thing.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.040
And it goes to the next cycle.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.040
So I was doing it.

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.040
And I said, I'm going to write it again.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.040
And he said, you're going to write it again.

00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.040
And he goes to the next cycle.

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.040
So I was doing a program.

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:07.040
I could make a program to do probably that clock there.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.040
And I used 50 lines.

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:17.040
And when he finished, you would see the same shape of the clock there.

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.040
You see everything at the front there.

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.040
You see it.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.040
50 lines.

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.040
All cycles.

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.040
I used cycles.

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.040
So I enjoyed it.

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:40.040
And if there was anything that you could pass on, any messages or anything to future generations, what would you say?

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.040
Listen.

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.040
Use this.

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:51.040
Drugs and smoking weed and things like that, my friend, they're all good for you.

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.040
It kills you.

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.040
It kills you.

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.040
And don't care what anyone say, my friend.

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.040
You smell smoking weed, my friend.

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:05.040
And the more you, if you smoke a joint today, I because I never tried, I never smoke in my life.

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:09.040
But I got friends and cousins who smoke.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:14.040
And they said, when they smoke, you said you have to know how to do it, my friend.

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.040
You have to learn how to control that.

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:22.040
Because it will tell you.

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.040
It will give you that, that like, that demand.

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:34.040
If you smoke a joint today, to feel the same way tomorrow, you have to smoke a joint and a half.

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:39.040
And they said, if you, if you're going to do that, my friend, you are in big trouble.

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.040
You can't, you can't angle it.

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.040
So if you can't angle a thing, stay away from it.

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.040
So that's what I do.

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.040
I don't smoke and I stay away from it.

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.040
Don't get me wrong.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:55.040
They say marijuana, I'll get some and I'll buckle it and throw white rum on top of it.

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.040
Leave it there.

00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:03.040
And I tell you, after about three or four months, it turns green.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:09.040
And if you have an upset stomach, my friend, you only need a tablespoon.

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.040
And you drink that, my friend.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.040
Throw in about twice as much water as you throw out.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.040
And you drink that.

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:23.040
And I tell you this much, my friend, in about an hour's time, anything down there shifted.

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.040
And you'll be ending up in the toilet.

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:29.040
And after that, my friend, everything just go.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.040
You feel a bit weak, but everything just go.

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.040
And you feel, in about a couple of hours, you'll feel 100% again.

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:42.040
It's like a medicine, but you don't feed and you don't smoke it.

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:44.040
And that's what we, you know what I mean?

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:50.040
You buckle it, put it in the buckle, rub it in there, then pour the white rum on it.

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.040
And you turn it green.

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.040
And you leave it there for a few months, my friend.

00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.040
And you have to use the tap there.

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:09.040
If you use just the English cork in the bathroom, you'll get a lot of smoke.

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:14.040
In the night, you probably hear the buckle going, boom, boom.

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.040
When you straight hit them, they blow it up.

00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.040
So you have to use the screw to hold it there.

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.040
But, you know what I mean?

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:32.040
If you, you know, if you couple catch you in Jamaica with it, they'll arrest you when I was there.

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:39.040
But if you have a little bit, if you plant some of it on purpose and they come and see it, it won't be a problem.

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:46.040
But if they see a big bung, they know you're doing it, it's a business, they'll arrest you because it's not legal.

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.040
It's legal.

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:55.040
I know probably they make it legal now, which is to me one of the worst things they've ever done.

00:59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.040
Because people out there know, my friend, who smoke it, you can't trust them.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:04.040
One minute they arrest you, the next minute they can just turn and all that.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.040
And they'll kill you.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.040
You can't trust them.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.040
It's a good thing, but it's a bad thing.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.040
If you use it the wrong way, it's bad.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.040
So you have to know what you're doing.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.040
As I said, I don't smoke.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:37.040
I tried a cigarette once, and I remember taking the second puff, and that was it.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.040
When I woke up it was 12 hours later.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:59.040
I'm not happy about that. 12 hours later I said, no, this is not for me, my friend. Not for me. Cut it out. Not for me.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.040
Is there anything final that you would like to add?

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:15.040
In England, since I've been over here, if I'm going to tell anybody I haven't seen pretty, I'm lying.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.040
You see how?

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:24.040
But it never been used on me, if you know what I mean.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.040
I always get down with people.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:37.040
The department I work in, when I work in Cumberland, visiting, I was the only black person in there.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:49.040
You go in the canteen, and 90% of you are the only black in the canteen.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.040
But I'm fit in.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:58.040
I don't go in and tell people, oh well, I'm black and I'm the one who's mixed with you.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:05.040
My grandfather always says, when you go to another country, it's not yours, so you're fit in.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.040
It's not your country.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.040
Even in Jamaica, it's your own country, so you're fit in.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.040
You can't say, oh well, I'm a Jamaican, so I can't do anything.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.040
He said, no you can't.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:24.040
There's law and orders anywhere you go in this world, so you have to learn how to fit in.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.040
And I said to you, I never come with no running with polythene, I have to put on and cover my hands.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.040
Never in my life.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.040
And now I'm 71, I don't intend to, to go that far.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:44.040
I mean, if I tell anybody I haven't been stopped for speeding, I'll be lying.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.040
But I've never been booked for speeding.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.040
I stopped, showed my license, they said, okay, that's it, don't do it again.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.040
And that's it.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.040
But they book you and then give you points on your license for speeding? No.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040
Never had that.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.040
I even caught it on camera.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.040
I'll get away with it.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.040
I'll get away with it.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:19.040
I said, I had a good life in this country, and I find a lot of those been on for me.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.040
A hell of a lot of those.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.040
Because I have respect for everybody.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.040
You know what I mean?

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.040
People go, oh well, you have to watch them.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.040
I said, no man, I said everybody do their own thing, my friend.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.040
You have to do yours.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:45.040
Whether he's white, black, Asian, or what you want to call him?

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.040
He does his own thing, you do your own.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:56.040
He said, just, just all you got to remember is have respect for what he does and he will have respect for what you does.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.040
I said, you can't remember that, my friend.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040
You'll go far away.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.040
Don't go and tell him, so what he's doing is wrong.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.040
Because to him what he's doing is right.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.040
And what you're doing to you is right.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:14.040
Don't go and tell him, people say, oh well man, you're doing it the wrong way.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.040
I said, no man. I said everybody have to make his own mistake.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.040
I said, I make mistakes.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040
I make a few.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.040
Sometimes I like to turn the clock back, but you can't.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.040
So you're stuck with it.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:35.040
So the best thing to do is to say we can avoid it and say we can pass it over and get on with what's in front of you.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.040
Well, it's been an absolute pleasure and a colourful story.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.040
I visualised being in Jamaica and, you know, the fresh fruit.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:53.040
And it's fantastic that you've had such an amazing experience, you know, we're here in the UK.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.040
I just want to thank you so much for your time today.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:56.540
Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:57.540
Thank you.
