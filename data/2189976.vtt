00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, and did know, during the longest yarn.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.880
I have Joan Barnes with me and she's going to talk about her childhood during the war.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.720
Joan, have you got any special memories for us?

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:23.200
Yes, we have lots of special memories really. I can remember how the war broke out and I

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.680
can remember neighbours getting together and crying because the war, their husbands would

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:40.160
be either going into the army or the forces or the home guard. So it was an upsetting

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:50.400
time. I would be at school soon afterwards and of course we all had masks.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.600
So you had gas masks?

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.640
Oh yes, my younger brother had one in a box and it was a Mickey Mouse one. It was in a box and

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.800
they sat in it and as they got a little bit older they had a Mickey Mouse one. So they used to put

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.000
them on their face and flap their nose.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.280
So they had a Mickey Mouse nose on it?

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.920
Yes they did.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.800
Goodness. So what other memories? Did your dad go to war?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.800
No, my father didn't go to war because we were from a mining village and he worked down the pit.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:36.880
But odd warms have in the family. My dad's brother was in the war and he went abroad. He did come

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.080
back. He came back safely.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.240
So do you remember rationing then?

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.080
Oh yes. We had ration books until the 50s because they got married in the 50s so I know they still

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.120
had ration books.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.880
So did you feel that you wanted to eat sweets or you wanted more butter? But you were in a mining

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.520
community so was there farms?

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.640
Yes, there was no thought of saying I want to eat sweets and stamp my feet. No, no, there was

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.960
no sweets and that was it. Yes. We used to eat, mum used to peel a carrot and you could eat a

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.680
raw carrot.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.480
A very satisfying raw carrot.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.240
Yes, yes.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.120
So were there any bad memories that you have?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.680
I don't remember much about it but an aircraft did go over the village and swept quite low

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:42.480
and dropped a bomb on the edge of the village. They never knew whether he got a spare one or

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.800
whether he was aiming for the colliery so we never knew that.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.320
And was anyone hurt in the...

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.000
No, no but the plagues it was because it crashed.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.720
Oh, right.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.320
Yes, a German crashed.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.680
And so...

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.600
And then there was the wardens. Another thing is you have to black out your windows,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600
they said be knocking on your door.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.720
And where did you go if there was an air raid siren or just wasn't there because...

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:21.040
Well, they built air raid shelters. I don't know how good they'd be because they were brick.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.560
I think most probably there was wires somewhere in the roof of them.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.240
But people got together, brought neighbours together. I know we used to get under the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.040
stairs and that would have made a difference but you felt you were close and coming up.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.720
It brought neighbourhood together, it brought people together.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.680
So you think that maybe it was a time for being more social and friendlier?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.640
Because sometimes conflict does bring people together.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.240
I think so, yeah. And even before that, people, all their husbands worked in the coronary so

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.440
everybody was on level with... Yes.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.160
So your childhood really, despite the fact that the war ran through your childhood...

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.240
It didn't. No, it didn't.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.880
You were happy.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.720
Yeah, if we were in school, they'd got cellars underneath and we used to go there.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.880
And it was horrible because there was this like sandy smell.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.520
So we'd all go in with pinching our noses.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.360
On that note then, Joan, I'll say thank you very much indeed.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.680
Thank you.
