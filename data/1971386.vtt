00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So the lady that played Jemima was a lady called Yvonne Fox. Unfortunately she died before I moved here so I never got to meet her.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But she is a local legend. If you ever mention Jemima then I would say nine times out of ten Yvonne Fox is mentioned in the next sentence.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
She's still revered by everybody and she played Jemima for quite a long time I think.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I think it came about from the bicentenary of the invasion. That's when she really kicked in sort of thing.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But there's a marble bust of her in the library, in the gallery where the tapestry is.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But what makes me smile about that is our current Jemima, Kay, is very tall and very, very slim.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
She's very slim with, well she's grey now, but she did have dark curly hair.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And Yvonne was very short, very buxom, blonde and you know like the complete opposite. They are the complete opposites.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Kay is far more the original Jemima than Yvonne was physically.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
But spiritually, you ask anybody in the town, nobody will ever come close to Yvonne Fox.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The spirit of her or the spirit of Jemima in her was huge. She has a legacy.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
In fact the last couple of Jemimas that we had, Jackie, a lady called Jackie played her for a little bit.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
She was dark haired. I mean she was a bit more buxom and a bit more fuller, cuddlier than Kay Slim.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But they got a lot of resistance, both of them, at the start of them taking on the role.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Not because they weren't like Jemima, because they weren't Yvonne Fox.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It was quite an amazing legacy to leave really. And she has no idea.
