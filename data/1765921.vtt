00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
Hello, my name is Sharon Calder and I work for Mencap but I've also been the lead facilitator

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.000
of Masquerade and this is my ninth year of doing that and I'm here to chat with Robert.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.760
So Robert, do you want to introduce yourself? What's your name?

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.000
My name is Robert.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Brilliant, thank you Robert.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And it's Monday the 26th of May 2021.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
No, it's not Monday.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Thank you Robert.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's Wednesday.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's a good job you're here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Wednesday the 26th of May 2021.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Brilliant.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we're here today to talk about Masquerade.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So Robert, you have dipped in and out of Masquerade, I would say, the whole time I've been running it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But I think for about the last three years you've become like a proper Masquerade member

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and you come to all the Wednesdays.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So what is it about Masquerade? What do you like best about Masquerade?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Masquerade, yeah.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Out of the things that we do, like let's try and remember what we do.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Can you remember what we do?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We did...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We do acting.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Acting, we did musicals.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So we've done loads of singing, yeah.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We've done grief.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Cats.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Cats.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Lion King.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Yeah, Lion King, yeah. And you've had a big part in all of them.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Yeah.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So what is it about performing that you enjoy?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
What is it about performing that you enjoy?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It's just being me.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Oh, it's being you.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Yeah.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Oh, that's a great answer.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So you like standing on the stage being you.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Yeah.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And do you enjoy having the audience there?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Yeah.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Ah.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So Lamvattlin really loves Masquerade and values it, the people in Lamvattlin.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And performing for all the people of Lamvattlin.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Yeah.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So we do different performances, don't we?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We do St. Muttlin's Day.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Can you remember what we do on St. Muttlin's Day usually?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We gather in the street.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Oh yeah, the street, yeah.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And we do parading, don't we?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Yeah.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Where do we parade?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Where do we walk with all our instruments?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Down the street.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Yes, we go down the high street and we go round the back of the houses, don't we?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And what do we do when we're parading?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I don't know.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We usually have...

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We have drums and...

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Yeah, instruments.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And we just basically make loads of noise.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
But it's good fun, isn't it?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It's good fun.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And the people of the town are always really smiley and they always look really happy to see us.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And they always make everyone shush when we walk past.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
They switch off, because sometimes there's background music, because it's the festival day.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
They always switch it off when we come, so we can make a good big racket.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Now we've also performed at the Myvred Show a couple of times.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Have you been to the Myvred Show with us?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Yes.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Yeah?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Yes, I think you did too.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Possibly the space one.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Oh yeah, the space one, yeah.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Yeah.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Can you remember what we held when we were doing the space shows?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Because the other thing we do in Masquerade is the art, isn't it?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And the making of our props.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Do you remember making all of those planets?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Yeah.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Yeah.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And parading with the planets?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Oh yeah.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So we did that and we did our show all about...

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Can you remember?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
No.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Selwyn was the main character.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And he had a helmet on.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Oh yeah.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Could you remember who he was?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The spaceman.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Yes!

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Well done, you.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
He was the spaceman.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And we talked about the spaceman and how he'd got lost and he had to visit all the different planets.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Yeah.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
You remember that one now.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Yeah.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Oh, that's good.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Yeah.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Good.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Can you also remember what happened on the St. Muttlin's Day, Parade Day one day, when

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
it just poured with rain, where we had to go?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Remember we had to move the performance indoors.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Can you remember where we ended up?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
No.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Don't you remember being in the church?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Oh yes.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Yeah.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Oh yeah, because it poured down the rain.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
No.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So how did you find that performance in the church?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Good.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
It was good, wasn't it?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It was almost like the church was like a theatre space.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And we walked all around it, didn't we?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
We walked around all the pews and we used all the different parts of the church.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And we sang,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Here comes the sun, da da da da,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Here comes the sun, I say it's alright,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Do do do do do do do.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Because I know you love music, don't you?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I love music, yeah.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So tell us about your tiny little CD collection.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
We've got a lot.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
You've got a lot, haven't you?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Yeah.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And in Masquerade we try and use a lot of music.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
What's your favourite type of music?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Dunno.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Have a think. I think I remember what your favourite type of music is.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It's country and western.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Yeah, I think you're right. It's country and western, isn't it? Yeah.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
We've tried to do a bit of that in Masquerade.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Yeah.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
We've tried various other evenings.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So when Masquerade has had to go on Zoom this year, how have you found that?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Good.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Good? Ah, what's been good about that?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Internet's not working.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Or sometimes if the internet's not working it could be a problem. Yeah.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Yeah, because they're a bit slow sometimes when...

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
You're right. Sometimes we freeze.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Yeah.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
But I think you've been especially good at going away in the weeks in between

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and thinking about what we're doing, what topic or theme we're doing,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and bringing things to us and then presenting the things.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Can you remember any of the things you've done?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Anything you've brought?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Drawings?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Yeah.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
What?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
You've brought your baby photos?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Oh, yeah.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Do you remember that?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Oh yeah, and then we did stuff about holidays, didn't we?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Oh, and that was your suggestion, wasn't it? You wanted to talk about holidays.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Yeah.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Yeah, yeah, we did a whole session on holidays.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
That was really good and you brought loads of photos.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Yeah.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
That was a great session and everybody really wanted to talk about their holidays.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Yeah.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I think it was because it was the year, last year of Covid, where nobody had a holiday.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So we all wanted to talk about holidays, didn't we, because we were missing them.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Yeah.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So have you found doing it on Zoom... I mean, I suppose you don't have to travel.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
You just do it from your own home or your mum's or your house in my smuggling.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Has that been quite good?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Yeah.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Yeah.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So that's been great.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And what about using it as a means of keeping in touch with all your friends in Masquerade?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Yeah.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Because you might not have seen people at all other than that, might you?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
No.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
No.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So who are the people that you really like working with in Masquerade?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Who makes you laugh most?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Selwyn.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Selwyn, yes.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Michelle.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Michelle, yeah.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Yeah.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I don't know.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
What about Alex and Ryan?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Yeah.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
They're good fun, aren't they?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And Angela.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And Angela, yeah.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Yeah, because everyone's always pleased to see each other, aren't they?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
We're all pleased to see each other on Zoom.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I don't know if you were there, still there last week, or you might have popped off when we talked about starting to come back together, like outside in real life.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I was there, yeah.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Or were you?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I was there, yeah.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Because most people said they were a bit slightly nervous about it still, weren't they?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Mm-hm.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I don't know how you felt about that.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
What?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Were you one of the people who was a bit nervous about it, or were you keen to get back together properly?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I'm a bit nervous about it, yeah.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Yeah.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Yeah.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So we left it that we'd leave it at least another month before we talked about that again.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
But it would be nice to see everyone in the flesh.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But I think everyone's quite used to Zooming now, so, you know, that's OK.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So have you got any more ideas for themes or anything you might want us to look at coming up this year?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Do you want to do any more musicals or?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I don't know.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
See what happens.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Mm-hm.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
See what happens.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
OK.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Great.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
All right then.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Well, here's some Ascorade coming back as normal, maybe a bit later on in the year.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Yeah.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
We'll put on another show.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Mm-hm.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
You'll be able to get in your costume.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Mm-hm.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Do some singing and some dancing.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
This just still fits me, eh?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I've got a big fat belly.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It still fits you.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000
So I've got the Arts Connection Annual Report here, and you and Rhian, especially, are on the front cover.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And Geraint.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And Geraint as well, and you're all in your costumes, and it's in the middle of our show we did about the Greek gods, isn't it?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Yeah.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And do you remember what god you were?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
No.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Ares.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Do you remember what he was the god of?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
No.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Was he the god of sweetness?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
No.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
What was he the god of?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The...

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
He was the god of...

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Was he the god of peace?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
No.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
No.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
He was the opposite of peace, so what was he, the god of...

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
What?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
War?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
War, yeah.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So what kind of personality did he have?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Do you remember?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
No.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Was he quiet and sweet?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
No.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
What was he then?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Angry.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Angry and loud!

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
That's right, and I remember specially casting you, Zapp, because you were a sweet, gentle person.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And I thought it might be fun for you to be an angry, loud god of war.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Do you remember what you were doing with the audience?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
No.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
You were growling at them and stamping your feet!

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
You remember that, you were very good. Did you enjoy that then?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Yeah.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Yeah, yeah. So well done for getting on the front cover. That's really great.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I'm tired and runny.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Oh, you're tired now? Well, shall we finish up? It's been lovely to chat to you about Masquerade.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Yeah, it's been lovely, yeah.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Well, thank you, Robert. It's been brilliant to chat to you. And long live Masquerade!
