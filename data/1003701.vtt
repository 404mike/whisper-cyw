WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
A few high notes there.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.320
Now, this is not another marketing survey,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.360
but it is traditional at this point in the program

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.200
to recognize people who've traveled some distances

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.520
to come and be with us today.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.040
So first of all, would the people from Portland

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.840
or other points in Oregon please stand and be recognized?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720
Let's give them a round of applause.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:39.520
Now, I know that we've got people here from Vancouver also.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.480
Would they please stand?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.800
British Columbia, yes.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.760
We have people here from Victoria.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.600
Would they please stand?

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.720
Hey, good job.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.480
Now, we also have people from California.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.600
Could they please stand?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.160
Any other states?

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.240
Anybody here from Wales?

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.000
I mean more recently than that.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.480
England?

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.400
No.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.840
Scotland?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.320
No.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.120
OK.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.960
Did I miss anybody?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.200
We covered Algeria.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.360
Algeria.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.560
OK.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.200
Now, I think the next thing is the announcements.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.400
And I have several announcements here.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.560
First of all, I understand Sally Brinkley,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.200
the president of the Victoria Welsh Society,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.320
would like to say a few words.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.320
Sally here?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.240
Ah, there she is.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.240
Sally, do you want to come up front,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240
or can you do it from there?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.240
I don't know how to say it.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.240
I don't know.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.240
We're so glad that you're here.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.720
We knew all the people from the Florida Society.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.520
We're very sorry that you missed your last announcement.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.520
But please, we're strangers.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520
We're going to take you off the road.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.520
Oh.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.520
But we know that you have a very lovely family.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.520
And I hope next year we'll give you a journey.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.520
But maybe you'll come over to join us in a photographic

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.520
trip on our barbecue.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.520
That would be in July.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.520
And hopefully, six of you are.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520
I have one day.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.320
I'm counting on you to come to see it on our trip.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.320
So it's lovely to see you all.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.320
That's the word.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.320
Thank you very much, Sally.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:13.320
The next announcement I have is from the Welsh Society of

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.320
Vancouver, B.C.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.320
They wish to extend a warm and very special invitation to all

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.320
their friends in Seattle to join them in celebrating in June

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.120
1989, the 60th anniversary of the Cambrian Hall.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.120
It's on Saturday, June 17th.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.120
They will have a Norsen Lauen.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.120
And on Sunday, June 18th, at 11 a.m., a bilingual service

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.120
which will be led by the Reverend Berwyn Roberts.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.120
There will also be a lunch.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.120
And then at 2 o'clock, there will be a Gamandagany followed

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.120
by, of course, the Te Ba.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.120
Next announcement.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.920
There's going to be a Worldfest 89 at Northgate Mall next

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.920
weekend.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.920
It used to be called the Ethnic Fair, I believe.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.920
And the Welsh group is going to participate.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.920
They're going to have a booth there.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.920
We need some more volunteers to work at the booth.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.920
I think there are some sign-up seats here somewhere today.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920
Is that correct?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.920
Anybody have those?

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.920
Kayla Ware had them out front.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.920
Yes, Kayla has them.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.920
So you can see here after we finish here.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.920
We would like some volunteers to make Welsh cakes.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.920
If you know how to do that.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.920
If you don't, we do have recipes.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.920
They're very easy to make.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.920
Even I can do it.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.920
One other call for help.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.920
If you have a pickup or a van, then we could certainly use

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.920
some help to transport our booth to the Worldfest.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.920
We would need it late Thursday evening or early Friday morning.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.920
And then we would need it again on Sunday evening to take

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920
everything back down again.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.920
So please see Kayla Ware during the tear back if you can help.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.920
Lots of announcements here.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.920
I think I've lost one.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.920
Here it is.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.920
May 7th at the Lake City Presbyterian Church here.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.920
We're going to have a service where the Corcum Righ is going to

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.920
join with the choir of the Lake City Church and sing together.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.920
We're singing Mordechristi I believe.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.920
And what else?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:31.920
It will be a very good program.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.920
I can promise you that.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.920
And it's at 10 o'clock.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.920
AM.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.920
Thank you.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.920
Did I miss any announcements?

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.920
Anybody got anything else they want to announce?

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.920
I wanted to say if anybody has a young child or a grandchild or

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.920
nephew or niece or child of a friend or any child in their life

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.920
that they would consider teaching to respond for next year's

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.920
children of the same.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.920
Please contact my mother.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.920
And I want to add, she paid for taking us.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.920
Got all these songs for me.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.920
And it might not be serious because we were very proud.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.920
It was not easy.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.920
But she got us to teach us.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.920
It's a wonderful thing to teach these children.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.920
And if you really want to do it, my mother will help buy a

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.920
tape or whatever else.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.920
So if you have any children, and I want to add also that these

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.920
children are our future and they're going to be enjoying the

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.920
future to listen to the things we've taught.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.920
So make the effort if you know anybody who you think you could

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.920
teach these to who might be able to be here next year and join

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.920
one day with them.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.920
Real children's choir going on here.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920
Thank you.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.920
Thank you, Martha.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.920
And now a short commercial break, folks.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.920
Most people realize that when you put on an event like this,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.920
there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.920
Obviously, it's all volunteer.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.920
But what some people don't realize is that it does cost

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.920
quite a bit of money to put on an event like this.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.920
I'm not going to bore you with all the details of that,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.920
but believe me, it does cost quite a bit of money.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.920
One of the major expenses, not surprisingly, is the program.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.920
We do ask that you make a donation.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.920
There will be, the baskets will be passed around while the choir

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.920
sings the obituary to be a rave iced.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.920
But please, please give generously.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.920
We don't try to make money on this,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.920
but we do want to cover our expenses so that we can maintain

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.920
a fund so that each year we can put on a gamanba like this.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.920
Thank you.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.920
And now the choir will sing Tadi Arad iced

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.920
while the ushers will pass the collection baskets around.
