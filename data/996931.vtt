00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Sing me that, O I am all-sager, Where I can never leave.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:26.000
From a bold hand, straightly giller, Shall control me, or from me.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I can never, I can never, I can never, Where there is a truth to tell.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But with faith I will be saved.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm a man, he'll be a trouble, When we are troubled and rare.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But with faith I will be saved.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm a man, he'll be a trouble, When we are troubled and rare.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Where there is a truth to tell.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But with faith I will be saved.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm a man, he'll be a trouble, When we are troubled and rare.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'm a man, he'll be a trouble, When we are troubled and rare.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm a man, he'll be a trouble, When we are troubled and rare.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I'm a man, he'll be a trouble, When we are troubled and rare.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Hallelujah, my God!
