00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
an airplane landed on the beach at Port?

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.840
Yes, one of ours, luckily.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.920
Nothing very exciting, it was only

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.360
an airplane used for towing

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.160
airborne targets.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.320
The airplane was flown from Towing,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.160
where there was a military base there, and an airstrip.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.080
They were flown for the anti-aircraft base,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.600
training base at Tom Van Hyne near Towing.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.960
So that was everlasting flying up, parallel to both

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.640
beach you could say, maybe two or three miles out, maybe a bit more.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.440
And that was being everlasting shot at, you know.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.640
So there we are, that used to go up and down,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680
it was just there, you know, eventually.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.040
It was just part of the scenery again, you know.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.400
Do you know why it landed on the beach?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.480
Yes, the airplane that landed on the beach wasn't actually from Towing,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.600
the same type of plane, a Hawker Henley.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.400
It was a Hawker Henley on loan to the Rolls Royce company

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.680
as a test bed for the Rolls Royce Vulture engine,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.320
which was being developed at that time,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.440
being put into, hopefully into the Avro Manchester,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.040
forerunner of the Lancaster.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.400
And it was put into a Hawker Henley to fly around the country to test it.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.600
And the engine broke down and it landed in both,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.880
and they had to put another engine in.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.200
That also broke down.
