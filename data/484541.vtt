Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Interviewee Ewan Lewis. The location of the interview is the Swicker office.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And today's date is the 3rd of October 2015.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Ewan, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full for the record?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Of course, Ewan Lewis. I-W-A-N-L-E-W-I-S.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
For the rest of this reminiscence, I will of course be referring to you as Jeeves.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
For that is your nickname. And everyone in the company knows and loves you as Jeeves.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Which is probably a good question to start with. Why are you called Jeeves?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Very good question actually Steve. Spanned from, let's see, going back many years now in the school days.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
There was a bunch of us, a bunch of guys who studied electronics.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And it sort of got to the point of, well, should we say I was a bit of a spoff in electronics.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Nothing quite like what I am now.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So, yeah, there was just a few random questions that were sort of brought on by the teacher.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Nobody seemed to know the answer. And it was sort of passed down the line as you could imagine in a school environment.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Nudging the person to your left was the answer to number one.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And it sort of got to one of the guys, James I think it was, and he went, I don't know, ask Jeeves over there.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And it sort of stayed from there. I never had a nickname before moving through school or anything.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I took the fancy to Jeeves.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I have to say you're the only Jeeves I know of. Have you met any other in real life?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I know of no other Jeeves whatsoever.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
There's a uniqueness to your Jeeve velocity which is all yours.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Yeah, quite.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Well, let's try and think back now to when we first met each other.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I can recall going down to Cardiff Bay, which obviously had been redeveloped.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Yeah.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And there in front of the New Wales Millennium Centre was a piece of ground, an area which we called the Oval Basin.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
But I think its official name is Plas Roald Dahl.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You could be right.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Yeah, absolutely. Most of us know it as the Oval Basin.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's a basin and it's oval shaped.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Quite right.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That's common parlance for you.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And to my joy and amazement, I saw a group of young people bocking.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So I was introduced to, I saw bocking.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
What were you all up to?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Last sunny Sunday afternoon?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I ask myself this many, many, many times over what we were doing down there.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So, well, yeah, let's start from the start.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The reason we're bocking in its entirety is basically, if you can imagine the prosthetics that you see some of those Paralympians running with the blades,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
it's basically one of them, but for fully bodied people.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So they're a stilt in essence with a carbon fibre blade on the back that propels you nine, 10 foot up in the air and allows you to run 30 miles an hour by taking nine foot strides.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And my first, you know, the sheer movement and kinetic movement.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I mean, here was a group of lads and I think one or two girls as well who were not really sort of taking like giant leaps as if they were on the moon.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But we're doing somersaults, back somersaults, flips sideways.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
What were some of the moves that I would have seen?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Well, you would have seen some basic stuff.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Well, let's start with a jump in.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So a kanga hop.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Imagine a kangaroo jumping away.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So that's one of the basic things.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But then you evolve them into some stunts similar to that of skateboarding.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So you'd have a spring grab.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
You do a split kick.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Star jumps would be another one.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And then until you sort of get onto the more technical movements then of somersaults, back flips, jumping up and down big, huge blocks.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
You know, just think of the sort of gymnastic things, stuff you'd see on the spring floor or a trampoline.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I suppose that's one way to describe it.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
You've got a trampoline on each foot.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
That's brilliant.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You know, in Swicko and in Cardiff Carnival we've had for a number of years, we've had still performers, some of them professional, who then taught others to move around.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And whilst it gave us the height and sometimes if you got somebody moving on four stilts,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
you know, you had fun to play with in terms of costume.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It didn't give us the levity.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I mean, you guys seem to be like sort of fleas on a God knows what, a diseased tramp.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
You were bouncing around.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
There was all this energy.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So somehow not only were you higher than everybody else because you're on stilts and you're raised up,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
but as you say, you appear to have a couple of coil springs or springy old jacks you look like.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
It was quite a revelation for me.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So it was quite important to go over and say hello.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I met the Bokkers, yourself and somebody else who was to feature heavily in the Cardiff Carnival Bocking story.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Your cohort, Dom, who I think we have to pay tribute to.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
He can't be here today because he's celebrating his 21st birthday on route to New York, I believe.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Yeah, jammy person.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Yeah, definitely.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So, um, met yourself and the other Bokkers.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And at that time, besides doing the annual carnival, Swickr was trying to think how how we could develop carnivals and art form.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And sometimes in the history of the carnival, we have attempted, particularly when we had effectively a stage in front of the National Museum of Wales to tell a story of sorts.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And I went back to that idea and thought, like, how can we, with a smaller group of people, try and begin and tell stories through carnival arts, through the making the movement and by bringing on new and interesting art forms and cultural phenomena.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And of course, Bocking fell into that, didn't it?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
It did. Yeah.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It did. Yeah, well, and truly, I mean, it was it was something that I wasn't aware of, of you guys before you approached us.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And, you know, as you just explained, it was something that you'd never seen before.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And I think it did bring a certain sort of uniqueness to what it was.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And, you know, with the flow of everything, when we're up on stilts, not being able to stand still.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So it was always that constant sort of flow and movement when we sort of started to get into the carnival and Swickr with you guys, obviously,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
along with all of the sort of costumes that we were wearing and the dressage and everything.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
It was a very unique sort of style.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Yes, I think I believe.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Yeah.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
The very first production was, of course, Dragons.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And we were trying to tell through our own sort of carnival prism, the story of the Merlin's prophecy of the eternal battle between the white Anglo-Saxon dragon.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Boo, his Celtic red dragon.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
So, yes, you and fellow bockers featured in Dragon.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
What are your memories of that?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Do you still wake up screaming?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
OK, just for the record, we were all quite new to the actual bocking event or to the bocking sort of skill set.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So there was only a select few of us that could perform to the standards that you were looking for.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
But no, I look back on it with with great memories, lots of fun.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
It was a really good time.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:18.000
It was a good sort of bonding session with not just us as the bockers, to which we sort of established over the last year or so, but with you guys as well, being part of something, being able to show our skills off with more people, with more crowds and venturing into different avenues that we never thought that we could possibly get into.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So it was a tremendous sort of success for on, you know, a partnership between us as the bockers and yourself as Swicker, you know, just propelled us without no puns, you know, well and truly into the next stage.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
The atmosphere.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I mean, the crowds always loved you guys on parade.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Of course, Carnival Theatre, we followed up.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Dragons with magic.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Of course you played a pivotal role in that magic.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
The story of Dr.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
John D.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And of course, who uses the myth of the 11th century discovery of the new world by Prince Maddock and who gets to play Prince Maddock on stills.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Would you care to tell us what you were dressed on?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
What was that like?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
What was that like?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Because you had to, you had to, you had to, on jumping stills, on bocking stills, you had to move from North Wales right across the Atlantic to the new world, to America, didn't you?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I thought that was quite fun.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Yeah, that was just us down to a tee really, getting from one space to another in the most exciting way possible, I think.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And, you know, on jumping stills, why not?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Dressed in Welsh gear, so the Welsh flags, the vests, I think we had kilts on as well, going from one side, Wales, over to the other, to the new world, over to America to face off with the Indians, if I recall correctly.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Jumping around and performing and somersaulting and nearly landing on backsides a few times.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Have you ever fallen off, Jeeves?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Of course.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Of course.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
There we are.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Isn't it a secret to falling off and not, because you're here, you're hailed, you're hearty, you didn't actually limp into the room.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
No, no, I was quite one of the fortunate ones, I think.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I managed to get away, scaved only with bruises and cuts.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Yeah, right.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Don't get me wrong, you know, the sport did attract us dangers.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
There were a few people that broke their legs, their collarbones, etc.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Don being one of them, breaking his collarbone.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
A few coccyxes along the way, if that's the correct word for plural of coccyx, I'm not too sure.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
More than one coccyx?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Yeah, more than one coccyx.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
We'll go and look at that in the future.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But yeah, definitely, you know, it was definitely one of the extreme sports.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Like I said, it did draw us dangers.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So not only did you join us in our carnival theatre ventures, but of course, you and Dom in particular, I think you often used to lead parades when you were with us, or you were sort of like outriders, or you didn't have to stay with a section, did you?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
No, we didn't.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
As you say, you were about constant movement.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Yes, definitely.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I mean, I think it was a more of a scene or a, I don't know, let's see, a parade of such for us to run basically up and down the whole length of the carnival.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
It can't tie us down to one place, you know what we like to do.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:29.000
You know, it brought a little bit of excitement to it because not only was obviously the general public viewing each section in a stage, but then sort of saw us, I suppose, as a bit of the jesters just running around making a muck.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Well, you had that wild card feel about with you, which is that you didn't have to relate to one set of music or one group or one set of costumes.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
No, definitely not.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
You were like our guardians or our pioneers.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And how often you were at the front, I seem to remember, helping sort of, you know, almost like...

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
To clear the way, I think.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
To clear the way.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Move.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Bounce, bounce, bounce.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And also probably out in the front was the only place because this is, I mean, entirely to your credit, you and Dom, but even during the course of a parade, you would still find times.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And perhaps that's because you were out in the front and we had to stop for road closings and whatever.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I remember if we could clear a space of how much do you normally leave, about 50 meters or something like that?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Yeah, something along that.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You could run up, don't you?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I mean, yeah, we're there by the side of Howells.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
There's hundreds of people around.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
This is the one I like.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I don't know why it stays with me because of the sound flash.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
How did it feel performing to that number of people in the middle of town during a parade on a sunny day?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
We did have them occasionally.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Yes, we did.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Yeah, living in Wales, surprisingly.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
We create the atmosphere of, you know, and everything from the run up of the crowd going, ooh, to, you know, yeah.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
What did it feel like?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Well, before we even get to that bit, I mean, I think it's just worth to mention that we had a small group of us on that particular day.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I think there was about six of us.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And I'd actually gone on holidays just before this parade and left it to my good friends to come up with a design for a costume for the lot of us.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And I ended up coming back to the most flamboyant boiler suit ever, I believe,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
with purple sequins and whatnot, courtesy of Adrian.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And but yeah, so anyway, with all of that on, looking slightly tanned as well from my holiday, going back to that moment, performing all the way up from I think it was from City Hall, making our way around the route, getting to that point of towels.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Enough was enough for me.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I needed to sit down and to have a bit of a break and it turned into a little spectacle, I think.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Masses of crowds around us and that small little corridor by howls.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And I mean, the atmosphere was just amazing because Dom was performing, ended up doing front flips over me, jumping with me stood up.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So, you know, that was me being nearly seven foot, probably seven and a half foot on stilts.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
With the stilts on.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Yeah, with the stilts on.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
He's tall anyway.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Yeah.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And Dom, you know, jumping straight over me, sort of straddling me.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:11.000
The crowd just going nuts, obviously, because they could just see the, it doesn't matter how far away they were with us stood up at seven foot with Dom jumping nine foot up in the air.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
It just attracted crowds of people.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And then the girls performing the sort of can-can dance and little sequence of other little tricks and whatnot.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
It was just amazing.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And all it was was a little break.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
That's what it did.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
It was our little break just to sort of have five.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
The crowd went wild, didn't it?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I mean, proper full on cheering and chanting and sort of, you know, that whole willy wonky do it dance stuff.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I mean, talk about, you know, sitting on the edge of your seat, you know, you would sort of start with either a run up and then tease the crowd, obviously run back, go again or just sort of.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Just sort of jump there for a couple of seconds.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
You know, is he going to go?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Is he not, you know, to build up the momentum?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And I think at one point we even had the crowd do the sort of drum roll.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And then when it did happen, it was a big, massive cheer of like, whoa, it was amazing, amazing sort of atmosphere to be in.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And then moving off then to the next bit.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Absolutely.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So what can I say other than it's been a joy talking to you.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I wish at this point to award the invisible mythical but entirely worthwhile award of Cardiff Parliament Hero to Jeeves.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And I'm sure you're going to pass on some of this award to Dom.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Oh, my class a fraction.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
You're like a dynamic duo.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
It was Jeeves and Dom.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
It was. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
So you're in this Jeeves.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I hear about you play your car hero.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Thank you very much indeed.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Thank you very much.
