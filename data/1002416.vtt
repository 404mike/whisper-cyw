00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
If you'll remain standing, we'll sing the Star-Spangled Banner.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
Boy, they give it one note.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:22.500
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Whose bright stars and bright stars through the perilous fight,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.500
O'er the ramparts we watched, and the bombs bursting in air,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:48.500
And the bombs bursting in air, O'er the ramparts we watched, and the bombs bursting in air,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:58.500
O'er the ramparts we watched, and the bombs bursting in air,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:16.500
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
Thank you very much.
