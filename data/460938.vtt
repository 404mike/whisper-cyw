00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
What has had the greatest impact on you?

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.520
I mean on screams, it would have been probably around the time of the coronation, it would have

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:23.840
been the pictures of Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing climbing Everest. Because my mother

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:32.320
reckons anyway that as soon as I could crawl I started to climb. But that gave it a kind of

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:43.600
focus. It seemed a proper thing to do, the kind of thing that men did. And as a very, very young

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.960
boy, I mean I was six when Everest was first climbed. You know, mountain climbing was always

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:00.160
something I wanted to do then. So that was very important. I think the news has always been very

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.480
important to me, that's what I forgot to tell you. I'm a terrible news junkie, not as bad as I used

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.480
to be, nothing like as bad as I used to be. And I don't like 24-hour rolling news, I hate it.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.320
Because I think it distorts what we do, I think it has a huge effect on our behaviour.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.160
But there are a lot of things that I've watched on the news that have had a big impact on me.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.520
The reports from Vietnam, you know, really the first live reports

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:43.840
streamed from battlefields, they had a big effect on me. And in a way, news was always an extension,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.800
PathÃ© news that I used to watch in Aberdare. I mean Aberdare was a town that had a lot of cinemas,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.560
and I used to go to the cinema a lot. I can remember the very first film that my mother took us to see,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.520
my mother loved the cinema, and she took us to see, I think she was probably quite unhappy in

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:17.120
Aberdare for quite a long time, because she was a my stage girl. And the first film I can

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:25.040
never remember going to see was Samson and Delilah with Victor Matheur and Hedy Lamarr.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.680
Who was stunning, by the way, she really was amazing. Victor Matheur wasn't much of an actor,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.200
but he had great pectoral muscles. A lot of me said that.
