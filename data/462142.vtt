00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
It was a bit of a hoo-har about it, which you know, I can understand people who felt

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.400
very strongly about it being Auntie, but really, you know, for us it was just a bit of fun

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.400
almost, you know, it was not particularly anything to do with Welshness, it was just

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.400
entertainment really. I remember walking over the bridge, there was an old bridge there

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.560
before that one, and there was some young child in front of me walking along singing

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.240
God bless Prince of Wales. Now he obviously had no idea what he was singing and he had

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.320
no idea where he'd learnt it, but I came in and I said, well I thought you wouldn't

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.320
believe what I just heard, I said it was really funny, I said, I found it was, you know, well

00:00:50.400 --> 00:01:01.400
just funny, I said, we watched it on the television, all the drama, and I seem to remember there

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.720
must have been something going on somewhere in Anasir, because this elderly lady walking

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.240
up the road in full Welsh costume, this was the one and only time I've ever seen a person

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.240
wear the full regalia and the hat, the shawl, and she obviously hadn't bought it for that

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.240
particular occasion, where she had had it from, I don't know, but she must have had

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.880
it for years, and she was wearing it, she was obviously going somewhere, I don't know

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.880
whether she was in a choir or what, but I thought, my goodness, I've never seen that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.880
before, so it was, yeah, there were all sorts of things, but yeah, I mean, personally I

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.880
don't think it meant a lot really, not to me personally, just entertainment.
