00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Firstly, let us say thank you to Heritage Lottery in Wales for enabling us to bring you these podcasts.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.500
My name is Jamie Baker and I am part of Horn Development Association, HDA, in Cardiff.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.500
And this site, Black Diverse and Welsh, is intended to bring together lots of initiatives

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.000
that we've been involved in in terms of Black and Diverse people in Wales.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.500
But most immediately, a series of episodes, a series of contributions, which are about Cardiff.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:47.500
And if you sit outside the Norwegian Church on the bay in Cardiff and in better times have a cup of coffee,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:56.500
hopefully this series of podcasts over the next few months will give you an idea what that place you're looking at used to be,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:06.500
what's happened there and what it represents to the people who live or lived in the streets you, to a large extent, can't see anymore.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
And this is Matthew Reed.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.500
For me, I was not born at the tidal bay era. I'm more Buteone.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.500
My family's lived in Buteone for Tiger Bay for over 100 years.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.500
My great-grandfather came over from St. Kitts. My grandfather came over from America as a GI.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.500
That's on my mother's side. On my father's side, my great-grandfather came over from Cape Verde or Cape Verde.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:43.500
And that's sort of my little bit of melting pot of being a descendant of the Tiger Bay area, if that makes any sense,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.500
of what Tiger Bay brought to not only Wales but to the world.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.500
Truly, you represent the multiculturalism of the...

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500
There's only one United Nations.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:08.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So for me, like I said, my mother's father was a GI from Cincinnati who came here and married my grandmother,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:17.500
but they ended up splitting up. My father's father's father, Philip, was from Cape Verde.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.500
My great-grandfather on my mother's side is from St. Kitts.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.500
And my grandmother, who he married, was half Egyptian and half English.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.500
So for me, I've got a lot of mixed blood inside me.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.500
But like I said, in Buteone or maybe even in Tiger Bay at one point, there were many religions and many colours and creeds

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.500
living in this one area, but still everybody had a respect for everybody's religion.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:50.500
Whether people choose to believe that religion is real or not, the respect was still here in Buteone as a multicultural society

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.500
or as a multicultural path, the most multicultural path of Canada.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.500
And through me going to Mount Stewart Primary School and having Betty Campbell as my headmistress, I will put down to her,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.500
that lady there, if it weren't for her, I'm not saying I would have a different aspect on life,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.500
but through the unlimited assemblies and clans and religions we celebrated in school,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.500
we were all sort of made to respect each other's religion, culture, creed.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.500
And that's one of the benefits of coming from Tiger Bay and Buteone.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.500
People talk about Betty Campbell in a really, really special way.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.500
Yeah, because she was, someone said, a trailblazer yesterday.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.500
So yeah, she did lead the way for Black mixed race teachers or for just teachers in general.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.500
The lady, she had a strong mind, the boas, and she delivered.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.500
And like I said, through me living in Buteone, I do have a respect for culture and respect in that aspect.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.500
So I am thankful that I went to that school.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.500
Living in Buteone at the time, it was a different era.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.500
Like I said, it was before the phones, not pre-computer games,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.500
because living in the 80s, we were all Americanized.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.500
We all had our skateboards at the same time.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.500
We all had our roller skates at the same time.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500
We all had our bikes at the same time.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.500
So when it was Christmas, we were all out in the square playing on our bikes, playing football.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500
Now it's a different world.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.500
Now kids are all online, texting and everything else.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.500
And a part of me, when I look at Buteone now, it's like a part of Buteone has died for me,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.500
because when they took the lung out of Buteone, which was Angeline Street,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.500
for me that was the lung with over maybe, I'm not sure if there was eight maids and exes there.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.500
I couldn't tell you how many maids and exes there was,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.500
but just to think that when there was over maybe 20 families, maybe even more, that lived in each maids and exes.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.500
So when you're taking out eight maids and exes with 20 plus families living in these maids and exes,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:04.500
you're taking a big portion of Buteone to renovate it and to put people in now who I believe don't understand

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.500
that the area they inherited is probably the most culturalist part of Canada.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:18.500
And it's sad to see that the maids and exes that we used to run through and chase and whatever are gone.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.500
And like I said, with that, the memories of Buteone, I'm not saying Buteone is dead,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.500
but what I am saying is the history of that era is gone.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.500
What I had is gone. What the old ones in the 70s had is gone.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500
There's no pubs up there no more.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.500
In fact, there's one pub in Buteone or on the Bay or whatever you want to call it,

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.500
is the packet, probably one of the longest, probably one of the oldest pubs without a name change.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.500
That makes sense.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.500
So that's the only the last standing pub in Buteone and it's the packet.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:03.500
So whatever agenda is being or agenda kind of development has on Buteone, it's worked, unfortunately.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.500
But there is still a community there.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:15.500
We see the community come out recently from Hamon the Ravage in the case ongoing at the moment

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.500
with regards to him and South Wales police.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.500
That shows me that there's still a community there.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.500
They are Dutong, that they want to understand what's going on.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:32.500
But like I said, I do believe that some people who inherited Dutong now just don't understand

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.500
the historical aspects of that place there.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:44.500
Like I said, if it were for cows and a dog, then there wouldn't be no transport, you know, whatever.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:51.500
And with the transport, it obviously brought the people into Buteone or Tiger Bay at that time.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.500
We then settled down and they found it.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:02.500
One question I'd ask, mate, is would Cardiff be the capital of Wales without the docks?

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.500
Where would the money have come from?

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:16.500
I would like to know, yeah, obviously, Cardiff was obviously the leading import or export of coal.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.500
And obviously with that, because we've got capital status.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.500
And I'm not taking it away from Cardiff or the docks, but maybe we could have got the status

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.500
due to us having a cathedral in our city.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:35.500
So maybe we've got a city in a city and maybe that might have attracted attention as well as the docks.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:43.500
But yeah, I do believe the docks in itself are the financial apparatus, would you say?

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.500
Well, yeah, and if you think about the docks, maybe financially drove Cardiff.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.500
Well, who drove the docks? It's the people you're talking about.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:08:01.500
Exactly. And especially having, you could call it the Welsh Wall Street down in the Bay, which was the coal exchange.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:09.500
And yeah, it's nice to think how on a level or how far advanced Cardiff was at that time

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:15.500
with regards to the shit and quality of people that used to come to Cardiff.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:22.500
How everything went electric, that was it. Dead. No more.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:30.500
It's a bit like a motor city. It's like Detroit, when everything just went a bit and they started losing and losing money.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.500
And now you see Detroit, Detroit is what it is.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:42.500
It shambles and it's lucky that they've been able to use whatever ugliness they took to the beauty, so to speak.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:48.500
And it was an ugliness in the dollars. And as we see the docks now, that's what the docks is.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.500
A multi-billion pound franchise, or multi-million pound business.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:09:00.500
And it's just sad that people have had to be sacrificed in that process.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.500
But it feels always different in the 80s. We had the youth club, Chalky White.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:12.500
I remember being in the van with Elvin Blades and someone said to me,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.500
Chalky White has just passed away. And I was really young. I remember that one image.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:24.500
I wasn't again, I was Butow, but I was more of, I weren't Tiger Bay era, if that makes sense.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:32.500
I'm 43 nearly in October. So yeah, that's one of my earliest recollections of Chalky White.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:39.500
People speak about Chalky White and his effect on them when they were kids.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.500
I crossed a long span.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:50.500
Yeah, but I was more of the Steve Kyra era. The Algerian Foster, Mr. Foster as we used to call him.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:58.500
Sheila Haddie, Frankie Ammon, Frankie Norman. So I was that sort of moniker on a Wednesday.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.500
I'd sneak into the club to pretend I was dancing, just to not dance and play on the floor.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:07.500
So that was how we used to sneak in on a Wednesday. They used to do dance lessons on a Wednesday.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:16.500
You pretend you're dancing and then what do you do then? You just go up and then you go play pool or table tennis or watch a film or whatever.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:23.500
But yeah, we were sort of a different era then. It was nice. It was a real community at its best.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:29.500
And yeah, fair play to Steve Kyra because Steve did his best for us when we were kids.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.500
He took us, took us always trying to do our best.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:40.500
I remember when he turned to my mum and he said, oh look, we're doing a run up with the Canada Devils.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.500
Does your boy want to come and train or do this and do that?

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:50.500
And we were going up at the corporate events and we were allowed to go in there for free.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:57.500
Obviously we had the name drop, etc. But yeah, the Six Week Holidays in the youth club was the best.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:04.500
I couldn't think of anywhere else I'd want to be on the Six Week Holidays in school or out of school.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.500
And yeah, the Six Week Holidays youth club was the one for me at that time.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.500
Do you think we miss those youth clubs?

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:18.500
Well, that's the one reason why kids aren't paying attention properly at the moment because they don't know what a youth club is.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.500
No kids these days know what a youth club is.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:27.500
I think because the financing was there to keep kids at bay or to give kids something to do

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:35.500
or try and get something like to try and find what the kid likes to then maybe channel that positive energy out of the kid

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:41.500
to maybe nurture that kid and try and make him become that thing he wants to be.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.500
It doesn't matter what it is, but there were places for that and there's no places like that at the moment.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:51.500
So right now kids know about street selling drugs, carrying knives and whatever culture comes with that.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.500
That's not a street element at the moment.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.500
And it's sad. 13 year old kids shouldn't be on the street selling drugs.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:02.500
They should at least be in a youth club doing 13 year old things.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:12.500
The things have elevated so far from being in a youth club at maybe 10, 11 years of age to now 10, 11 years of age.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.500
They're more on the street selling drugs.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:21.500
I remember I was in Barrie. My family are from Barrie.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:27.500
I can remember when I used to go over to the bay, used to go out with the boys in the bay in the 80s.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:35.500
Everybody was into something that was healthy and physical, whether it was boxing, martial arts.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.500
Yeah, yeah. Because I'm a caddiff.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.500
Yeah, I'm a caddiff and the doctor and the specialist was speaking about it to somebody.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:52.500
The amount of people, whether they were black or white, that come from that kind of caddiff who didn't get a fair shot, who really were something.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.500
You get what I'm saying? They were like people like...

00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:00.500
You look at the kayaks and you think everyone was afraid to play them.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.500
Yeah, this is where I was going to go to. This is where I was going to go to. The kayaks.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.500
They were famous. They were famous around wherever.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:17.500
People knew that the kayaks were to be true. You can't beat the kayaks. If you do, then you're done.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.500
But yeah, the kayaks, they were a formidable team.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:29.500
And like I said, people like Sammy Jones, up until like Gerald Zerlis, they've had some top players play for them.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.500
But players, you should have been playing professional rugby, whether it was league or union, it doesn't matter.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:40.500
There was a lot of people there that shouldn't have been playing for Wales, you could say. Maybe, I don't know.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:49.500
Well, I was in Maisteg, Bridgend, the other day and someone said to me, do you know caddiff, I said yes.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:57.500
Big old white guy and he said, my Maisteg Rugby Club, we used to be afraid to play the kayaks.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:07.500
But what a party, what a friendly group of people. If you played them, you also had the time of your life.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:13.500
Yeah, because at the end of the day, whatever's on the pitch is left on the pitch.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:22.500
And it's good that people can show other people from out of any way that they're past, future,

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.500
that people can be accommodating and friendly and non-judgmental.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:35.500
And I do think sometimes people who maybe didn't want to play the kayaks, I'm not saying they were racist or maybe they were scared or whatever.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:43.500
But maybe they just had this thing in their head that when they were going to go down there, they were going to get burned at the stake or something in their head.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:49.500
Maybe that was the fear factor, maybe that was the fear factor going into the ghetto and playing.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.500
Obviously they were afraid of going somewhere with them up.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:15:00.500
Yeah, just that thought of coming to Caddiff and then leaving there, taking the rooms and then going back to the pub and then apparently drinking and eating food.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.500
That's a good memory. No violence.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:11.500
He said that someone from the team, a couple of people from the team, said to him, stay later.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:20.500
And they took him to a club in Butetown, in the bay, that used to be a church.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.500
Yeah, that was the Casablanca.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.500
But they'd never been to a place like it.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.500
I can imagine, I can imagine, I can imagine, I can imagine what it felt like when they walked in.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:36.500
You know, he said, I'd never heard Reggae before. Whoa!

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.500
Yeah, I bet he didn't forget Reggae either.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:49.500
No, that was the point. And I was saying to him, you like Reggae. And he was rolling off people's names. It's clear that that stuck with him forever then.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what's good about breaking people down as well.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.500
Like, because people could have a stereotype on you.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:08.500
But then it's like, once you get to know somebody, they may be your thoughts on somebody could just immediately just be like, perhaps I've made a stupid decision all my life.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:14.500
I'm hating on this one person or this one person because of what he looks like or because of who he is.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.500
But immediately being brought down by humbleness and hospitality.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:28.500
And I do think that can work. So I'm probably just breaking people down. It can be done, but it's how it's done.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:36.500
And obviously, because rugby is more nonviolent compared to football.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.500
So I do believe sometimes it's a mentality thing as well.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.500
But I'm not saying anybody like with any anybody from football would have done anything to it.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.500
But what I'm saying is I just find the mentality a little bit different.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:59.500
I mean, when all said and done, this is an old white guy walking up to an old black guy in the middle of a small town near Bridge End.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:07.500
And he's not worried about asking me questions. And you know, people walk around you in some places.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:14.500
OK, and that was because of his experience with the kayaks and the people from it.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.500
Yes. Yes.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.500
What about what about music? You know, music.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.500
What do you remember about going out?

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:35.500
Well, for me, it was more you had your places like the Baltimore, the Paradise Club.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.500
The Paradise was a thing run on a Sunday.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.500
Well, it was not on every day, but the main day would be Sunday.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.500
Obviously, it would be on Saturday and Friday.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:51.500
But, yeah, the Paradise Club was a haunt for South Caddiff.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:18:00.500
For most people who were connected in with that old day tradition of yelling and etc.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.500
So it was a place for where people could go to, so to speak, on a Sunday.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.500
And that would be the haunt for people to go to.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.500
Casablanca, I was too young for Casablanca.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.500
I went to a party there, a friend's birthday party there.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.500
Other than that, no, I never went to the Casablanca.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.500
Other venues in Caddiff.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.500
Yeah, I'm from a different area, that's what I'm saying.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.500
So places for me were only the Baltimore.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.500
Not the Baltimore.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.500
Well, the Baltimore was open on a Sunday as well.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.500
You had the Irish place on the corner as well, which was open on a Sunday round jam.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.500
That's why I don't understand.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.500
All these pubs were.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.500
Look, I once heard a pub down on the corner.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.500
McHugh's?

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.500
No, McHugh's was a pub.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.500
It was up in the Fighting Irish logo on the outside.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.500
Oh, I know what you mean.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.500
It's in Longstreet Square.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.500
It might have been McHugh's, mate.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.500
So you had that pub there pumping full of people.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.500
Andy Babges across the road.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.500
You had the Shippin' Pilots around the corner.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.500
And the way you had the packet.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:17.500
And literally, all these pubs are now dead.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.500
Dead.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.500
People are struggling.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.500
Gentrified, the other pubs.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.500
You can get a meal, you can't get a live band.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.500
Yeah, well that's what's become of living in Caddiff.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.500
Because it's like, they're only going for one type of people.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.500
Obviously it's the fancy dress brigade.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:46.500
The fancy dress brigade, like the hen party and the stag party.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.500
They want to accommodate their mountain Caddiff.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.500
And not keep Caddiff traditions.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.500
Once they took the, what's the pub in Caddiff in Tom Mow?

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.500
The Market Cavern?

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.500
Yeah, I know the market.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.500
No, no, no, no, no.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.500
Once they changed the number that River Cavern was,

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.500
I was like, no, that's it, we're done.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.500
It's officially done.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.500
Because that sign didn't need to be changed in my eyes.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:16.500
I know it's only a small thing, but all these new signs that they've got up on these new pubs now,

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.500
they look terrible, they look cheap.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.500
And literally it's just become like you said, the gentrification of houses, pubs.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.500
Everything has to look a certain way.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:29.500
It's got to be a second we're pleading to a certain individual.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.500
So unfortunately, we're going to pay the piper for it.
