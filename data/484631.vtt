00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.880
Interviewer, Steve Fletcher.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.840
Interviewee, Sophia Kahn.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.800
Location of interview, Swicker Office.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.080
Today's date is the 12th of October, 2015.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.000
Sophia, before we start, would you be kind enough

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.320
for the record to spell your name in full?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.160
Yes, Steve.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.160
Sophia S-O-P-H-I-A, Kahn, K-H-A-N.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.440
That's fantastic.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.240
So, when did you first, and how did you first

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.200
make contact with the Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.040
It was through my steel pan teacher at the time, Wadda.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.840
I was 14 and I'd been playing steel pans for him.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.800
Actually, he'd been teaching me in school,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.240
and then he got me and my friend involved

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.320
in Cardiff Carnival.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.160
That's fantastic.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.560
Were you at Fitzhallen High School

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.000
or were you?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.520
No, I was in Lamb Remney High.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.360
Got it.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.200
In Lamb Remney.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.440
And of course, for those who don't know

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.120
and for future posterity, Wadda, his official name,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.240
Hubert Placide, is from the wonderful Caribbean island

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.560
of St. Lucia, and I had the pleasure of meeting him

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.560
for the first time in 1991 when Swicker was based

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.520
in Channelview Leicester Centre down in Grangetown

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.040
when I had a knock on the office door

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.080
and Mike Johnson, who ran the centre, said,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.040
I've just had somebody pop in from the Caribbean

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.600
who's wondering if there's any bar work,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.960
but he plays steel pans.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.200
And that was, he introduced me to Wadda,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.200
and way back then we brought the first set of steel pans

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.760
and put him on wage, and that's when he began

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.800
teaching steel pan, primarily in schools, back in 1991.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.760
And here we are in 2002, and he's introduced you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.040
to Cardiff Carnival, you're playing pan regularly.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.080
Can you remember a little bit about your record

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.920
as a panist, a pan man, woman in pan?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.400
We couldn't decide pan player, we couldn't decide

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.680
what to call you in our preamble.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.520
Yes, take a-

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.440
Pan person.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.920
Pan person, I like it.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.920
Well, yeah, so the area of Cardiff, which I'm from,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.680
we didn't know about Cardiff Carnival at all,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.640
and it was a new thing to us.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.640
So yeah, Wadda told my friends and I about it.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.400
And yeah, he brought us down on the,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.960
I think it was a launch party,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.800
so we could have a look around.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800
And this would be to the Butown Youth Pavilion?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.640
Butown Youth Pavilion, yeah.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.680
Excellent, down the docks.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.520
And yeah, from there, my friend Nina Kiaga,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.320
who's been involved for a long time,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.040
we both got involved at the age of 14.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.520
And yeah, Wadda was a great mentor, he was a great teacher.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.600
And he, oh, from that day, from that time,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.600
we had gone on then to do street parades in Carmarthen,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.920
and then we started doing Swansea Carnival as well.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.760
Excellent.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.840
So he kind of linked us in from there

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.280
to do other youth projects.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.080
And I'm right in thinking, Cardiff Carnival 2002,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.600
the steel pan was performed not on the back of a lorry,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.720
not walking with your pan set inside a float,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.680
but it was actually a Caribbean format

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.440
called Pan Round the Neck.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.040
And I remember the carnival team,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.680
and certainly Wadda giving us instructions

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.320
as to how to make the backpacks

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.040
to hang the steel pans off

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.000
so that they're in front of you and you're there playing.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.040
You mentioned that Wadda gave you some very good advice

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.440
in the event that you were to drop your pan sticks

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.800
whilst on parade.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.360
What was his advice to you?

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.800
So yeah, he said, if we drop our sticks,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.680
there's no way we can pick them up again.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.480
And it was nice because you'd always have someone

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.240
running behind you, giving you water.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.640
They would pick your sticks up.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.640
But we had, well, other weeks leading up to carnival,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.360
we could decorate our backpacks.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.280
So we'd use straps of material

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.280
to wind around the shoulders and the harness.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.040
And we'd kind of make pockets to put extra sticks in.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.080
So we could just grip them out.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.520
Kind of like a drummer when they've got spare sticks

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.720
in their back, like a little backpack.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.640
I was thinking of more of an archer actually

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.560
reaching for his bow and arrows behind him

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.240
when he did that.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.120
It was like, next one, you know.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.240
Bish bash bosh.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.760
And I mean, you know, Wadda taught in a way

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.760
that everyone can play, even when people would say,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.560
oh, you know, I'm not musically minded at all

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.600
and I have no rhythm.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.600
Wadda's got a gift that anyone, anyone of any background,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.240
any walk of life, the kids, he, like, you could play pans.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.240
He'd teach you in such a way that would liberate you

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.520
and make you feel that, you know, basically,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.360
like when you're there on the pan, you were invincible.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.680
But in a good way.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.520
In a good way.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.360
And I mean, you know, especially for, you know,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.360
at the time I just lost my father and for a girl of 14,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.200
that was the best therapy anyone could ever give to me.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.600
And, you know, and I always take my hat off to Wadda

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.440
and he'll always hold a dear place in my heart

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.640
because, yeah, he opened up a door to me

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.000
that I never knew existed.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.280
And did you start off on bass pans,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.280
which of course are six full oil drums on the floor?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.120
Yeah.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.280
One person playing six drums has always,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.120
I've always thought that person is just like,

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.680
yeah, the way they swivel around.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.040
Yeah, when I started playing, it was eight drums.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.560
Wow.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560
With you in the centre.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.080
Yeah, sometimes it's eight, sometimes it's six.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.920
Right.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.360
So yeah, I started playing bass, bass drum.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.080
That's where I was.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.760
And then I moved on to,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.120
but when I played in Carnival, I started on guitar.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.960
Right.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.920
So when you're walking with a pan, they get condensed down.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.720
So guitars usually two pans,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.520
but when you're walking, it turns into one.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.920
A pan round the neck, it's gotta be one.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.760
Yeah.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.920
And then as time went on,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.920
I moved on to tenor,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.160
which is kind of like the vocals of the band.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.000
Yeah.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.960
Which was amazing.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.800
It's perfect.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.640
It is.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.720
It was nice to be able to play,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.840
you know, a few different parts in the pan orchestra.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.680
Yes.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.520
So yeah.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.360
Fantastic.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.720
When Wada was leading the pan round the neck group on Parade,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.560
would he be playing pan or would he be on a cowbell

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.680
with a whistle at the front, giving you the basic rhythm?

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.520
Well, he's facing you, isn't he?

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.520
He's facing, like Samba Galeas,

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.680
their musical director faces the players,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.160
as his back to the audience.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.320
So at times he'd either be on a snare.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.160
Right.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.000
So he'd be playing snare.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.760
Yeah.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.960
Or he'd be on a whistle with a cowbell.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.920
Yeah.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.200
But Wada would be getting involved.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.120
He'd always have a set of sticks on him.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.880
So he'd just like jump in and you'd be playing pan.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.720
On your pan?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.560
Brilliant.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.360
He'd play like, you know, an extra few notes.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.440
And it was nice because he would get involved.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.120
It wasn't just like, okay, I'm the, you know,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.960
I'm beating this.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.800
Yeah.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.920
He'd really get involved.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.760
And he'd always pick the parts.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.600
Like the icing on the cake.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.440
Yeah.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.760
Even when the years, it would rain so much.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.600
Yes, yes.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.720
It would be really hard to play your pan.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.560
You'd have to keep tipping it out.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.480
Let's talk about, yeah, so you literally had to,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.600
I can remember when, you know,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.600
when we knew that the forecast was bad,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.720
that amongst our shopping lists for the day would be

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.440
huge amounts of, the most absorbent kitchen roll

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.960
we could think of.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.160
Because for a nanosecond, we could wipe the pans

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.360
and you'd be back to where you started.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.560
But I mean, so you came on, what can be called

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.720
a few of the deluge years.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.360
Yeah, I think the worst year was when

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.360
we first got put on a float.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.200
Right.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.280
Did it have a roof on it or not?

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.920
No, it didn't have it.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.800
We learned to put roofs on them eventually.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.640
Yeah.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.320
And it was the year that we were down the oval basin.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.160
Right.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.280
And they had all the decking.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.080
So the bag got really, really slippery.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.960
All the Samba girls had to take their heels off

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.320
because they couldn't dance on it at all.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.160
Yeah.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.400
And yeah, it was literally,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.280
it was really hard to play any songs.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.400
Why do I care if our spirits are up?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.760
Our face painted, washed away.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.360
We kind of looked like drowned rats.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.120
But happy carnival drowned rats.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.360
Yeah, it was happy.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.480
And I just remember every two minutes

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.080
having to empty my pan of water and gather up the rest.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.720
This is steel panning Wales, folks.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.680
You know, the truth behind the...

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.840
But it was fun.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.040
It was fun.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.400
I can remember the audience's reaction

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.640
because we don't hear as much steel panning Wales

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.920
as perhaps we ought to do, you know,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.360
so that when there is a chance to hear it in a public...

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.240
For me, I can always tell where the pan band was

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.480
because there's something about that music

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.080
that seems to touch everybody.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.360
You know, that really, you could tell.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.640
There'll be smiles and cheers

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.720
and you just know where the pan band was passing

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.800
at that point.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.280
I never saw people turn...

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.000
Yeah, it seems to me that steel pan has a universality

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.240
and an uplifting...

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.080
There's something about it that brings out the best

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.480
in the audience as well.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.520
Steel pan has got the ability.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.480
I mean, every instrument has got the ability.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.680
When it's played and played right,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.200
you know, it can touch everyone.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.320
You know, it does.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.960
It touches your soul.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.960
But steel pan has got the ability

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.400
for someone who thinks they can't play an instrument

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.880
to be able to play it and feel like a virtuoso.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.360
And I think...

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.840
So it's really accessible, basically.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.040
Yeah, and it's got such a life to it.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.120
And it's, you know, at the end of the day, it's an oil drum.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.520
A guitar is made in a way it is crafted.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.520
And even though a pan is made,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.160
it's...

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.560
Yeah, it's kind of...

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.400
It has.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.800
It's made the same way as guitars,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.240
it's got all the love and, you know,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.960
all the devotion in it.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.600
But it's a drum at the end of the day.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.560
It's an oil drum.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.400
It's an oil drum.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.200
It was used and then it's been recycled into something

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.160
that makes the most beautiful sound

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.800
that you'd never think would come out of an oil drum.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.200
And yeah, as soon as you play

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.200
and you see the reaction of the people,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.560
yeah, it just makes you want to play more.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.760
And it takes you to a place.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.600
And especially as a child, you know,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.000
it takes you to a place which you don't even know exists

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.880
and it lets your imagination free.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.560
So your carnival history began as a pan player, a panist.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.920
Other members of your family were also involved

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.320
in Cardiff Carnival in different respects.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.720
As musicians, as dance tutors,

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.320
and I suppose everyone gets involved in the making.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.960
So after several years with Wadda and the Steel Pan Group,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.440
playing pan around the neck,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.440
we get to as late as Cardiff Carnival, 2011, Magic.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.320
And there was a very, very popular, in fact, yes,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.560
I think it started off relatively small,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.440
the American Indian section.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.360
And you ended up making your first ever

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.000
queen costume on a backpack.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
What was that like?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.480
Well, I didn't wear the backpack, but-

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.960
You designed it, you made it?

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.720
I had-

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.320
You plucked those chickens?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.160
Yeah, well-

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.040
Little balled chickens in China is all I can say.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.440
Yeah, Adrian gave me an unlimited supply of feathers.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.000
And wire.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Right.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And yeah, I made my first headdress, big headdress.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.160
Yes.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.320
Was there any glue gunning involved?

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.320
Because I always associate the smell of burning human flesh

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.160
with the carnival camp.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.440
Yeah, it was a lot of burning flesh.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.240
It was a lot of glue gunning.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.080
Excellent.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.080
Pastor Bernie's, that's a-

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.120
Yeah, and it was, yeah, it was brilliant.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.200
It was the first year that I got involved dancing.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.120
And I would have done pans if Wazza had been involved.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.600
And it was quite, yeah, it was quite hard for me

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.240
because I wasn't gonna get involved in the first place.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.240
Because, yeah, my heart lied with the pans.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.160
Right.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.800
And yeah, so it was only because of my sister

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.440
that I got back and, well, I came back to carnival.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.560
Got it.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.240
And yeah, I had a really good time.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.760
It was, yeah, it was really good being able to dance

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.960
and not play pans.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.520
And the carnival camp would have been

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.320
at Channel View Leisure Center then.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.440
Yeah.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.800
Yeah, well, I remember on the one hand,

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.520
we were lucky to secure a big space

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.520
because we need lots of room.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.400
But did the lack of natural daylight in there

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.480
ever do your head in?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.040
It was a bit like going into sodium-lit hell

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.880
after a while, wasn't it?

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.440
Yeah, it was quite hard.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.760
But at the same time, I was used to working backstage

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.240
in theater so you don't have-

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.360
You don't need natural daylight or fresh air

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.160
or any of those vitamins or whatever.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.200
They're for whips.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.720
Yeah, but it was quite a change.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.480
I think in the pavilion, there was more of an atmosphere.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.800
Like that.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.040
It had been more than five.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.320
And certainly we had to park outside

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.160
when the weather was good.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.760
We could take work outside.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.160
Which was really nice.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.160
So Channel View was quite restricted in a way.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.320
And I think a lot of the public felt that as well.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.280
So I think maybe that's why you didn't get

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.600
as many participators as you normally would.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.800
Like that.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.480
Just because Carnival is built on vibe,

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.160
it's built on feeling, it's built on emotions.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.800
And workshop is exactly the same.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.560
So if there's something lacking in that,

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.160
then people go off feelings, they go off their vibe.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.920
And yeah, I think that's why maybe-

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.800
No, no, I can see, respect that.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.520
Yeah, maybe it hadn't hit the numbers

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.200
that everyone thought it was.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.920
But it was great.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.240
I had a good time and enjoyed everything.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.640
So if you decided to make the giant backpack

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.960
with unlimited feathers, I love that idea.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.800
That's a good name.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.160
That's a good name for a carnival company, isn't it?

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.480
Unlimited feathers.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.040
We might use that in the future.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.360
Were you in the American Indian section

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.800
when you were dancing on the parade or not?

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.640
Because you said you didn't play it.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.480
Yes.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.840
So you were around it and the rest of it.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.840
Yeah.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.640
And would your sister, Sakina Khan,

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.560
would she have dared to give you dance steps

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.400
or were you autonomous as a group?

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.240
Oh, no, no, no.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.800
Yeah, she gave us a really good choreography

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.720
and I'm not a dancer at all.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.600
I don't claim to be a dancer.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.600
But yeah, it went well with the music.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.200
And yeah, I think there was 40-

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.040
It grew and grew and grew.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.880
Yeah, it grew.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.960
It was a very popular section.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.520
So I think at times, she made it well.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.360
So the more it grew, the dance wasn't too complicated.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.120
It would still look good though.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.960
Excellent.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.920
She still pulled it off.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.080
And yeah, I had fun doing it.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.960
It was good.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.160
It was a good experience.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.080
Lovely.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.920
And the following year, of course,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.040
your brother was involved.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.880
Take us through that year.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.320
How did you get involved in the Blue Warriors, wasn't it?

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.160
I remember.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.320
I had a break from the tour I was on.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.760
So I came back to the UK

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.920
and I just popped down to say hello to everyone.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.960
And it was the only time I was gonna get to see-

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.520
It's like being press gang, this bit, isn't it?

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.360
Yeah, before-

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.080
It's like, well, you learned from that lesson, didn't you?

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.440
Yeah, and then I saw Asia in

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.440
and then Kath, the seamstress at the time.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.680
And they were like, oh, you should stay and help out.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.240
And I was like, oh, okay.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.560
So I was like, well, I've got a few weeks off from work.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.240
And then Misha and Naomi were there

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.280
and I hadn't seen them in a long time.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.600
And I just ended up getting involved

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.600
and I wasn't gonna do it.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.160
And I was like, oh, I wanted to break.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.920
It's like my time off from work.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.720
But yeah, I did.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.240
I had lots of fun with that.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.280
And it was a nice difference.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.840
It was a nice contrast from the previous year

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.960
with my sister.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.640
Yeah, so we were blue warriors there

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.480
and it was comfortable.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.480
The costumes were so comfortable.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.600
Yes, well, they were daisy cutters, big baggy trousers.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.800
Yeah, I could see the royal blue, royal blue color.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.520
Really beautiful, yeah.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.800
And the royal blue and silver,

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.000
they really stood out.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.360
They were really, really vibrant.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.680
The head pieces again were more,

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.680
I would just say that the masculine version.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.400
So you really could throw yourself around

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.600
if you weren't worried about something.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.600
Yeah, no, and it was nice.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.120
And Imran designed them in a way.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.200
So even though he didn't use feathers,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.440
the material he used, when it rained,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.320
it didn't damage the headdress at all.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.160
No.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.400
And it was really light on your head, really, really secure.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.360
To be honest, it was the first time in Carnival

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.800
that I'd worn a headdress, even when I was playing pans

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.240
and we'd have to wear head pieces.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.280
You didn't feel like you were wearing anything.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.600
So you could throw your head about,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.680
you could do big jumps in the air, big kicks,

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.960
and it stayed on your head.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.560
And it rained really bad that year.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.400
It did, yeah.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.240
It rained really bad.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.360
And it's perfect because it was like plastic.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.800
So it didn't even get wet.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.120
Your head didn't even get wet.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.880
So it's like wearing an umbrella.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.240
The perfect carnival headpiece in many ways.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.120
Before we go on to your most, so we've had Pam Blair,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.400
we've had Designing and Making, we've had Dancing.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.520
You really are a true carnivalist, I would say.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.600
And then before we get into, or perhaps your final role,

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.920
which was this summer in 2015, well, let's go there

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.760
and explain a little bit about what you've been doing

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.160
in the rest of your career, et cetera,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.400
because there's a point of contact, isn't there?

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.720
There's obviously, carnival is about pressure.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.760
It's about making whatever the resources,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.440
we try to make them go twice as far.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.600
We work in a mythical seventh gear.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.400
The whole project starts with a deadline,

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.880
before the clock's ticking from day one.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.080
And at the heart of that, we have the designer,

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.640
but their right-hand person is the seamstress,

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.440
the person who is overlooking the physical creation,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.040
the interpretation of all these designs, who's there.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.880
And you were the seamstress for Carder Carnival 2015.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.560
How emotionally ascarred are you, Sophia, by that?

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.880
That was a joke.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.200
Very emotionally ascarred.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.080
No, no, it's fine.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.160
She seems to be well.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.720
Yeah, well, my job as a seamstress anyway,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.680
and working in theater, and you know,

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.680
you've got deadlines on you constantly.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.080
So that was, so yeah, you live on a deadline.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.520
So yeah, I was, to be honest, I was quite fine with that.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.480
You look very much in your element.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.320
Yeah.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.040
And you had the right accessible, but authority as well,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.000
which is, I'm dealing with this person,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.960
so wait patiently, and you will have my attention.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.800
Yeah.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.000
And it seemed like a formula that everybody,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.360
by and large, understood, you know.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.720
I think that could show that it came from your background.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.240
I mean, I'm thinking you've worked,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.400
oh, that's a name drop.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.240
You worked on cruise ships,

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.360
but you also have worked as part of DreamWorks.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.880
Was that a year-long tour of Madagascar?

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.840
I was impressed.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.280
It was, yeah, so it was a year with DreamWorks.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.720
Well, actually, I worked with DreamWorks longer than a year

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.800
because I did Ice Age on Ice with them.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.680
Wow.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:23.360
Which was a cast of 44 people, 44 performers,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.840
and the same amount. Touring UK or internationally?

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.360
We did some parts in the UK,

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.160
and that was the whole setup and rehearsal dates.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.800
And then we went on to do a Germany tour,

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.520
and then once the Germany tour was finished,

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.640
I went on to set up Madagascar,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.000
and then I toured with Madagascar.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.440
We did a UK tour, which was amazing,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.960
and then we went on to do a Latin American tour,

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.720
which lasted almost a year in Latin America.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.400
Wow, hell of a life experience.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.000
So, yeah, it was a long time on the road.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
You know where the bodies are buried, don't you?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.960
You should see the smile on her face at this point.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.320
It's all coming back.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.240
So you took all that experience,

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.400
and you brought that to Cardiff Carnival in 2015.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.280
Well, tell us more.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.120
I mean, yeah, I mean, it was a...

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.040
Before that, I'd been working.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.240
I'd been doing a lot more with artists and dancers,

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:24.240
so I'd been working with various singers, pop stars.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.360
Care to drop a few names?

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.080
Probably shouldn't, but yeah,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.120
I was doing local crew wardrobe for a long time.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.400
Local crew meaning I traveled up and down the country

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.240
with it as well.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.440
Local to the UK.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.440
Yeah, I did, well, I started off,

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.080
I think the first big person that I'd worked for

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.560
was Lady Gaga.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.280
And I know I shouldn't be, I didn't...

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.120
My jaw just dropped.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.840
Well, I'm not, I wasn't really a fan of her music at all.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.680
I'm still not really.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.240
Not even Wadis' version of Poker Face on steel pan.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.680
Wadis' version, Poker Face was one

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.360
of my favorite songs to play.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.200
Excellent.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.040
It was one of my favorite songs to play.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.000
I always thought that was,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.320
when he played me that the first time,

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.040
I was just like, wow.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.520
Yeah, but Wadis could play,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.520
literally he could make any tune.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.200
I mean, even like country and western songs,

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.040
he'd like,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:16.880
I've heard.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.000
Convert those into a pan

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.600
and he'd make them sound better than the original.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.560
Yeah, and like I've done like people like from like

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.660
smaller like UK acts like Westlife and Alton John,

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.920
see how George Michael.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.360
Yeah.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.880
Peter Andre was probably the last person I'd worked with

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.400
before I went on and did.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.240
Got it.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.080
I made a career movie tomorrow.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:42.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.760
Music theater.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.600
And I went into theater.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.440
Got it, got it.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.720
But yeah, I mean, I've been,

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.960
yeah, I've been doing wardrobe

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.960
and seamstress work for quite a while.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:54.960
Got it, got it.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.800
Yeah.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.400
In terms of challenges this summer

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.440
at the 26th Cardiff Carnival,

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.240
was there anything when you were up against it,

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.560
was it time or whatever,

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.200
or was it all smooth?

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.360
There was anything good, bad or ugly,

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.360
what sort of comes to mind?

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.280
It's sort of like,

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.200
I do occasionally have to say,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.720
look, that's not going to work.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.560
Yeah.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.440
You know, because you're very much part

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.760
of the design process.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.680
And I think the thing is,

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.280
you know, we all have these images in our mind

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.120
that we want,

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.920
that you know, we want this to happen

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.960
and we want this to happen.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.920
And when you've just got one person making,

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.120
making,

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.880
because really I'm there to make all the base costumes

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.000
then they get embellished.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.880
But at times there's more work that I have to do

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.880
that the public can't do.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.320
So I have to do part of the embellishment.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.000
Yeah.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.280
But yeah, I mean, there was at times,

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.360
there was challenges.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.040
I think there were challenges for everyone really.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.440
It's a very pressurized situation.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.480
It's an art form that sort of invites that.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:00.880
Yeah.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.200
We're going to try really hard now to do something.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.040
Yeah.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.600
But I think, I think because of like,

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.720
because of my background and having to work quite,

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.680
quite quickly,

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.800
it was just kind of like a normal pace for me.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.640
Yeah.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.560
And to be honest, some, some days I was like, oh,

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.680
I think I'm working quite slow today.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.520
But I just-

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.360
Not that we would have noticed.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.040
I mean, you just seem to, you know.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.480
But I just think-

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.760
You seem to be so in your element.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.600
Every time I pass you, you just like-

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.240
Yeah, I'm quite, I'm like, you know,

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.200
when I've got my project at hand-

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.760
Sophia, sorted, Sophia, sorted.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.600
Just walk past her.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.440
I like her.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.680
She's clearly, yeah, this is a woman who's not,

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.800
who's, you know, she's not waving and drowning.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.640
Yeah.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.480
She's waving, you know.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.320
I think, you know, the day, like the day,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.440
the day I went in and Adrian and Jallian were like, right,

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:49.120
so there's machines, there's the material,

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.240
and this is your area.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.880
So just set it up how you, like, how you want it.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.720
So I did.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.920
Yeah.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.320
And I didn't know whether it was set up the right way

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.760
or how the seamstress did it the year before.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.440
There was no, there was no pass-over or handbook.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.120
No, no, you're free to do what's-

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.560
Which, which, you know, at first I was just like,

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.480
oh, okay, so that's why I kept asking questions.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.840
Like, okay, how, like, how do you guys do it?

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.080
Because, you know, when I go into a job,

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.080
there's like kind of, there's kind of like nonwritten rules

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.040
or kind of like a pass, like a pass-over book.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.880
Like, this is how, you know, guidelines.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.600
And then you just basically do what you want to do.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.880
But this was basically a free-for-all.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.720
So you just go in and just do what you do.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.640
Which in the end worked, worked well.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.360
And I think if I was to do it again,

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.760
then, you know, I definitely,

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.360
I know where to start from.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.120
And I know for a fact, if I was to do it again,

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.000
then I could probably make a lot more costumes

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.440
in the time that I had.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.160
And, and I know, you know,

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.120
I know how to organise my time a bit better.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:04.120
And I think as a, you know, it is a community project.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:10.040
And, and yeah, it was, it was, it was fun being,

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.640
it was nice being able to have the freedom

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.400
to get in and design, you know.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.280
And, and, and as well, like work, work with the,

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.240
with the community.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.080
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.880
It was, yeah, it was quite a fulfilling job.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.520
It's quite, it's quite a fulfilling role.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.840
And then, and then at times being able to just sit down

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.520
and have my cup of tea.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.880
So Sophia, I mean, it seems to me that you

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.360
and other members of your family,

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.800
have had an extraordinary history

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.880
in terms of Cardiff Carnival.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.000
What's nice is the way that you've come in

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.800
from so many different angles

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.600
and contributed so much over such a long period of time,

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.840
since you were 14.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.200
So starting as a steel pan player

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.400
and the very wonderful Wadda,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.600
moving on to design a huge backpack

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.240
and help with other costume construction.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.840
And then dancing alongside both your brother

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.560
and your sister as tutors.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:12.560
And then your final incarnation as El Supremo,

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.040
the seamstress who is the source.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.080
You remember slightly at the,

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.800
you're the hub at the center of a wheel, aren't they?

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.400
I mean, all roads led to you.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.160
And the seamstress is, what can I say, corner,

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.400
which expanded to quite rightly

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.720
to take over the space it needed.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.520
So I have no reservation whatsoever

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.920
in wholeheartedly awarding you the mythical

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.920
and entirely visible honor of Sophia Carn,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.200
you are indeed a Cardiff Carnival hero.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.200
Thank you very much.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.040
Thank you.
