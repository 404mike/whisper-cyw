00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
If you've never lived through a disaster, which I hadn't at this point, you didn't

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.360
see what was going to come and how long it was going to be and how bad things could get.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.480
And that's quite a, in hindsight, kind of view that things deteriorated.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.200
And this was the big thing about the Sea Empress that I wanted to express in my memories of

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.520
the history of the Sea Empress was that from a present point of view, you were living day

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.640
to day thinking things will get better and things only got worse.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.240
So as the team of the Wildlife Trust got together, phones were starting to ring off the hook.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.560
We were recognizing what was it that was going to be impacted.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.120
Once the story started unrolling, it was releasing oil into the environment, the marine environment.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.360
Anything could happen. So it was again trying to recognize is it going to be

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.640
impacted towards Skullman, Skullcombe and Ramsey? Is it going to hit the coastline?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.040
Is it going to go up the Haven, which we had nature reserves up the further up the Haven?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.200
Is it going to, you know, what is it, what's present? One of my roles was to actually go out

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.600
into the field and visually try and see what was happening, but also to meet down when they were

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:37.640
doing press releases. So they set up in Milford Haven a press room and it was on the Port Authority,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.080
one of their buildings, and they were starting to release information there that you could go

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.800
down there and find out. But we were also preparing information to try and highlight

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.800
why is this important from a wildlife perspective. In the midst of all of this, you had the tourism

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.600
industry saying, please don't talk about this. Do not say bad things about our area. Their phones,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.160
they said to me, because I was on the tourism board at the time, they said the phones have

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.280
stopped ringing. We have no clients whatsoever there. Why would they want to come here now?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.680
Because all they see is oil on the television and you're helping to promote that.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.800
And I said to them at that time, look, I said this is our only opportunity to highlight

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.760
something as important as an oil spill that has occurred. It's not going away. It's here.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.480
I think the impact for me was as you spend years protecting an environment or environments,

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.240
because you were talking woodlands and meadows, and suddenly something completely out of your control

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.120
occurs, you realize that you failed. And so there was a sense of failure occurring. What could we

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.080
have done better? It was just really sad that you can spend years trying to protect something,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.200
and then something like this occurs. I think because we were an on-the-ground environmental

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.520
group, different from other organizations that came in from the outside that were involved in

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.560
the environment, and they have their voice, and they have their members. We're talking

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.480
millions of members. We're not decrying them. Their voice is as the point is, is that we have

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:31.720
to live here on a day-to-day basis. We need to understand how people survive here in a very

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.960
pristine but very rural area.
