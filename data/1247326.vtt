This is Mark and Samantha, a couple who share some of the difficulties they face in spending time together.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.080
Mark and Samantha's Dad- How do we spend Friday and Saturday nights?

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.240
Mark- Oh, what? That's my favourite day.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.520
Kirsty- Do you get to meet up on a Friday night or Saturday night?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.360
Mark- Well, I can do Friday nights. Friday night, I go to the food shop and my nights.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.200
Saturday.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.720
Mark- Is that a week?

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.000
Kirsty- Saturday, I want to read my web. So, I will read my web on Saturday night, not Friday night.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.480
Samantha- So, you'd like to see...

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.040
Kirsty- I read my web on Saturday night. I love it.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.680
Samantha- And do you meet up on a Saturday night?

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.080
Kirsty- No.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.800
Samantha- And why don't you meet up on a Saturday night?

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.520
Kirsty- I'm allowed to see him, so I'm busy.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.560
Samantha- You're not allowed to see him?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.880
Kirsty- No.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.720
Samantha- Because why?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.120
Kirsty- I don't know.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.520
Samantha- Because the staff say no?

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.840
Kirsty- No.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.200
And why do the staff say no?

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.360
Samantha- Because there's no staff on.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.640
Kirsty- There's no staff on.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.720
Okay. And how does that make you feel?

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.840
Samantha- Unhappy.
