00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
At the moment, are you in a relationship?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm sadly single, meaning that I'm not in a relationship.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I would like to be in one, but I'm finding it hard to find that person.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And when I do eventually find that Mr. Right, is that I'm hoping that we'll be able to settle down.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And if maybe further down the line, start a family, I don't want to be raising that child on my own.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'd rather be with someone, I'd rather be with the partner or the husband that I don't want him to do run a.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So you don't have a boyfriend at the moment?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
No.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But you've been looking for a boyfriend?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I have, if I can say, I've been on some dating sites.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm currently talking to someone who seems to get me, who seems to be another double of me.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And we've been talking online, which is great.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm hoping there would be another, or I'm hoping there will be something there eventually.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But it's hard to tell at the moment.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But saying that I have been talking to other people.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And when I want that certain person, I'm hoping that they're either a year younger than me or a year or maybe two years older than me.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Nothing more.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And have you had any luck finding people online?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
No. They all seem to be very genuine people.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But they seem, after a few days, they seem to disappear.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You don't hear from them again, which I'm finding really difficult and wondering why they're on the dating site in the first place.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And I want to be able to know that I'm speaking to real people and not fake people.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Because I'm at that age now where I just want to be with someone.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I'm finding also my biological clock is ticking and I really, really want to start a family soon.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And finding the right person and not get into trouble when things do happen in the future.
