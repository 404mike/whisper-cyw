00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
Land ownership was rather in the gift of the local lord and people were there by

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.040
individuals, lower orders of society as well, I might crudely put it, didn't own land, so it

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.720
would be the local marcher lord in this case, we're part of the marcher lordship of Mytheannis,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.200
which was sometimes dominated, should be dominated by the Mortimer's, more often than not they were

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:37.680
the marcher family who came at the time of William the Conqueror, but there were local Welsh lords,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.160
those warlords really, the Welsh called themselves princes who dominated the land

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.840
and therefore felt they had the land in their gift and so we had the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.480
the mark when giving land and Roger Mortimer gave land, but they gave the tenants with it as well,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.320
so the tenants really had no choice in that, so they transferred with it and so built up quite a large

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.880
acreage really, looking at the home range of

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.560
of Gotlands I would call it, Golden as some of my colleagues call it,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.080
which basically extended from farms like Esgerwy, from Camden further down the valley,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.880
and Pesigui, towards Herffenduy, northwards, somewhat north of Llandad and Donneth,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.160
and if you go to U-Town you guide onto the main road if you come through the Esgedonpyrn

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.640
bridge and you're still on Abbey land at that point and it extended a bit north of there,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.520
if you go over to Glennoadloys you leave Abbey land when you get to Tullough, so

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:06.400
quite a big range, probably functioned almost as a series of sub-granges,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.000
so all those farms would have been given all that land by one of the marcher lords and for

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.880
example if we were a Welsh lord or the Mortimer in this case, people say we're

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.400
governors of this part of the Welsh marchers.
