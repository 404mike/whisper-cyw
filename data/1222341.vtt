You mentioned Kristallnacht. Yes. So you have some memories of that?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Oh yes. Can you tell me more?

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:21.640
Well, I wasn't out and about when it happened, but all the sort of Jewish

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:33.360
businesses in Cologne were smashed up, windows broken, more or less closed down.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:47.560
My synagogue, well all the synagogues were trashed, burned and smashed up. The

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.240
school I went to, which was sort of attached to one of the synagogues, was

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:09.440
also completely destroyed. So school did not continue after the 9th, 10th of

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:24.360
November, but there were some facilities organized in a big building which

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:36.480
had rooms in it, which was a Jewish community center, I suppose. So that's

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:49.080
where the schooling continued. My headmaster immediately got very busy

00:01:49.080 --> 00:02:00.840
trying to get the whole of the school transferred to Britain. And my class,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.080
which was the sort of third class of high school, in other words, 12, 13 year

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.600
olds, was the first class to come over to England.
