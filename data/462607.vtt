00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Do you remember where you heard about...

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.240
My dad, really, would have read it in the newspaper and heard it on radio,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.360
but my father was fiercely, fiercely concerned about that, you know.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:29.280
I think it was. It was a very sad time for the villages of that area,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.800
when they lost their homes, their church, everything just went under the water, didn't it?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.000
And the reason being to give water to... was it Liverpool or Birmingham?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.320
Liverpool.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.880
Liverpool, yes. Which they don't have this water from that source now, do they?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.200
So in a sense, whereas I suppose the water was their lifeblood then,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.560
it all was to no avail now, from our point of view, many years later, what, 50 odd years later.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.280
But I think the heartbreak it must have caused the people who lived in that village then

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.760
must have been tremendous. And I know my father at the time, who was quite a strong Welsh man,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.600
with very high principles and very strong ideas, I know he was fiercely, fiercely

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:43.600
angered by it. And I think in the family we sensed that, and obviously it made us angry to

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.040
think that the Welsh people were being thrust out of their homes, losing their homes,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.960
to supply water to Liverpool. And if my dad was alive today, I don't think he would have been

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.560
happy to know that water was no longer required. It was a beautiful part of the country, wasn't it?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.200
It still is, it's lovely. And probably you've passed there today. A beautiful, beautiful part.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.120
But then a whole village was wiped out. I don't know that I would have been happy had I been

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.800
old enough, you know, to sort of appreciate, well, could you do anything about it? No,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.560
only by subjection. But it wasn't enough, was it?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.240
Do you remember it being discussed, I mean, beyond your family, I mean, in the community,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.080
here?
