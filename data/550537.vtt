Fel gwharmaeth eich cymorth a'i y dewis,

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.100

I'r hyn rydym yn ei wneud.

Rydyn ni'n gweithio ar y cyd.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.100
Rydyn ni'n cael y llwybr a'n gweithio ar y cyd.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.100
Felly roedd yna targedau?

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.100
O, oes.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.100
Nid, nid yw'n targedau.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.100
Gallwch ddweud hynny.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.100
Gallwch ddweud yna y targedau.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.100
Oherwydd roedd angen i chi wneud yn oed.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.100
Be fyddwch chi'n mynd i'ch gwaith gwaith gwaith.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.100
Felly roedd angen i chi wneud 20

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.100
ac yna'ch gwaith gwaith yn dechrau.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.100
Felly sut ydych chi'n teimlo

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.100
ar un o'r gwaith?

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.100
Ydych chi'n teimlo'r hwnt oherwydd

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.100
roedd gennych chi'r ddopau ffyddiadau parhau

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.100
a byddai'n gweithio'r gwaith.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.100
Ond cael gweithio yn y ffaerwyr yn gweithio ar hyn.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.100
Roedd yn gweithio ar hyn.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.100
Ond rydym wedi'i gwybodaeth.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.100
Rydyn ni'n gwybodaeth, a roeddwn yn cael eu brygiau,

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.100
rydych chi'n gwybod.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.100
Rydyn ni'n gwybod, a oeddwn i ddim yn gwybod y brygiau yn y disgybl.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.100
Ie, roeddwn yn gwybod

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.100
roeddwn yn gwybod,

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.100
Mae'r siarad wedi'i llwyfio a byddwn yn ymwneud y ddau.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.100
Roeddwn i'n cael y brèd yn y mor.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.100
Yna byddwn yn gweithio yn y siarad y ddau.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.100
Yna byddwn yn ceisio efo fy hun.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.100
Cynhyrch y ffrindiau. Roedd yn y gwaith.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.100
Roedd yn unig i ni a'r Llywodraeth yna.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.100
Pan yw'n dod, roedd yn cael ei gweithio nesaf.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.100
Ond i chi, pan ydych chi'n mynd i weithio yn y ffatri,

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.100
a oedd yr adeilad hwn yn rhywbeth y byddwch chi'n ei fwynhau?

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.100
Rwy'n meddwl. Mae rhai o'r bobl yn ffriar, yw i.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.100
Roedd yn ffriar, fel y gallai i'w gyd-flaen.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.100
Roedd yn ffriar, dydw i'n meddwl?

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.100
Nid.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.100
Nid, dydw i ddim yn meddwl.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.100
Roedd yn gallu eu gyd-flaen.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.100
Roedd yn gallu ei gyd-flaen gyda fi.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.100
Roeddwn i'n credu bod yw, roeddwn i wedi'i gwybod â'r bobl hefyd.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.100
Roeddwn i'n credu bod y bobl hwn yn ddiogel â fi.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.100
A roeddwn i wedi'i edrych arno.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.100
Rwy'n credu bod yn... roeddwn i'n bos.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.100
Roeddwn i'n bos o'r bobl, er bod nhw'n ddod oeddiadau.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.100
Rwy'n credu bod yn oeddiad oedd y bobl sydd...

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:35.100
Roedd yn siarad am ddod oeddiadau, oedd y bobl hwn yn ddod oeddiadau, oedd y bobl hwn yn ddod oeddiadau neu beth oedd?

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:40.100
Nid, roeddwn i ddod oeddiadau, ond yn siarad â'u gweithredu,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.100
siarad â'u bod nhw'n fwy fwy oedd i chi.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.100
Rwy'n meddwl, mae fy moth wedi'i ddod i mi,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.100
ond roedd nid yw'n fwy oedd yn fwy oedd y bobl,

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.100
rydym yn y fath o gyfle.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.100
Ond mae hynny'n rhan o ddarparu i ddarparu i y bobl?

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.100
O, oherwydd fy moth wedi'i ddarparu i ddarparu i'r ddod oeddiadau unwaith.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:01.100
A roedd yn amlwg, roedd fy moth wedi'i ddarparu...

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.100
hmm...

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.100
yn mawr, oedd yn gwybod?

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.100
Ie.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.100
Roedd fy fath yn gwneud yn anodd, mae hwn yn y lle rydw i'n dod o.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.100
Roedd fy fath yn rhan o ddarparu.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.580
Yn ychydig ychydig y gallai'r bobl sy'n eich bod yn gobeithio ar y cyfle,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.900
maent yn gallu eu cymryd i chi, ond ydych chi'n gweld amserau o'r bobl

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.900
sy'n gallu cymryd i unrhyw un?

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.900
Yn ychydig, ac rwy'n gwybod eich bod yn cael ei gael.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.900
Os oeswn i'n gweld hynny, byddaf yn ymwneud i'n eu gael.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.900
Beth yw'r hyn sy'n cael ei gweld?

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.900
O fel ymwneud â'u bod yn gallu gwneud rhywbethau.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.900
Felly, byddwn yn y gwaith i'w ddweud, roeddwn i'n byw yn y gofys.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.900
Roeddwn i'n byw yng nghymhau.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.900
Os rhywbeth yn dda, rhai o'r ffrindiau i'n dweud, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r gofys i'w ddweud.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.900
Oherwydd roeddwn i'n ffeindio i'n siarad.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.900
Byddwch chi ddim yn mynd i'r gofys i'r gofys?

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.900
Wel, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r gofys yn y ffordd.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.900
Ond roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n siarad i mi o ran oed, a byddwn i'n mynd i'r gofys.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.900
ground.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.900
roeddwn i'n gweithio'r llyfr, felly roeddwn i'n gweithio'r llyfr.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.900
Yna roeddwn i'n ffon fy marn i ddweud,

Oherwydd roeddwn i'n gweithio'r llyfr, roeddwn i'n ddweud.

Yn unrhyw ffordd.

Ie, oherwydd roeddwn i'n gallu bod yn ffynnu'n llyfr.

Roeddwn i'n cael fy marn i ddweud.

Oherwydd roeddwn i'n gwybod y gwaith yma yna yn ystod y peth.

Roedd yno amser i mi yn cael, roeddwn i'n credu,

Roeddwch chi'n credu ysgol yn ddifysgol? Roeddwch chi'n credu y gwaith yn ddifysgol yn ysgol?

Roedd wedi cael clasiadau ysgol i ddau oedd fy fater ddim yn gallu gwneud yn dda iawn.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.900

Roedd yn dweud, roedd yn gallu gwneud rhywbeth.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.900
Roedd yn cael clasiadau,

Roedd yn cael ei ddarparu fel hynny,

Yn oed, os dwi ddim yn gwneud rhywbeth, roedd angen i fynd ystod a chysylltu.

Roedd hi ddim yn dyslexia, oherwydd?

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.900
Roeddwn i'n credu bod hi oherwydd…

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.900
Roedd nhw ddim yn gwneud hynny yn ystod yna.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.900

Roedden nhw'n cael ei ddweud,

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.900
roedden nhw'n cael ei ddweud,

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.900

roeddwn yn dod yn ôl.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.900
Felly roeddwn i yn ymlaen,

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.900
roeddwn yn ei ddweud.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.900
Roeddwn yn cael eu ddweud i'r dda,

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.900
felly pan ysgol yn ei ddweud,

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.900
roedd yr ystafell yn ei ddweud yn ôl.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.900
Felly dyna un o fy nghymeriau.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.900
Roeddwn yn cael ei gwybodaethu,

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.900
roeddwn yn cael ei gwybodaethu.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.900
Ie, ond roeddwn yn cael nid i'n ei gwybod.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.900
Mae'n fwy fwrdd.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.900
Mae'n rhan o'r rhan,

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.900
ond fel rydw i'n dweud,

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.900
roeddwn yn gallu ei dweud arno ar holl.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.900
Roedd o bobl yn gwybod eich ideau?

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.900
Ie, roeddwn yn gwybod.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.900
Oherwydd os oes gennych rhywun i unrhywun,

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.900
roeddwn yn ei wneud yn ôl a'i ddweud o'r hyn.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.900
Roedd hynny'n digwydd?

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.900
Nid i'n gallu i unrhyw un o'r bobl

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.900
oherwydd roeddwn yn cael ei ddweud beth i'w wneud.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.900
Roeddwn yn cael ei ddweud ymlaen,

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.900

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.900
a roeddwn yn cael ei ddweud i unrhyw un.

Roeddwn yn cael ei ddweud.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.900
Ond mae'n rhan o'r hyn

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.900
oherwydd roeddwn yn gallu

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.900
i'w dweud yn y papur.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.900
Oherwydd oherwydd o'r ddweud,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.900
mae'n dda iawn, roeddwn yn cael ei ddweud o'r bobl.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.900
Roeddwn yn cael ei ddweud i unrhyw un.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.900
Oherwydd dyna beth roeddwn yn cael ei ddweud.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.900
Roedd ymlaen yn cael ei ddweud,

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.900
ac roedd o'r ideau'n eu gynhyrchu.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.900
Felly roedd yn dda iawn.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.900
Roeddwn yn eithaf yn dda i'w gynhyrchu eich ideau?

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.900
Oherwydd rydych chi'n gwybod,

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.900
rydych chi'n mannau a'r staff,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.900
a'r hyn yn cael ei ddweud?

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.900
Roeddwn yn dda, yn y cyfnod,

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.900
ond fel rydw i'n dweud,

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.900
rydw i'n bwysig,

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.900
a rydw i'n.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.900
Felly os ydym wedi'i ddweud i mi,

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.900
roeddwn yn cael ei ddweud.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.900
Rwy'n gwybod, roeddwn yn eithaf

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.900
yn dda i'w ddweud.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.900
Ond roeddwn yn cael ei ddweud,

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.900
roeddwn yn dda i'w ddweud?

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.900
Roeddwn yn dda i'w ddweud,

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.900
ond roeddwn yn cael ei ddweud o'r charn.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.900
A dyna'r llyfr.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.900
Felly pan oeddwch chi'n mynd i weithio yno,

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.900
oedd o'r unrhyw un o'ch ffamiliau yn weithio yno?

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.900
Ie, fy nghymdeithas yn weithio yno,

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.900
fy oedau.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.900
Maen nhw wedi'i ddweud,

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.900
roedd hi wedi'i dweud yno.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.900
Felly a oedd hi'n mynd i weithio yno?

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.900
Dwi'n meddwl ei fod yn mynd i'r optigol.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.900
O, rwy'n gwybod.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.900
Dwi'n meddwl yna sut roedd hi'n mynd.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.900
A oedd hi'n mynd i'r ystafell?

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.900
A oedd hi'n mynd i'r ystafell?

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.900
Rwy'n credu bod roedd hi'n rhan o chwe lawr am15 o da shout ...

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.900

Roeddwn i'n gweithio'n ddwy-dwy o ffyrdd oed.

Roedd nhw'n gweithio'r pethau ddwy-dwy oed yna?

Ie, roedd nhw'n gweithio'r pethau ddwy-dwy oed yna.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.900
Felly yna, roeddwn i'n gwneud yn ffwrdd.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.900
Yna roedd nhw'n gwneud ymlaen o'r ddwy-dwy oed yn ôl.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.900
Oherwydd roeddwn ni'n ymlaen oedd.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.900
Ond roedd nhw'n cael ei gweithio arno oherwydd nad oedd hi'n...

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.900

Roedd hi'n cael ei gweithio arno, ond roedd nhw'n...

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.900
roedd nhw'n dda i'n ddwy-dwy oed.

Roedd hi'n cael ei gweithio arno, roedd hi'n dda i gael ei gweithio 40 oed oed yn dda.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.900
Mae'n bwysig iawn.

Oherwydd os ydych chi'n cael rôl, mae'n cael ei gweithio...

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.900
Mae'n cael ei gweithio ar pob un.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.900
Ie, iawn.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.900
Roedd hi'n cael ei gweithio.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.900
Yn oed yn siarad am gweithio yn y gwaith,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.900
a yna yn y siop, a yna yn y ffactor.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.900
Beth oedd pobl oedd yn dechrau?

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.900
Beth oedd ymddygiadau at y bobl yn gweithio yn Morris Motors?

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.900
Yn oed?

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.900
O, roeddwn ni...

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.900
roeddwn ni'n dda iawn o bobl.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.900
Oherwydd roeddwn ni'n dechrau yn y ffactor.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.900
Wel, os ydych chi ddechrau, roeddwn yn rhan o'r ffactor.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.900
A dyna'n peth diwethaf.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.900
Os ydych chi'n y ffactor a ddych chi ddweud,

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.900
unrhyw un oed yn dda, roeddwn yn dweud,

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.900
F of, yw'n gwybod?

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.900
Roedd yn peth cyfrannol, oherwydd pan dwi'n mynd ymlaen,

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.900
yn St.Colins,

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.900
roeddwn yn dweud rhywbeth yn y ffactor,

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.900
a roeddwn yn dweud, roeddwn yn dweud,

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.900
roeddwn yn dweud, roeddwn yn dweud,

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.900
roeddwn yn dweud,

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.900
Yr ymlaen rydym chi'n dda iawn oherwydd ydym ni ddim ni'n oed yn dda.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.900
Ond gan ddod yn y ffactor, dydw i'n oed yn gwybod.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.900
A dyw chi'n gwybod sut i'n dda?

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:23.900
Roeddwn yn dweud,

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.900
roeddwn yn dda,

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.900
roeddwn yn dda, roeddwn yn dda,

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.900
roeddwn yn dda,

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.900
roeddwn yn dda,

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.900
roeddwn yn dda,

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.900
roeddwn yn dda,

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.900
roeddwn yn dda,

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.900
Roeddwn yn gallu cael ei wneud yng nghymru, os yw fy sysynedd wedi dod yn ystod hynny, oedd yn oed yn oliell.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:51.900
Ond oes gennych chi bod rhai o bobl wedi'i ddod o'r holl ffordd yma o'r holl ffordd sy'n gweithio yn Moris Motors?

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.900
Oherwydd, ydych chi'n gwybod, ydych chi'n gwybod, ydych chi'n gwybod.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.900
Yn oed, o'r holl ffordd ydych chi'n gwybod.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.900
Oes gennych chi bod pobl eraill wedi'i ddod?

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.900
Roeddwn yn gallu bod yn gwybod.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.900
Ond roeddwn yn dweud hynny.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.900
Roeddwn yn gwybod llawer o bobl ymlaen y ffactor, oherwydd mae'n gweithio i'r holl ffactor.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.900
Roedd yn gweithio i'n gweithio i'r holl ffrindiau yma ar y tîm hwn.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.900
Felly pan ddych chi'n gweithio â nhw, ddych chi'n gweithio â nhw?

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.900
I'n gweithio â'u gweithwyr.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:16.900
Mae'n gweithio.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.900
Roeddwn yn gwybod, roeddwn yn gweithio a ddod o'r 2,000 gwell yn ystod hynny.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.900
Roedd oedd llawer o bobl o bryd.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.900
Mae llawer o bobl o bryd.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.900
A dyna beth yw hynny?

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:36.900
Rwy'n credu bod yna oherwydd y byddai'r bobl yn gweithio mwy o'r bobl.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:42.900
Nid oedd unrhyw beth, ond roedd yn dweud y byddai'n ffeillio â'r bobl i wneud eu hefyd i'r ffactor.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:49.900
Ond roedd oedd unrhyw beth, ond rwy'n credu bod yn ffeillio â'r bobl o'r holl ffactor.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.900
Roedd yn gweithio â phobl yn ystod hynny.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.900
Ond roedd yn gweithio â nil am y byddai'r bobl yn cael eu gweithio.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.900
Rwy'n credu bod yn dda.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.900
Rwy'n credu bod yn dda.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.900
Oherwydd roedd pobl yn fwy fwyaf o bobl, nid oeddai?

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.900
Roedd pobl ddim yn cymryd rhywbeth o bryd rydym yn gweithio.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.900
Roedd y gweithio'n bwysig, ond roedd yn bwysig.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:11.900
Roedd roedd yn bwysig.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.900
Roedd gen i ddweud y byddai'n dweud roedd yn bwysig.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.900
Roedd yn bwysig, yn ystod hynny, pan roeddwn yn mynd yn y sefydliad.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.900
Roeddwn yn gweithio 40 o bom sefydliad.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.900
Rwy'n gweithio arall fel bod hi'n gwneud rhywbeth.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.900
Rwy'n gweithio yn ystod hynny heddiw, yn enwedig.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.900
Sut y byddwch yn gweithio?

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.900
Sut y byddwch yn gweithio?

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.900
Felly, rwy'n cael ei ddechrau.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.900
O'n iawn.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.900
Roeddwn i ddim wedi cael ddod o ffyrdd.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.900
Nid oeddwn i'n croeso ar ymweliad, roeddwn i wedi cael rhan o bans,

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.900
ond heddiw gallwch chi gyd yn teimlo.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.900
Rwy'n gweithio, oeddwn i ddim.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.500
Roeddwn i'n credu, oeddwn i'n gweithio ar hyn o bryd gweithio, oherwydd roeddwn i'n gobeithio i'w gweithio,

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.260
a'r hyn yn gweithio ar eich llwybr, neu ar eich am.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.460
Dyma pan oedd yn y sefydliad?

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.460
Yn y sefydliad, yn y bryd.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.460
Mae llawer o'r pethau yn y sefydliad.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.100
A gallwch chi ddechrau hynny i mi ar y sefydliad?

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.420
Pan oedd yn y sefydliad, rydyn ni'n gwneud y sefydliad yn ogystal â'r amser.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.340
Felly gallwch chi gydweud sut oeddwn i'n gweithio ar y fframe,

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.140
neu, yn ogystal â pe bryd gweithio, rydych chi'n gweithio ar y fframe.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.700
Ac oherwydd y pethau, gallwch chi gydweud sut oeddwn yn ogystal â'r amser.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.180
Rydwch chi'n gweithio ar y sefydliad,

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.420
a'i gweithio ar y fframe,

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.900
a'i gweithio ar y pethau, ar bob rhan.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.660
Cymaint o'n gwybod bod yn cael 15, 20 gweithi ar y sefydliad.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.260
Ond os oedd yn y gweithi'r amser, gallwch chi gydweud sut oeddwn i'n gweithio ar y sefydliad.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.260
Ond oedd yn gweithio ar y sefydliad,

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.260
a'i gweithio ar unrhyw person,

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.260
ac yna'n gweithio ar y sefydliad,

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.260
ac yna'n gweithio ar y gweithiau.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.260
A'ch chi'n gweithio ar y sefydliad fel hyn,

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.260
a'ch chi'n gweithio ar 40, 50,

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.260
yn yr amser.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.260
Mae'n gwych.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.260
Felly oedd y men yn gweithio ar y sefydliad?

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.260
Yn ogystal â pho.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.260
Ie, roedd nhw'n cael men yn gweithio ar y sefydliad.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.260
Er bod wedi hynô yn y ma.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.260
Ond roedd yn gwych o'r man.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.260
Man fel hyn.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.260
Roedd gennych nhw'n gweithio mewn workers?

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.260
S partial, dechort i weldedd,

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.260
roedd gennych nhw'n gweithio.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.020
Beth меняwt ymlaen,

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.020
roedden nhw i mi dintag i fynd,

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.020
oherwydd roedd hi'n cael eich safbwylediaeth.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.020
Felly roeddwn i mewn at byجadau talad-lewi possible.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.540
Coming o weithio hyn,

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.620
roedd wedi hyffig yn Irish.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.260
O Geschichte Ang endors,

O, dyma, dweud hi'n dweud.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.260
A dwi'n mynd i'r ffactor.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.260
A dyma'r ddweud y dweud.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.260
Dwi'n mynd i fynd i bobl oherwydd roedd yn dweud,

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.260
roeddwn i'n cael gyrfa gyda'n nhw.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.260
Roedd o'n unig o'r dyd.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.260
A dwi'n mynd i'r siop rŵan,

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.260
dwi'n dweud y ffwrdd, a dwi'n mynd i'r ddweud gyda Mr Reed.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.260
Mr Reed o'n oed i fynd i,

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.260
a oedd o'n 7 o'r oed,

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.260
oedd o'r oed yn ystod.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.260
Ond roedd y ffwrdd 8 o'r oed,

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.260
pan oedd yn ystod, oedd yn ystod.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.260
Roedd yn dda iawn yn dda iawn.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.260
Ie, ond roeddwn i'n dda iawn yna.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:08.260
Yn oed, roeddwn i'n cael y ffwrdd yma gyda fi.

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.260
Roeddwn i'n dda iawn yna, Yvonne.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.260
Roeddwn i'n dda iawn, nid dwi'n dda i'n dda iawn.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.260
Do you think that helped then working the farm?

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.260
I did think it helped.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.260
So you started at 8 o'clock, or half past 7?

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.260
What was the official time?

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.260
Well, 7 o'clock we started at 1.7, then it went to half past 7.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.260
Gosh, that's early, isn't it?

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.260
It was early.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.260
And when you're talking about the bus, is that a works bus?

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.260
Works bus. Service bus.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.260
But the works used to, you know, not sanction them, what do you call it?

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.260
Subsidise them?

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.260
Yes, yes.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.260
So did you have fun on the bus?

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.260
Oh yes, we did.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.260
I don't forget one day, getting onto the bus,

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.260
and this fella, he's dead, no, but he died in an accident.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.260
Scub-a-neck, do you know him?

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:56.260
Well, he said to me, you're coming home with me, drag me on the bus.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.260
I thought it was our bus.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.260
Trim Sarfan, I landed up.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.260
Because the buses used to go everywhere, see, there'd be a line of them.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.260
Did he know that?

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.260
Yes. He was wicked, you know, and he was handsome, but I wouldn't have gone anywhere with him.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.260
No, boyfriend didn't know that.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.260
Yeah, no, he didn't know that, no.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.260
I think I'd finish with him at that, say.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.260
No, but he was a good friend.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.260
We used to have some good bunts.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.260
Was there much gossip going on there?

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.260
Because you were a community, weren't you?

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.260
Oh yes, everybody knew everybody else's business.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.260
Did you mind that, because some people don't like that, do they?

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:32.260
I didn't mind it, because I mean, I had nothing to hide.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.260
You know, if somebody's got anything to hide, don't say nothing.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:40.260
But I not went to, like I say, I wear everything on my sleeve.

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.260
There weren't many secrets in there?

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.260
No, no, not many.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:48.260
Because what used to go on there was quite harrowing.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:52.260
Used to see some things, oof.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.260
What, somebody going off with somebody else?

00:31:54.260 --> 00:32:00.260
Yes, yes, carrying on, people getting pregnant and putting them down the toilet.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.260
Oh, never.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.260
Oh yes, it was a bit, erm.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.260
Oh gosh, that is harrowing, isn't it?

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.260
Oh yes, used to see it all going on.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.260
Oh gosh.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.260
Oh yes, it was their business, like I say, it wasn't in their mind.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:16.260
They wanted to do it. Carry on.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.260
Where were most of the girls from then? Which areas do you reckon?

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:24.260
Oh, they were at Burryport, there was a lot from Burryport.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:28.260
Trimsaren, Pontaberran, Pontiets.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:34.260
We had some from Gosain then.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:38.260
Oh, they were from various areas, Amernford.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:42.260
You know, they were quite vast areas.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.260
Was it noisy there?

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:48.260
Oh, it was very noisy. Very noisy, you had to shout.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.260
That's why I think there aren't any shouts today.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:54.260
Because it was, if you didn't shout nobody would hear you anyway.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.260
But could you talk, or were you too busy anyway?

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.260
Well no you talk, but you had to shout to talk.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.260
You know, that's why most people have got claims in today.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.260
But are they successful though, because it's difficult to prove, isn't it?

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:12.260
Well, I had a job to prove mine, I had it.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.260
I'm talking now, ten years ago I put in my claim, and they're all doing it now.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:20.260
But I had to put it in ten years ago because I thought I had some damage in it.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.260
Grom it, something wrong with the...

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.260
Well, it wasn't just through noise inhalation.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:32.260
But I'd been with the union for a while, and they told me then that it was operable.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.260
So I thought, well I couldn't have an op in it, innocent enough.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.260
So when I went to the general they told me no.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.260
You've got a damaged nerve due to noise inhalation, there's nothing we can do about it.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.260
So how does that affect you today?

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.260
Well I get terrible synotest.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.260
And I can't talk to anybody.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.260
I can't talk to anybody without seeing their face.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.260
I've got to look at somebody.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.260
If you talk to me now and I'm turning away, I can't really hear you.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.260
I can hear you, but I wouldn't be able to make out exactly what you're saying.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.260
So are you lip reading?

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.260
I lip read, I lip read a lot.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.260
Especially when we go out in a gang.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:14.260
You know if we go out and we're on a big table, and they're in them like this if they're talking.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.260
I can't hear you.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.260
It's embarrassing as well.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.260
Like I'm saying I had my clean ten years ago.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.260
Perhaps I'd have more today if I had it today.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.260
Oh it's done now.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.260
It's done now, yes.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.260
There's nothing I can do about it.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.260
I spent the money on that.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.260
Did girls lip read while they were working?

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.260
Yes, yes.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.260
Because I've heard somebody else say that.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.260
Yes, you had to watch them.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.260
You know because otherwise you wouldn't be able to understand what they were saying.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:45.260
Because you imagine the banging was going on there.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.260
Because you'd have somebody plugging by the side of you.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.260
Opening things for you to weld.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.260
Silencers ready for you to weld and things.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.260
So you didn't have anything over your years?

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.260
No we never had nothing then.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.260
There was no, never even existed I don't think then.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.260
What were you wearing then?

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.260
Did you have a uniform?

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.260
Green overall down to here.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.260
Lovely.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.260
We swam then you know.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.260
We had aprons on.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.260
To stop the weld from burning you.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.260
Conclets.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.260
Or when we went gas welding we had a visor on our faces.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.260
You know one of these goggles we had on.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.260
Like a thing up here.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.260
And so we have on spats on your feet.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.260
Oh they did give you that equipment mine.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.260
But you had to buy your gloves.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.260
Oh did you?

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.260
That's cheeky isn't it?

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.260
Yeah.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.260
But they were giving you the money back when they said you had to buy them.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.260
But you were getting it back and you'd pay.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.260
Say you were paying a penny for them.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.260
You'd get it back and you'd pay then.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.260
Because I think they thought people were wasting them.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.260
So I think it was a way of controlling it then.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.260
Which was good as it was.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.260
Do you think the work was dangerous at all then?

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.260
Yes.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.260
You didn't think it at the time but it was.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.260
Because one of the girls burnt her head off.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.260
Because we had a few explosions there with the gas.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.260
Because it was bottled at the time but then they put it on mains.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.260
So that it was flowing to everybody.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.260
Well what happened as it was it was a new thing and it blew back.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:28.260
Somebody went to light a lamp and they must have had an air pocket in there.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.260
Blew back to this other girl.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.260
Because I had a, and I was carrying my boy at the time.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.260
Well they had to jump over the conveyors to get me.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.260
Because I was in the middle of the air and nobody heard it.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.260
So they jumped over the conveyors to get me.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.260
By the time they got, this one's air had all gone.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.260
I shouldn't laugh at them.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.260
But she loved her bloody hair.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.260
I think she had a load of lacquer on it.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.260
Oh probably, yeah.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.260
It was a flamma blood.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.260
She must have gone to weld at the time.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:02.260
So they said, had her, lovely.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.260
Did she get any compo do you think?

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.260
I don't know, she must have.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.260
I didn't claim anything, ma'am.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.260
I suppose you didn't think to claim these days, did you?

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.260
No, I did claim for my arm though.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.260
Yes, I cut my arm in the conveyor.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.260
So I had to claim for that £100.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.260
But that was a lot of money in them days.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.260
So what happened to your arm?

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.260
I got it caught in the conveyor.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.260
And we complained about this conveyor for a long time.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.260
We used to put the silencers on after you welded them.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.260
And we used to have a thing on for the spares.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.260
If the conveyor wouldn't hit them, if you were doing too many.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.260
We had a conveyor, like a stand on the conveyor.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.260
We'd asked them to weld them on.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.260
Oh no, we can't do that, we can't do that.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:54.260
But what had happened, where the silencers are on this thing, this stand,

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.260
my arm had gone under.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.260
I had to put a silencer on because I was chucking them on the conveyor.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.260
And the other one silenced the conveyor and jammed underneath.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.260
Brought it over and came down on my arm.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.260
So my arm was being dragged down now.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.260
With this thing on the conveyor, nobody could stop it.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.260
So by the time they came, I passed out anyway.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.260
Did it break?

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:21.260
No. They couldn't get over how it had broken.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.260
I was black and blue, mine.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.260
But they couldn't understand how it didn't break.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.260
Strong. Tough old bird.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:33.260
Did they take safety seriously then?

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.260
No, not really then.

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.260
Because when they went to carry me out, it was so comical.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:43.260
They had, luckily I didn't see it, they had a stretcher.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:49.260
They went to get the stretcher off the wall, put me on it, went to pick it up.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.260
The stretcher pad was still on the floor.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.260
Here in the Abbey and Groose. It had rotted.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.260
They had safety conscious, they weren't even checking the equipment.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.260
So the two boys that picked me up, I think both of them are dead and I love them,

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.260
and one was on the union.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.260
And they were arguing which side they were going to pick up.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:12.260
Who was going to have my legs and who was going to have my tits?

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.260
And there was a big argument between them.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:20.260
So I think by the time I got come round, they were still arguing.

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.260
They were so offended.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.260
Which union was it in the factory?

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.260
Transport and General?

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.260
Transport and General.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.260
When I first started, they were used to pay it down in the toilets.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.260
Because they didn't recognise the union.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.260
Never?

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.260
No, it can even then.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.260
So what year would that be now?

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.260
1967.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.260
Oh, they didn't recognise the union?

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.260
They didn't recognise it just after that.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.260
That's quite late, isn't it?

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.260
But it had to be a clothes shop then.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.260
Everybody had to be in it.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.260
So I think what it was, there was a bit of conflict at that time.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.260
So they didn't know then.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.260
I think it was 1967 or 1968.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.260
So what was the shops doing taking the money in the toilets?

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.260
Taking the money in the toilets.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.260
I'm not sure whether it was a five pence or something.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.260
I could have fetched a union card, I'm sure I've got one now.

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.260
Or a penny.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.260
Could have been a penny.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.260
But what did the managers say then?

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.260
They must have known that.

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.260
Yes, they knew what to do.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.260
But they're not going to say anything.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.260
You know, they wouldn't say anything.

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.260
Well, it wasn't that much management then.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.260
Oh, it wasn't there?

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.260
No, you only had one big manager.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.260
Then you had four men.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:38.260
You had one superintendent that was over the factory, not like today.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.260
You know, so you didn't have that many managers there.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.260
And then were there charge hands or something as well?

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.260
Yes, four men.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:50.260
Were they men and women?

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.260
Yes, yes, they were men and women.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.260
We had two women over us.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.260
Oh, three, sorry, there was Rachel, Mair.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:01.260
Rachel Mair.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.260
Oh, I can't remember the other one's name.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:08.260
So there were chances for girls to go on to be...

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.260
Oh yes, four women because I was asked to become one.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.260
I was asked to become one.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.260
Like I say, if I'd have...

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:20.260
The paperwork had just with me, if I could have done the paperwork.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.260
I'd have been a boss then by now.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.260
Sure you would.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:27.260
Yes, because I'd have liked to have done something.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.260
It was just that...

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.260
Did you find the work run out in us then?

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:37.260
No, not really because I had fun doing it, you know.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.260
I used to take pride in my work.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.260
And the quicker I could go and do it perfectly, the better I felt.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.260
And you could earn more money.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:48.260
And I could earn more money until they stopped the piecework.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.260
Were there some girls who couldn't do the work?

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:58.260
Because you obviously got really high practical skills on the show.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.260
But some people are hopeless, I'd be hopeless.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:04.260
Yes, so we did have some men and I trained like them.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.260
I was terrible.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.260
I shouldn't have I suppose.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.260
But if I'd seen somebody slacking, I'd go and help them.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.260
If I could see them, I couldn't do work.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.260
Because I trained a lot of people there.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.260
I trained my mother-in-law for one.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.260
Because she used to gas weld.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.260
My mother-in-law worked there before me.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.260
Well, I trained her because the gas welding was finished in.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.260
So I trained her to see how to weld.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.260
I trained Valisante, I trained loads of people there.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.260
Did you get extra money then for that?

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.260
Well, yes.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.260
When I put in for it, I used to forget to put in for it.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.260
Because I was having so much fun doing it.

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.260
I used to work as well and train them.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.260
Or they were getting their money's worth out of me.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.260
They had their money's worth out of me.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:51.260
If I never had another thing, they've had goods 40 years out of me then.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.260
Do you know we were talking about management earlier?

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:59.260
And you were saying there were very few managers there at the beginning.

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.260
Is that something that grew then?

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.260
Yes, it did.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.260
Why is that then?

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.260
I don't know.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.260
We had one big manager.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.260
Then I think there was one for each of the sections.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.260
But then you had a manager.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:19.260
You had his understudy, which was a...

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.260
What they call them, I forget what they call them now.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.260
Like an undermanager or something.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.260
Yes, yeah, undermanagers.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:34.260
But when I finished up there, you had team leaders and line leaders and line feeders.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.260
Do you think that was unnecessary?

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.260
I think it's really stupid.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.260
The idea of that was Japanese.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:51.260
They wanted them to do work, take over when somebody was going off the line and things like that.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:55.260
And that's what they should have been doing.

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.260
But they weren't. They took it too serious.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:04.260
They were doing all the sitting back and letting you do everything.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.260
But if you'd gone and tell them, look, I've got to go, well, go then.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.260
No, we'll carry on.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.260
So I think it was unnecessary.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:19.260
Because they get paid a lot as well for not contributing that much.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.260
Don't treat them like we are.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.260
Don't they? It's a big wage to pay.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.260
It was, it's stupid.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.260
And I think they're still doing it today.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:31.260
Because if it works in Japan, it doesn't work here.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:35.260
Different culture, different people, isn't it?

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:39.260
So were there skilled jobs there and unskilled jobs?

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:44.260
Were there different degrees of skill needed for different jobs there?

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.260
Well, you could have done your training.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:52.260
I could have gone on to do special skills in Wellington.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.260
But I didn't want to. I was quite happy doing what I was doing.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.260
Why is that then?

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:02.260
But at the end of the day, we were all doing the same job anyway.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.260
And they didn't, I don't think they recognised it there.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:11.260
But you could have gone somewhere else to do if you'd not made well done, what was the other one?

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.260
Co-did well done.

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:17.260
You know, some of the boys could have gone on to do that.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:21.260
And saying that, some of the boys came there with co-did well done and doing ordinary jobs.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.260
So I don't think it made any difference.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.260
But you could still make good money.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.260
Yes.

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.260
There were apprentices there, were there?

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:36.260
Yes, apprentices there for tool setting, electricians, fitters.

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.260
Yes, there were quite a few apprentices.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.260
And they were always boys, were they? Young boys?

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:44.260
No, we had some girls. We had girls electricians.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.260
Oh, did you? Oh, I didn't know that.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.260
Yes, we had a few.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:53.260
But that's not something that would have appealed to you if you had been different?

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:57.260
No, no. I was quite happy doing what I was doing.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:01.260
Because I went on to do different jobs then after the welding finished.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.260
I went on to soldering.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.260
In a way, I enjoyed soldering.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:10.260
Which job did you enjoy the best then? Out of all the jobs you did there?

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.260
Out of all the jobs.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:16.260
Well, let's see, I enjoyed welding because I was good at it.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:19.260
I enjoyed it when I done it.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.260
So how did the men and the women get on then, do you think?

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.260
Oh, pretty good.

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:31.260
Because I think half of them married one another anyway.

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.260
They were quite...

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.260
But a lot of them had met there?

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.260
Their partners there.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:44.260
So when I saw you in Pont d'Aberin before, you were talking about an initiation ceremony you had.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.260
Yes, yes.

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.260
Can you tell me about that?

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.260
I was married then, men.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.260
So my husband knew what I was doing.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.260
He knows what I'm like.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:59.260
So if the boys would come in, no new boys, they'd say, you've got to go and see Yvonne by then now.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:02.260
What for? You've got an initiation, please.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:05.260
So the boys would come up to me and I'd say, bend over.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.260
What for? What for?

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.260
Bend over and I'd just go, dooooo.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.260
I'd give them a little tickle.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.260
You're alright, boy. You can go.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.260
They'd be going out of there with red faces.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.260
I'd be dead today.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.260
You know, but I'd play play. I never touched them, I.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.260
It was only a little tease.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.260
It was never, I'd never put my hands on their little woolies.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.260
What people thought I was doing, men.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:32.260
Because I had one chap, he was a big rugby player.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:37.260
And he was scared stiff of me running round the factory rather than standing by me.

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.260
You didn't chase after him, did you?

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.260
No, no. I did sometimes.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:45.260
But we had some fun. It was good fun, weren't it?

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.260
Well, there are lots of different things like that.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.260
You know, were there initiation ceremonies for any of the girls?

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.260
Or if somebody was getting married, was there anything like that?

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.260
Oh yes, oh yes. You'd have hammering if you were getting married.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.260
They'd put you in a pallet.

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:02.260
Put all stuff over you. They'd cover you with flour, eggs.

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.260
Curry powder, jam.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.260
Put condoms on you. Oh yes.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.260
Was this for the girls or for the boys now?

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.260
For both. It was for both.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:15.260
And sometimes they'd put a ball and chain on the men.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.260
Oh, jeez.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.260
Yeah, balls and chains on the men, wouldn't they?

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.260
Always, you don't have some fun then.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:27.260
Can you remember how much you were paid when you started there?

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.260
I'm sure it was £3.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:34.260
From the £3 mark when you first started.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.260
But like I'm saying, you were having piecework.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.260
Once you were done your six weeks.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:42.260
You had six weeks training as they called it.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.260
But then once you'd done that, you had your piecework.

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:49.260
But like I'm saying, you had to do so much before you could claim your piecework.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:53.260
And can you remember if you had pay rises regularly then?

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.260
Well, we were putting in for them every year.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.260
If we didn't, we'd go out on strike.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.260
Yeah, we were.

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:03.260
Were there strikes? Yes.

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:06.260
What were they about usually?

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.260
If it was too hot there, because you wouldn't work in the heat.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:13.260
And they wouldn't give you nothing because they used to give you salt tablets at one time.

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:17.260
And if they didn't give you anything, we'd walk out.

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.260
So everything would be on stop then?

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.260
Everything would be on stop if it was too cold.

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:24.260
So who would call you out? The shop steward?

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:28.260
No, just more or less either the boys or whatever.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.260
But you'd go and see the shop steward.

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.260
You'd tell him your point of view and he'd say,

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:37.260
Well, we'll have to go. We'll have to see about it.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.260
So we'd all walk out, get the management down to see you,

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.260
talk about it if they didn't like it,

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.260
well, we'll see you tomorrow.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.260
And that's who it was.

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.260
Do you think you had the power then?

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.260
We did. We had the power.

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.260
It was the workers had the say in them days, not like today.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:57.260
And I think a lot of it the youngsters have let go.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:01.260
Because the youngsters were too afraid to lose their jobs.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.260
Which is fair enough. There's no jobs to go to today, is there?

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:06.260
No.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:12.260
But I feel sorry for them because they're letting the work rule them.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.260
But we didn't. We ruled the work.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.260
And we worked hard for it.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:20.260
So they were gaining as well as us.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.260
So it was pretty good.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.260
So how would you, when you first started there, you were very young.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.260
How did you spend your money? Did you give some at home?

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.260
Oh, yes, I had to give some money at home.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:37.260
You didn't give your pay package to your mother though?

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.260
Because some girls, I know, give the whole pay package in your pocket.

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.260
No, no. I never did that and I never will.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:45.260
I wouldn't do it to my own man and I wouldn't do it to anybody.

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.260
No, you'd tell him what you had and I'd give her so much a week.

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.260
Well, I had to keep so much back for bus fare.

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:55.260
And if I spent my bus fare like I told you, I had to walk very often.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:59.260
So that was my look out. I'd never ask my mother for a penny.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.260
I wouldn't ask her for any money back.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.260
Because she'd tell me where to go, I think.

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:09.260
But if I didn't have my own bus fare, it was my fault and I'd have to be penalised.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.260
I'd get to work with my men.

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.260
It was the penalit.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:16.260
But your social life at the time was around the factory more or less?

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:17.260
Yes.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:24.260
So what type of thing, what type of events did they have on?

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.260
Well, we'd go on trips.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.260
They'd organise trips. They were one of the girls.

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:34.260
We'd organise a trip and we'd go out to Gosainan or anywhere like that.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.260
So the girls themselves would organise a trip?

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.260
Organise a trip. Oh yes, they wouldn't do it for you.

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.260
Oh, they wouldn't?

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.260
Oh, God, no.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:44.260
They must have organised a Christmas party or something for you, did they?

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.260
No, no. We used to do it yourself.

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.260
All right.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:51.260
We used to take bulls into work. We'd aid it all year.

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.260
And then we'd have a party then on the last day.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.260
We'd get the four men. We'd try and stop it, mind.

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:59.260
But by the end of it, they joined in.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:02.260
We were having a party at nine o'clock in the morning.

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.260
Oh, we'd have some fun. We did.

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.260
Pardon me, we worked hard and played hard.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:11.260
Were there any perks for working in the factory?

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.260
Yes, you'd get your silencers cheaper.

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.260
You know, you could have things cheaper.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:18.260
You could get your cars cheaper.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.260
The trouble is we couldn't afford it.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.260
No.

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:28.260
I say, you know, when I knew a tall was £300 and something,

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:33.260
you know, that would be a lot for us to spend then.

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.260
So we couldn't afford it.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.260
But I mean, it would be cheaper than buying it in the garage.

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:44.260
I can't say about 25% cheaper, something like that.

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.260
But still, you couldn't afford it.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.260
If I couldn't afford bus fare, I'm damn sure I couldn't afford a car.

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.260
But why couldn't you afford bus fare then?

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.260
Were you spending all your money?

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.260
I spent my money on something else.

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.260
Like what?

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.260
Stockings.

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:00.260
I thought you were it buying stockings.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.260
Because you couldn't afford them.

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.260
You used to have your mother's after that.

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:07.260
You know, so we had the things like that, you know.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:10.260
Cigarettes then when I smoked it.

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.260
Did a lot of the girls smoke?

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.260
Yes, most of them.

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.260
Most of the girls smoked in them days.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:20.260
But what if you were gasping for a cigarette then?

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:23.260
You couldn't just leave while you were working?

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:25.260
Oh, you smoke on the job.

00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.260
Oh, right.

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:28.260
Yes, you could smoke on the job then.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.260
You'd have a cigarette for that.

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:32.260
You're lucky you didn't go up with that girl's hair then.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.260
Oh, no, we used to smoke on the factory then.

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:36.260
There was nothing.

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:37.260
And they didn't mind that?

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.260
No.

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.260
Well, I suppose it was benefiting them.

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.260
Well, it's never been an issue.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.260
Because the foreman would walk around with a fag in his mouth.

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:49.260
It's never been an issue in work until they're smoking him in.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:54.260
Do you think that the bosses were fair?

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.260
Do you think they were good employers?

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.260
Some of them were.

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:02.260
I don't think.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.260
I liked Reed.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.260
Like I say, I liked one of the bosses.

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.260
He was lovely.

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:11.260
But I was cheeky to them as well, ma'am.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:14.260
I wouldn't let them get away with anything.

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.260
But I think you're better off if you're cheeky.

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.260
I'm better off if you're cheeky, aren't you?

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.260
If you're a bit nervous of them, yes.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.260
Nervous of them, yes.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.260
Nervous of them, yes.

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.260
No, no, I got on good with them.

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.260
So you were talking about disputes earlier and problems and stuff.

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.260
It was normally about the temperature, or was it about other things as well?

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:36.260
Oh, no, about the work, about the work conditions.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:42.260
And you'd find out then that another company doing the same job as you were getting W.O. wages.

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.260
And you'd find this out because it's something would come in a pallet.

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:49.260
You'd read it, oh, look at this, same thing, same job.

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.260
And then it was, you know.

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.260
What type of thing would come in a pallet from the same company?

00:54:54.260 --> 00:55:01.260
Same company from, because we were working for companies that were in Longbridge.

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.260
And was the other one, Oxford.

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:09.260
And we'd get pallets for them and it would show somebody had put his payslip in there.

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:12.260
You know, we'd find out how much they were earning.

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.260
And the same company.

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:16.260
So that's why we used to go up to the strike then.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:20.260
Then they used to try and tell us the cost of living was more up there.

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:24.260
But it wasn't terrible to what we were paying.

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.260
So then we'd go up to the strike, we'd make a bit more money.

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:31.260
We'd get more holidays because at the time we weren't having much holidays.

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.260
So that's what we used to fight for.

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:38.260
For holidays, which they're letting go again today.

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:41.260
How much holidays did you used to have?

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:43.260
Christmas Day.

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:45.260
That was your lot.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.260
And you'd have a fortnight in the summer.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:49.260
Shut down then, is it?

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.260
Shut down.

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.260
And that was your lot.

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.260
I think you used to get a week in October sometimes.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.260
And then you started going into September.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.260
But that was your lot.

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:03.260
You had no, and your bank holidays, of course your bank holidays.

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.260
Which went so much then.

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:10.260
How did the workers get on with the four men and the four women then?

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:17.260
Once somebody had left, since somebody had become a four woman, would they get a bit up themselves then?

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:19.260
Some of them would, yes.

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:21.260
One has just left now.

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:23.260
Yes, they would.

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.260
Some of them would forget where they'd come from.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:29.260
You know, forget they'd been on the shop floor.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:34.260
Because it should make them a better four woman really, shouldn't it, if they know what the work is like.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:40.260
Yes, but no, some of them were quite, get on and do it type of thing, or I'll report you.

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:44.260
So some of the girls didn't get on with them after.

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:47.260
I got on with them all, I couldn't get a damn what they'd done.

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.260
I mean, that's me.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:52.260
But some of them I know didn't get on with them, did they?

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:54.260
You know.

00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:56.260
Yeah, it's a shame, isn't it?

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.260
Yeah, it is a shame.

00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:00.260
Because it's good luck to them if they can get on and do it.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.260
But, you know, try and be fair with people.

00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.260
I know where you're from, I do.

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:07.260
You've got to remember that their orders were coming from above as well.

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:08.260
Yeah.

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.260
Because like I'm saying, I didn't hit it at one point myself.

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.260
Yeah.

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.260
So my orders were coming from top.

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.260
Yeah.

00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:17.260
And I was only giving what I had been told to tell them.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.260
Yeah.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.260
So.

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:24.260
We've talked about accidents.

00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:25.260
Yeah.

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:28.260
You were saying you had to pay for the gloves, but you've got the money back.

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.260
Money back, yeah.

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:33.260
Can you remember any of the rules and regulations?

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:37.260
I know as far as health and safety wasn't as strong then.

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.260
No.

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:39.260
Can you remember any of the rules?

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.260
You had to clock in and clock out.

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.260
Oh, you had to clock in and clock out.

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:43.260
Yeah.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:44.260
Was there anything else?

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.260
You had to have a pass if you wanted to go out.

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:48.260
You had passes, what they call passes.

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:49.260
Yeah.

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:51.260
Did you tend to stay there lunchtime then?

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:53.260
Because you didn't have much time, did you?

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:57.260
No, we used to get, no, we'd go, sometimes we'd go down to the pub, men.

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.260
Yeah.

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:05.260
Yeah, we'd go down to the pub because there was no such thing as drinking and so we'd have a glass of beer or whatever, lager.

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.260
Yeah.

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:09.260
And I'd come back then, be merry, I'd start up again.

00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:10.260
Fuck.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:15.260
Oh no, it was, oh, pretty easy going.

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.260
Yeah.

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:22.260
Get caught in the Christmas then and I'd have to jump over the fence to get back in, you know, things like that.

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:23.260
Yeah.

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:25.260
But I mean, nothing was in.

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:31.260
How would you describe the humour in the factory then, you know, sense of humour and leg pulling?

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:34.260
Oh, good punter, good punter.

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:40.260
We did have some good, some couldn't take it, men.

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:43.260
You know, you'd have some crying and we'll get on with it.

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:46.260
Would they be the younger ones or what, or just?

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:48.260
No, no.

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:50.260
I don't know, I think it was a mixture.

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:54.260
What type of leg pulling would there be, playing practical jokes?

00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:57.260
Jokes, oh yeah, practical jokes, yeah.

00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.260
They do that.

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:03.260
Because somebody welded my pliers to the table.

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:06.260
I went to get my pliers, I thought that was wrong, yeah.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.260
You know, things like that.

00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:09.260
They were wicked when she was working.

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.260
Yeah, they were wicked when I was working, oh.

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:12.260
Yeah.

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.260
We did have some fun.

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.260
Yeah.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.260
So what type of person do you want to take?

00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:17.260
They put you on a conveyor then.

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:18.260
Oh.

00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:23.260
Or like onesy, they put my friend then on a bloody fountain, water fountain, just sit.

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:24.260
Shut up.

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.260
Shove me in the cage.

00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:29.260
I'd tell you to go to the toilet, throw me a bucket over.

00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:30.260
You know, things like that.

00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.260
We used to have good banter.

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.260
Really good.

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:35.260
So, major day.

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:37.260
And we still had the workouts.

00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:38.260
Yeah.

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:41.260
You were talking earlier about the factory being too hot.

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:43.260
Did it get too cold in the winter as well?

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.260
Yes, it got too cold in the winter.

00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:46.260
Yeah.

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.260
Very cold.

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:51.260
Because they changed the heating, I think, four times when I worked there.

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:52.260
Oh, right.

00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:55.260
They had like gas fires up on the ceiling.

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:58.260
Then they put in this central heating thing that didn't work.

00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.260
Then they'd have to change it.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:03.260
So I think they were spending money hand over face doing things like that.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.260
Yeah.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.260
And nothing worked really?

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:06.260
Nothing worked, no.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.260
It was basically like a big shed then, was it?

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.260
Yeah, of course it was, yeah.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.260
Yeah.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:14.260
What were the facilities like then, like the canteen and the toilets and everything?

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.260
Well, we didn't have a canteen when we started there.

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.260
Oh, didn't you?

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.260
No, no.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.260
We used to sit on little ammunition boxes.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:24.260
You kept your overall in there, your shield in there and your tools.

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.260
And that was your little ammunition box.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.260
Yeah.

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:29.260
Because you had no lockers and nothing.

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:32.260
And then that was your sit down then for your breaks.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.260
Just have your thing.

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:35.260
There was a canteen, mine.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.260
Yeah.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.260
They had a canteen, but that was outside the factory.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:41.260
The time you'd walked up there, your afternoon was gone.

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.260
Yeah.

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.260
So what did you do then?

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:44.260
Did you take apart lunch or something?

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.260
Sandwiches or something you'd take.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.260
Yeah.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.260
Did they play music or something for you?

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.260
They did at one time.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:55.260
They did start, then they stopped and then they started back then.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:59.260
When they first started there, you were having music for two hours a day.

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.260
Yeah.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.260
What, the radio then?

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.260
The radio was on throughout the factory, you know.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:07.260
But then they stopped it, then they brought it back then at one time, didn't they?

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.260
Why did they stop it then?

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:12.260
Oh, because it was interfering, it was supposed to be with your work.

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:13.260
Oh.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.260
Because the rules started changing.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.260
In what way?

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:18.260
In what way?

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:21.260
They started getting bitchy about things, you know.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.260
After they'd been passed.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:25.260
Yes, certain things and they'd start...

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.260
Why is that then? To show the boss was?

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.260
To show the boss was, yes.

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.260
I'm boss, you do as I told, as you're told.

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:37.260
Well, I used to tell them, if you can do this job, I'll do it after you.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.260
Yeah.

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.260
But no, no, I couldn't do that, never done the job.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.260
So who are you to tell me how to do it then?

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:44.260
You know.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:50.260
Did things change then when it stopped being piecework and you had a flat rate then, is it?

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.260
Well, some found it better, but others found it hard. Didn't they?

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.260
You can't say why.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.260
Yeah.

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:01.260
Because they were cheating.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.260
Because they were flogging.

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.260
A lot of them used to flog at one time.

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:06.260
Say they didn't.

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:12.260
But you couldn't blame them then because they were doing the work and it was hard work at that time.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:16.260
So say they'd done 50, they'd book in 75.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.260
Yeah.

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.260
Couldn't they assess that?

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.260
No, listen, I'm going to be in court over this now.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.260
No, you're not.

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.260
They were bloody kicking all the day.

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:25.260
Right, yeah.

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.260
That's what they used to do with it.

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:41.260
And then when the other parts of the factory then were the goody-goody years, they found it harder then because easier because they had already, you know, they weren't doing so much flogging.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.260
As they call it.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.260
Very vulnerable. Can you hear me now if I say it?

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.260
Yeah.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:49.260
I can't, I bet if I don't say it.

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.260
No, yeah.

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.260
No, you went by out on the seats then.

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:58.260
Yeah, very by out on the seats. That's what I was saying, we were very humanised down there.

01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.260
Oh, right, on the seats.

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.260
On the seats. I'm not the pressure.

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:04.260
How did you have by out when we went weekly rates?

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:09.260
Yeah, with, like my husband, we was packing glass of wool.

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:10.260
Yeah.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.260
And it was a dangerous job because.

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.260
Oh, that gets into your hands.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.260
It goes up into your lungs and everything.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.260
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:25.260
Well, I mean, I was working with it because I had to take the work off them to do it and I was welding, which it does more thing for me because I was covered in it.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:32.260
So they sold out their piece of work. They sold out their rates. Well, they had a couple of hundred pound for it.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:33.260
Yeah.

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:37.260
But I was still, well, I had to do it, you know what I mean?

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:41.260
And that's how we do so one little things, little pitchy things.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.260
Yeah.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:49.260
But shouldn't a manager have been able to sort that out or weren't they aware of little things?

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.260
They had to go through the union.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.260
Oh, right.

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:56.260
Because if anything like that happened, the union would be the middleman.

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.260
Yeah.

01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:01.260
Were the union in a difficult position then, do you think, sometimes?

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.260
No, no.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.260
No?

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:11.260
The union were the bosses at that time because, I mean, it was, the union was strong, very strong at that time.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.260
Yeah.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:16.260
So I think it was the union that told the management and told you, me.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.260
But do you think they'll damage things at all?

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.260
No.

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.260
No.

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:22.260
No.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:29.260
Because people today tend to say that unions were too strong back then. Would you disagree with that?

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:35.260
No, not really. No, because you, today you haven't got a union.

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.260
No.

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:43.260
You haven't got a union today because, like I said, I went on the union and you were told, don't make too much fuss.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:48.260
You know, you've got to, which I didn't want to do because, I mean, like I told you, I'm very unionized.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.260
Yeah.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:54.260
I was very militant at that time then. But so I couldn't.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:58.260
Why did you feel like that then? Did you feel that people were taking for granted?

01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.260
I thought that.

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.260
Taking advantage.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:03.260
Taking advantage of other people. And I don't like that.

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:07.260
So where has that come from in you then, do you think?

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:10.260
I don't know, whether it's come from my own background.

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:11.260
Yeah.

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:17.260
I don't know. Because my father wasn't working, I think.

01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:22.260
Maybe because I was taking the mick out of something at one time.

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:26.260
Your father's not working, you can't have this. Let that will have, let he will have it.

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.260
Yeah.

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:28.260
You know.

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:29.260
Yeah.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.260
Have I made you stronger then?

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.260
I think so.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.260
Yeah.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:37.260
Eddie. Oh, again I can never drop it in the court, my throat is hoarse now.

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.260
We nearly finished.

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.260
You'll have to take that off.

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.260
Yeah, I'll get that.

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.260
Haven't you got any in there?

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:44.260
Yes, I've got some in there.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:49.260
I'll just ask you a bit now. You said, you know, when you went there, you met your husband there.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:54.260
So did that work then with both of you being and working in the same place and knowing the same people?

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.260
Do you think that made you stronger?

01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.260
Oh yes, because we used to go out with couples.

01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.260
Yeah.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:05.260
You know, they just, the couples that I'd met there.

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.260
Yeah.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:10.260
Well, we used to go out with them, like if you had a car, you'd go to them couple.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.260
Yeah.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:16.260
And they'd say, welcome now to this. And we all used to go out to the Marshmortar club in the gang.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.260
Yeah.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:20.260
And we'd just go out. You'd fall out now and again with some of them of mine.

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.260
Yeah.

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.260
Well, you do when you're close, don't you?

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.260
But it wouldn't be for long, you know, you could make up.

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.260
Yeah.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:29.260
You wouldn't stay angry with somebody. Because I can't, I've got to.

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:30.260
Make up.

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.260
Make up. Either you like me or you don't like me.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:36.260
Like I say, I make a good friend, but I'm a horrible enemy.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.260
So don't make an enemy of me.

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.260
Scared of me now?

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.260
Yeah.

01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:43.260
But that's the way I am, Gynedd, isn't it? You either make a friend of me or don't.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.260
Yeah.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:49.260
Was there much quarrelling there then? Because working side by side with people.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.260
Oh, Christ, aye. Oh, yes, you used to have quarrels.

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.260
Yeah.

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:53.260
What about?

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.260
About the work.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:55.260
About the work.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.260
About the work.

01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:01.260
About people doing, oh, you're doing that overtime? Overtime was a big thing there.

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.260
Yeah.

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.260
What, that some people have been given a chance?

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.260
A chance to get more overtime than others.

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:13.260
But did some people exploit their power a bit then? Because if you've got overtime to give, right, you've got power then, haven't you?

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.260
Yeah, of course you have.

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.260
Yeah.

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:25.260
So I think they used to. Because at one time it was just, you were told, well, you're working on tonight, well, you do it, you know, if you could.

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:26.260
Yeah.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:35.260
But if you couldn't then, and they'd make a fuss about it, it was either do it or we'll give it to somebody else for the rest of the week then.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.260
Oh, like.

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.260
You know.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.260
Yeah.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.260
So you used to try and take it if you could take it.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.260
How many days a week did you work?

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:47.260
Five, but you used to get Saturday in. There was no Sundays at winter, was there?

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.260
No, later on.

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:50.260
No, later on Sundays came.

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:54.260
Yeah. And how many breaks would you have then?

01:07:54.260 --> 01:08:06.260
Oh, when I first started there. You used to get your breakfast and your dinner. I don't think you had a break after that because, like I say, you could smoke, have a cup of tea on the job.

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:08.260
Yeah. Did they bring a drill? Did they bring the teemachiner?

01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:09.260
No, you had a teemachiner.

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.260
Oh, right.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.260
Yeah, when they first brought the teemachiner in.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:13.260
Yeah.

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:21.260
We've talked about holidays. Did you ever go on holiday with people from work?

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.260
Yes, we still do.

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:24.260
Oh, do you?

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.260
Yes. We still do it. Yes, we've done it for years.

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.260
Where did you go?

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.260
But, Glens, we went in the first, starting off.

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:32.260
Yeah.

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:34.260
Then we went to Spain.

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:38.260
You've come to get on well with people to work and go on holidays with.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:46.260
Go on holidays with, yeah. But I tell you what, I'm still friends with mine now after some of them 38 years, 40 years.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:49.260
So, you understand each other then.

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.260
Yeah. Well, you're more like family.

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.260
Yeah.

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:55.260
You're more like family than your own family. Do you get me?

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:56.260
Yeah.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:03.260
We talked a bit about Christmas at the factory. Before, did people decorate and stuff?

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:10.260
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. We had a good atmosphere. We used to decorate. All the machines had to stop because of health and safety.

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:11.260
Wow.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:20.260
But we used to do everything. We used to put little bells and things on and streamers up. We used to do everything, didn't we?

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.260
So, the last...

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.260
The cop, the cop.

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:26.260
But it was there, right? Make our own decorations.

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:31.260
The last working day before Christmas was the best one then, was it?

01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:34.260
Oh, yes. Well, that was your only day off.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:35.260
Yeah.

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.260
Christmas was your only day off.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.260
So, what time would work stop on that day?

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.260
Well, you wouldn't start.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.260
Oh.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:53.260
So, that's how we had an extra day really because you used to go in by seven, by, well, upper seven, I think it was. Yeah, seven at once. I can remember it as seven.

01:09:54.260 --> 01:10:01.260
But then I think from upper seven, then you'd work until about upper eight and then you'd start drinking then at nine o'clock.

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:11.260
We'd open the bars then. They used to take chickens in and all the boys did. We'd have a party and then the foreman would come round, you can't do this, you can't do this. Give us a drink.

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:14.260
You know, that's how they were. It was brilliant.

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:15.260
Yeah.

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:18.260
So, targets didn't matter or matter, did they?

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:20.260
No, you'd already done your work for it anyway.

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.260
Oh, right.

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:31.260
See, that's what I'm saying. You used to book in. Now, say you'd done 400 the day before. 200 was for that day and 200 was for Christmas Eve.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.260
Yeah.

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:33.260
And you used to book it in then.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.260
Yeah.

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:36.260
So, according to them, you'd still done your work.

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:42.260
Can you tell me a bit more about the social activities in the club? Because you had like a club house then, didn't you?

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.260
Yeah.

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:46.260
Well, it was in the canteen when I first started then. Then it went to the club.

01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.260
Yeah.

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:50.260
But in the canteen, we used to have our dances and things.

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:53.260
So, what type of thing? Do you have bands and stuff or...?

01:10:54.260 --> 01:11:01.260
Yes, I think we did have a band there a few times. And then it was more like records, what do you call them?

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:02.260
Yeah, like a disco.

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.260
Disco, but it wasn't disco then, was it?

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.260
Yeah.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:08.260
A man and a record just doing...

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.260
So, at Christmas time, was there a children's Christmas party there?

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.260
No, we used to have a pantomime for them.

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:15.260
Oh, did you?

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.260
Yeah, we used to have a pantomime.

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:23.260
I think it was in the January, I think they used to do it.

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.260
Oh, they used to take them to the pantomime, you say?

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.260
Well, give you tickets to take them. You used to take them.

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:33.260
Do you have tickets to take them to...? And the old age used to get something out of them.

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.260
Now they don't have nothing.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:39.260
But, girl, nobody gets anything out of them now.

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:41.260
That's how bad it's gone.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:44.260
So, who used to go to the club then? Couples or...?

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:46.260
Singles. Singles.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:49.260
That's a good way to get to know people who aren't on your section.

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.260
Yes, I do see you're carrying on just now.

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:55.260
That's a good way to get to know people who aren't on your section.

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.260
Section, yeah.

01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:59.260
But what if you were on a section and you were stuck with certain people?

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:02.260
Because you can get on bugger sometimes, can't you?

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.260
Oh, yes. If you didn't like them, you'd have to...

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.260
Lump it?

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:07.260
Lump it.

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:11.260
But, like I'm saying, you couldn't hear them talking anyway unless you looked at them.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:14.260
So, I mean, you'd say, no, then, if you didn't, what you got to do?

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:16.260
And you weren't being ignorant then.

01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.260
So, you'd be wading, they'd be talking.

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.260
And you'd think, oh, well, they can't hear me anyway.

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.260
And I can't hear them.

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:28.260
We're just summing up now. We're nearly finished, aren't we?

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:31.260
Were there any sports teams there?

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:35.260
Yes, you had shooting. I was a member of a shooting club there.

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:40.260
I used to do it down in the Tiers place, down in Llellu.

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:43.260
There was darts there, I done darts.

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:46.260
We had knockouts. It's a knockout.

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.260
So, where would that be held?

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:51.260
It's a knockout, it was in the fields in Denham Hall.

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:53.260
Oh, right, yes.

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.260
Well, they had pageants there. I never went to one of them, though.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:57.260
Booty pageants.

01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:58.260
Oh, did they?

01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.260
Yes.

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:00.260
Gosh.

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.260
Well, they used to do a bit of everything then.

01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.260
So, there was a Miss Morris Motors, a Miss Lady, I remember.

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.260
Yes, yes.

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:09.260
Because, what do you call it? Just one, wasn't she?

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.260
Elaine.

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:13.260
Elaine was an attendant for somebody.

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.260
It was a big thing.

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:17.260
I think that was a big thing before I started, even.

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:18.260
Yes.

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:24.260
They used to have Miss Llinellu and Miss Morris Motors in the Llinellu carnival.

01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:25.260
Yes.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:28.260
They used to have durores, the maintenance was a durores.

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:31.260
We used to do Christmas lorries. Well, they'd done them, it's been recently, mine.

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.260
Yes.

01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:33.260
Carnival lorries, yes.

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:34.260
Oh, right.

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.260
Well, they used to be very social at one time.

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:38.260
Yes.

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:41.260
But I think it's going down, I don't think they've got anything now.

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:43.260
Oh, so shame, isn't it?

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:44.260
Yes.

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:47.260
Well, even the youngsters don't come to the club with us, he says.

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:50.260
Where do they go then? I don't think they go out as much.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.260
No, they don't, no.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:56.260
So, did you enjoy working at the factory?

01:13:56.260 --> 01:14:01.260
Yes, I did. I did enjoy it. I enjoyed the company.

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:05.260
The work was heavy, like I say, but you got on and done it.

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:10.260
And certain jobs I did enjoy, but when I finished up I was doing heavy work.

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:16.260
I was doing big gradiators, so I think if I hadn't finished it would have finished me.

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:22.260
Can you just go over your dates with me again? You started when you were 17, didn't you?

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:24.260
Yes, 1967.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:28.260
And you worked then until you were pregnant with the first one?

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.260
Yes, only one I had.

01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.260
1971.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:38.260
I went back in 1972, 1973 in between, because Christopher was a year and a bit.

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.260
Was that part time then?

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:41.260
Part time I'd done for five years.

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:43.260
Then I went full time.

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:46.260
Then they made us redundant.

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:54.260
Then I went back full time then and I worked full time for five years as a temp.

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:57.260
Oh, right, it was a temporary contract.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:01.260
Yes, that's why I was fighting against it and I fought against it.

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:04.260
I think that's how they kept me so long.

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:07.260
So I worked for five years, then I went on full time then.

01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:13.260
How long were the contracts then? If it was a temporary contract, did they just keep on renewing the same one?

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.260
There was no such thing as time on it.

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:21.260
Now there is, men. They've got a year, I think it is a year's contract now.

01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:23.260
I'm not sure what it is now.

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:27.260
You got it done when you were two years in and you fought with it.

01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:30.260
You can't plan anything unless you know how long you've got a job.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:34.260
They'd finish you off a week before the two years and then they'd do another two years.

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:37.260
Yes, and then they'd start you back a week after, or the day after.

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:41.260
Very unfair like that, they were.

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:46.260
If they didn't like your face, like I say, I was two chops here, and they didn't like my face.

01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:48.260
But they kept on having you back, they must have liked you.

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:52.260
Yes, because of the work. They knew that I knew the work.

01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:55.260
Because I started jobs there and I finished them.

01:15:55.260 --> 01:16:03.260
They'd call me and say, I was doing the Princess card at one time, which was a very heavy seat.

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:08.260
Started it off, they went to finish it up then because they were sending it to another company.

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:15.260
Will you come and finish them for me? Sucker be, I used to go. That type of thing, you know.

01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:18.260
So when did you finish eventually then?

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:21.260
2006.

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:24.260
So how did you feel about?

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:27.260
They had an accident before I finished.

01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:34.260
I slipped, I hurt my leg, I was taken to hospital, carried out on a stretcher.

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.260
Never knew I'd be doing that though.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:43.260
That's how I finished then, and I had my redundancy, which they weren't willing to give me.

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:45.260
But I had my redundancy then.

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:47.260
Why weren't they willing? Because you'd been on a temporary contract.

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:52.260
No, no, because I was full time this time. I'd done 20 years full time then.

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:58.260
So they were afraid not to give it to me because I told them I'd take them to court.

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:05.260
But they couldn't stop it anyway because I mean I'd put in for it to do something, you know.

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.260
I'm going to be young for this.

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:09.260
No, you're not.

01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:12.260
No, you're saying that, oh no, my voice is bad.

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:14.260
It doesn't matter.

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.260
It's not what you're saying.

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.260
No, it's not like you're saying.

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:23.260
There's more things happen to Yvonne than me there because I was staying in the same place.

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:24.260
Very boring.

01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:27.260
Only two jobs I ever went on there.

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:33.260
So you finished, was it because of your leg or were you ready to go anyway?

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:37.260
No, no, I was going to finish anyway. I'd put in for my redundancy.

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:40.260
I'd only put in to see because everybody was finishing.

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:43.260
But when I fell I'd put the tin lid on it.

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:46.260
I thought I couldn't work after that anyway.

01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:47.260
No.

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.260
Because I did have a…

01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.260
About two months before I finished.

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:53.260
Yeah, because I had a big bang.

01:17:56.260 --> 01:18:05.260
What struck me talking to a lot of women now is that they have worked close with other women

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:13.260
and sometimes one event sticks in their mind like something they experienced the same time as somebody else.

01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:21.260
Like one of the girls up in the valleys, she said she remembers hearing my Rabber Van, that type of thing.

01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:22.260
Oh right, yeah.

01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:30.260
Another one was much older than you but she remembered hearing the Queen getting married on the radio.

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:34.260
They stopped the factory and they played it on the radio for everybody to listen to.

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:36.260
They'd done tools.

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:44.260
Is there anything, any event that comes to mind when you think about the factory a particular day or anything like that?

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.260
No, not really.

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:50.260
The only thing we got in the factory on the town was when…

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:55.260
Well Terry Griffiths, we were listening to Terry Griffiths winning his championship.

01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:57.260
And his wife was working…

01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:59.260
Lyn was working there at the time.

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:00.260
Yeah, they put it all in the town.

01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:02.260
And that's the only thing we remember that.

01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.260
Oh right.

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.260
That's the only thing we remember.

01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:06.260
There's nothing else, no?

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:08.260
There's something coming over the town, no?

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:09.260
Yeah, don't worry they never…

01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:12.260
What do you remember? A visit by anybody?

01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:14.260
No, nobody would recall it.

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:16.260
I knew the Japanese coming round.

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:19.260
That's normally a bad sign, isn't it?

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:26.260
I know. And one of them went to pick up… what do you call them? They call them things, no men?

01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:31.260
They're red dots when you solder them and they stay red dot for a long time.

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:36.260
And he went to pick it up and I went to tell him and I thought, oh too late.

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:40.260
He said off. He said off, bye.

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:43.260
But I just played the hands and I was stuck to him.

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:45.260
Did he scream?

01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:48.260
Yes, in Japanese, yeah.

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:56.260
So when were they coming round before they took it over?

01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:59.260
Did you know why they were coming round?

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:01.260
No, no, just all…

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:03.260
Because I heard the same thing.

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:09.260
I was talking to a girl who worked in Slimmer in Labrador and she was saying people started coming round.

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:11.260
And it's not a good sign.

01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:13.260
It's not a good sign, no.

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:14.260
Because when they did…

01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:17.260
And saying can we watch you working, that type of thing.

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:20.260
And employing a couple of them. I remember them employing him and shop.

01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:27.260
Because I never forget telling him, and he used to smoke a cigarette, it was the last cigarette for his life, you know.

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:31.260
And I'd tell him, boy you've a cigarette in anymore, you're going to choke on it.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.260
And then he came to work with a collar on.

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:36.260
He must have hurt himself and now forget it.

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:39.260
I said, that fag, they like you, didn't they?

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.260
You know.

01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:44.260
And he'd look good after you.

01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:48.260
Right, to finish then, how would you sum up your time in the factory?

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:52.260
Good, good. Really enjoyed it. I enjoyed my work there.

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:56.260
I enjoyed my time there, I enjoyed my friends there, everything.

01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:58.260
I enjoyed the management sometimes, mine.

01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:01.260
Because like I say, I'd have gone on to with some of them.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.260
Oh, am I going to ask now?

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:08.260
Oh, I've forgotten.

01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:15.260
So if you haven't worked there, do you know, do you have an idea what else you might have done?

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:17.260
Or what else you might have gone?

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:18.260
Because you wouldn't have met yours.

01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:20.260
I might have been a prostitute.

01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:24.260
I might have, you know, would have been easier.

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:27.260
Lay back and take it for wheels.

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.260
Peace work.

01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:30.260
Peace work, aye.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.260
Which peace do you want?

01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:35.260
No, you'd never know, wouldn't it?

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:36.260
No, you'd never know.

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:37.260
But you would have met your husband.

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:38.260
No, I wouldn't have.

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.260
Oh God, this is a shame, eh?

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.260
Keep on, thanks a lot.

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.260
Thank you.

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:51.260
We were doing a bench seat and he used to tell his chap now, and he's a character.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:56.260
So I used to weld it half the bench and he was supposed to be doing the other half.

01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:59.260
So he'd be chatting with somebody now.

01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:05.260
So right, I could see him chatting, so I'd carry on doing the bench now, I'd finish it.

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:09.260
So I'd say to Viv, at the end of the shift, now have you finished it, Viv?

01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:11.260
No, he'd say I have.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.260
I have.

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:15.260
You know, it's half his work all the day, right?

01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:18.260
And I'm still behind, so you work that out.

01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.260
So I used to do it anyway.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:23.260
He was so comic, I don't know if he was Stephen's son.

01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:26.260
And that's one banter I always have with him now.

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:30.260
Then I burnt my tits, but the spark went down.

01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:36.260
I came back from the thing and he had a pair of tits on that thing with a flame in them.

01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:40.260
But that's what I'm saying, good banter with him.

01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:44.260
If I could tell you some stories, I'd be here all day.

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.260
I'd be here all day, wouldn't I?

01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:50.260
I'd be here all day, as I can tell some bloody good stories.
