00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
In the army, one of the stories he always tells me, he wasn't a very religious man,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.280
but I think when you're Jewish it's part of your soul.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.720
And when he went into the army he had three sisters, he was the only boy, so apple of my grandma's eye,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.920
even though she called him angel, that was a bad trick.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.760
And when he joined the army he took his talus with him.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.760
For the members of the Jewish community obviously you'll know what a talus is,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:39.600
it kind of looks like a small table runner, it's white with fringes on and three blue stripes at the end of it,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.360
like a scarf almost. And he took his talus, which was in a talus bag with him wherever he went,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.480
and he went to North Africa, he went all over the world literally, but he always took his talus bag with him,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.120
and he was in some far-flung place and he realized he'd lost his talus, and he was really really upset about this.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.640
Anyway he sort of carried on and apparently a few weeks went by and a young army private came and said,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.960
oh Sergeant Muscovich I found your table runner, and this private must have thought why is this man carrying his table?

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.280
But I do remember that, I do remember obviously both my parents telling me that my dad was sent to an army camp in Cornwall,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.920
St Morgan, St Morgan I think it was in Cornwall, and they went to this particular army camp,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.160
and a few days after they arrived there some young wafts arrived to do a show,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.640
of course my mum was one of the wafts, and after a whirlwind romance he proposed to this young waft.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:58.000
So really I mean it was tough for my dad, it was a hard war for my dad, but those are some of my memories.
