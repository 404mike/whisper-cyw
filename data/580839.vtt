00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
There was what we called the bottom room, which was off the main, off the living quarters.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.120
There were about 20 patients in the bottom room.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.720
Very upsetting to me, very extremely upsetting.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.720
They were kept in this side room from the time they got up in the morning until they

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.000
went to bed at night because they weren't fit for human company is a horrible way of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.160
putting it, but that's the way things were.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.040
So it was distressing for both the staff who did love their patients that they looked after

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.040
down there.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.520
After all, they had nothing to do all day.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.480
The only thing they could do was tear off bits of cloth and that was supposed to be

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.320
some sort of occupation for them.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.480
I never found the worth of that because it was no objective to it.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.400
It was just something to keep them occupied, I suppose.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.760
Maybe I was at fault in this, that I simply couldn't, you were so frustrated in your

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.920
own self that there was very little that you thought anyone would take any notice anyway.
