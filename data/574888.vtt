Recollections of Alwyn Jackson

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
My grandfather told me about coming from Wales as a child.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The family landed in New York City in 1900 and came across to Seattle by train with four children ages from six to fourteen years.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It took seven days.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Before they left Wales, the family was told horror stories about the cowboys and the Indians in the West.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
When the train was a day out of Chicago, five cowboys came on which made them uneasy.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
My great-grandmother told the children to stop staring and be quiet, speaking in Welsh.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
One of the cowboys turned round and looked at her.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
After a while the parents started the children singing, which they had been doing on other trains,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and everybody liked to hear them singing because each of them sang well.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
One of the cowboys turned round and got up and walked towards them, and of course they were scared.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
When they looked up at him, there were tears running down his cheeks.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
He said in Welsh,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Don't be afraid because I'm from Wales.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I left Wales seven years ago and that's the most beautiful music I've heard since I left there.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
My grandmother started talking to him and she found out that he had not been writing home,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
so she told him he'd better write home to his mother and tell her that he was all right.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The first Indians they saw were when they got off the train at Auburn.
