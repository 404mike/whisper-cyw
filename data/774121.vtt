00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
Thank you Foo for agreeing to this interview, Denise. My name is Ewan and this is Bernard.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:18.480
So when were you born? I was born on the 4th of January 1968. And Foo, what's that? In Exeter.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:28.880
So I moved up here on my second birthday. So we moved into Goldfinch Coast on the 4th of January

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:38.080
1970. And we moved up because my father was a mechanic working for somebody in Exeter,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.160
but he had the opportunity to come up with his business partner at the time, Tony Rake Straw,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.960
and they came up together to run the Palmeric Service Station. And Tony ran the petrol side

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.240
of it and the shop with his wife Margaret, and my dad ran the mechanic side of it.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.040
And that's what brought us up here on my birthday. I was two.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.360
So obviously taking them into consideration that you were two,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.840
what did you think of the area when you first arrived?

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.720
When I was little, I can't remember anything obviously from moving up, I can't remember when

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.680
I was two, but my very early days in this street, I remember playing out on that green

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.040
and with lots of children, lots of other children in the street.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.040
So there are two greens in Goldfinch, there's one directly outside my house and there's one

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.840
a little bit further up. And the children from further up the road used to play on that green

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.160
and we used to play on this green. Occasionally we would get together. But my earliest memories

00:01:50.160 --> 00:02:00.880
are of playing hide and seek and games like that and skipping and two balls and various things

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.200
like that out in the green and my mum calling me in because it was tea time and time to come in.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.080
So obviously it's very different from Exeter.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.960
Yes, we used to go down to Exeter a few times a year because all of my family were down there.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:31.120
So my my gran, my auntie's, uncle's, cousins, everybody was down in Exeter and it was only

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.480
my close family that were up here. So I don't remember Exeter obviously from when I lived there

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.560
but I do remember those visits down to my gran and to visit my cousins and that.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:58.800
Exeter is just a very busy city with lots of cars, lots of people but my memories of Exeter

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.080
really are going down to visit my family as opposed to the place.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:12.320
Can you tell me about your parents? You said that your dad was a mechanic.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:22.400
Yeah, my dad was a mechanic. My gran used to say that my dad was extremely bright and intelligent

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.440
and was top of the score or top of his year but I think she wanted him to go on to

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.000
do something other than being a mechanic but that was really what he wanted to do.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.360
So my dad was a mechanic. My mum did work in a printing factory before she had all of us

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.320
and but then she left work when I think when she got married and then she had all of us.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:04.960
So my dad did go into the army for two years to do his nationals and my mum had already had my

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:13.920
eldest sister then, Janet and then I think after he came out she had Andrew and then Sandra and then me.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:25.680
So four of you? Yeah, four of us. There was a fifth but it was still born before me I think.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.120
You mentioned the petrol station in Pwll Merig. There isn't a petrol station

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.240
there now is there? There is. The petrol station in the shop is still there but the mechanics part

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.000
of it the garage is is not there. So that is that the petrol station just outside Pwll Merig?

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:57.600
Yeah if you're coming from Caldecourt you've got the shop on the left hand side the garden centre

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:06.000
and then it's first right the garage first right and I think now where the garage was

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:16.240
where my dad had the pit that is now where there's like a car cleaning thing to clean your car

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.040
and that was where my dad's garage was. Did he continue with that business throughout his career?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.480
He did for a long time. The garage was a jet garage by the way at the time with the yellow

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:42.640
sign. He did for a while but then I remember my younger days we had it just seemed like no

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:50.400
money worries because I had birthday parties and my dad had a nice light blue

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:57.440
jag which I remember yeah I had leather seats and some sort of cassette thing wasn't like

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.880
cassettes as we know it it was like an older thing with like solid cassette thing and all it was

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.880
and he used to play music on it when he used to take us to school but I remember those

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.240
those days fondly we used to have birthday parties and lots of presents and things and then all I

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:25.600
remember was later on perhaps when I was maybe nine ten eleven something like that and the birthday

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:34.160
parties stopped because my dad's garage didn't wasn't doing as well I remember my mum and dad

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.720
saying it was because people were made redundant from lambworn steelworks and it affected my dad's

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:50.320
business so my dad was out of work for a little while but then he worked for Red and White in

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:58.480
Chester yeah and he started at the bottom and he worked his way up and he became union leader

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.120
union rep I think.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.600
How did you spend your evenings when you were growing up?

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:17.120
My younger days very much out on the green playing with my friends and we used to do

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.480
like I said I hide and seek and skipping and tag quite a lot of tag

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:35.520
and I remember we used to make mud pies and I think we got quite dirty

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:49.360
and then in my teens I used to spend a lot of time with my friends I can't really remember until

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:57.920
about 15 16 or maybe a bit older 16 17 when we used to go to the pub and they used to play a lot

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.080
of pool in my late teens.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.360
So did you go to school in Cardacol? Yes went to West End School first infant school

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:16.400
which is down the bottom of the road and my earliest memories were

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:26.000
when I was younger starting school and playing in a Wendy house with Susan Burroughs

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:38.000
who is a black girl with beautiful long long hair and she took me into the Wendy house because I

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.200
was apparently unconsolable my mum told me that she could hear me all the way up the street

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.440
she was walking away I didn't want to go to school so that was West End School the only thing really

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.040
I remember about it apart from that was Mrs Miranda's who is still living and living in

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:06.640
Rockets I believe and my dad used to drive us in the Jag a group of children from the street

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:14.800
and we had to shut our eyes and tell dad where we were between here and West End

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.880
which really wasn't very far and he used to play Valdunigan

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.600
on these big cassette tape things in the car I remember that and that's about as much as I

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.600
remember from West End Infants and then I went to Church Road School

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:44.640
and my mum used to give me a little few pence for the bus to come home but I never caught the

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:54.640
bus on the way home I walked and I spent the money on a Tempe mix-up sweets. So the two schools

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.000
particularly one is infants and one is juniors West End is infants and Church Road is juniors

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.680
it's still the case today yes only they've got different well West End is no longer because

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.200
it's been knocked down recently the school there's houses there now and Church Road is now called

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:23.120
something else and the other thing I remember from Church Road is my mum used to come because I was

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:30.800
very very close to my mum so in West End she used to I think on the way perhaps to the shops or

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:39.600
something she used to walk up the lane which was adjacent to the fence by the playground

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:49.440
and she used to give me little kisses in between the fence in playtime or lunchtime

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:57.920
so used to do that quite regularly and in Church Road Junior School I remember her

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.920
coming to meet me on a Friday because I always wanted her to meet me every day but she wouldn't

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.840
so she used to come up and meet me on a Friday and we used to go down to the village and she

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:13.840
used to get me a magazine called Twinkle this is a little girl's magazine at that time

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:21.520
and she used to get me some sweets and but I remember when I was very little

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:28.480
walking through the village with my mum and she used to stop and say hello to people and they

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.560
used to talk about the weather and I just remember distinctly remember tugging on her hand thinking

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.520
it's so boring when she stops and talks to people about the weather but she seemed to know everybody

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:46.480
in Caldecott which was very annoying because I didn't like her talking to other people

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:53.840
so that was that. So for the listener can you explain

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:06.000
what Caldecott is now you refer to as a village yeah so a change from being a village to a town?

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.560
It's completely different now yeah it's so very completely different

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:20.000
for example when I was in my teens and we used to go up the pub usually the Measure, the Cross,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.280
the White Hart which is obviously no longer there which is very sad

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:30.560
those three pubs were the the centre of everybody's every teenage person's life in

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:40.880
in the 80s and 90s and we used to go up those pubs and we knew everybody

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.120
so you go in the pub and virtually everybody in the pub you would know

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.080
and if you go up the Cross now and there's a band on you'd see many people and you wouldn't know them

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:03.120
and it's a lot busier as well cars wise and people's wise houses the streets in Caldecott

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:11.760
I don't even know now. So those days when you would know everybody there so was that from school that

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.480
you knew them?

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.640
Probably from school yeah probably from school yes

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:35.360
yeah probably the majority of them from school or friends of friends from maybe your year above or

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:45.840
the year above that yeah yeah so on so and it has changed so can you say what has caused that change

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:56.720
do you think? I think probably more people moving into the area in Caldecott

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:05.600
maybe because living in Bristol the houses the rates and everything else that you've got to pay

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.960
all the bills you've got to pay in Bristol so expensive people are coming over the bridge now

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:18.320
and moving in this area I remember when when I was younger

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:28.880
younger there was lots of lots more land around Caldecott as well whereas now it almost feels

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:39.200
like Caldecott, Broggett, Undy, Maga is almost all one place with many many more housing estates

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:48.160
new housing estates going up and I remember a lot of the housing estates being built in Caldecott

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:55.280
and now they've been there for a very long time but for me they're sort of still new but

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:02.080
there are there are many streets and housing developments in Caldecott now that I don't even know

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:10.800
but it was a much much smaller place much quieter place and I think one of the biggest differences

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:20.320
is the downside of it all is there's such a huge increase in crime in this area which is

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:28.960
really really sad because when I was growing up we weren't bothered about locking doors and

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.240
certainly not when you were in the house as well but even you could leave your door unlocked

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.320
go up the village come back and there would be no problem

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:47.600
but nowadays on you know the thing that we've got nowadays is Facebook those Facebook pages that

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:59.440
that kind of I know Ali is is involved in it she she posts or shares the the posts from the police

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.120
locally about local crime and there's almost something happening every every

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:11.840
every day and that's such a shame because Caldecott's always been a wonderful place to live in

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:22.160
when did you leave school and what did you do after that? I left school when I was 17

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:32.240
I did my O levels and then I went to Nash College which is now Colleague Gwent

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.040
and I did a one-year Secretarial course and then I left college and got a job

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:53.680
and worked as a secretary variations of until I was 22 and then I went to run a campsite in France

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.440
and then for six months and then I went to the University of Northumbria in Newcastle

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.720
for four years to do a BA in modern languages and political science political studies

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.120
so

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:25.200
one thing I remember going back to Church Road is a few things I remember it the teachers

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:32.640
specifically and when I was kind of preparing my thoughts for this interview I remember getting

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:40.240
a really bad mark in my maths test it was mental maths and I was always fairly rubbish at mental

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.240
maths and I and I always used to get sort of two or three or four and there's one particular

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:54.160
occasion I got zero and I burst into tears my teacher was Mr Wiltshire and and he tried to

00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.400
console me and he sat me on his knee and it was perfectly innocent even with my memory is is very

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:05.200
clear of the moment because it was not very nice getting zero so it was perfectly innocent and he

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:14.080
was only consoling me and he sat me on his knee and I remember that now I think that wouldn't

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.680
happen these days and that was I don't know whether that was first or second year of the

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.960
juniors something like that yeah and then we had a lovely teacher called Mr Kirkwood that was in

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:32.720
the fourth year and we had another teacher called Mrs I think her name was Mrs Casals

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:42.640
but we used to call her Mrs Casals all the other way around but I wrote a poem in her class and

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:51.680
I won a prize for it and I wrote it about one of my friends Caroline Harris and I won a prize for

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:59.680
it it was a limerick poem that we had to write and we used to have dens in the field that is still

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:07.680
there behind church road school we used to have dens a couple of dens in the trees and I walked

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.280
around there back along and those trees are still there which is quite nice

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:24.000
you said you did modern languages politics what else was it it was modern languages with political

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.200
studies so I studied french post a level yeah and spanish ab initio and political studies it was

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:40.800
comparative politics yeah and so when you finished that what did you do after you finished that I

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:51.120
graduated in 1995 yeah and I met my husband that final year he was my conversation assistant in

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:57.760
university in my fourth year and he had to do the military service in France because he's french

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:13.280
so in 1990 1995 96 we went to France while he did his military service I was a bilingual secretary

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:20.800
in Paris and then we came back because my dad was poorly and we got married quite quickly we got

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:34.080
married in September 96 and then my son was born in September 97 so we stayed here then and I worked

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.560
after my son was born I worked for a computer company in Chepstow part-time

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:48.960
as a sales coordinator and then decided to to completely change my career and go into sales

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:58.320
so since 1998 I've been in sales field sales and my first job was working for

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.480
ADT foreign security in Bristol but covering Bostrakshire

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:17.440
and in the meantime you were you are now living in Caldeco yes so can you say more about

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.720
about Caldeco you have mentioned the changes that have taken place

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:31.680
it's grown bigger and things have changed and you've seen those changes taking place

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.520
and what date would you or is there a date when you could say well I can just see it changing

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:47.440
from that date onwards about you know within five years or something like that

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:59.520
gosh that's a difficult question to pinpoint an exact date or even an approximate date really

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:09.520
because it's been a gradual change I feel yeah for me I would say

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.960
probably when I was

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.120
probably 20s

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:32.880
hmm so I would say 25 years ago but that's off the top of my head without preparing for that

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:46.960
question yeah I would say 20 to 25 years ago but I wouldn't say that all the changes happened at

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:52.640
that precise time but I recall the kind of the changes

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:05.360
I think in my 20s my early 20s perhaps yeah okay and the if we look to the town as it is now

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.400
the shopping area

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.760
um uh the changes have taken place in the shopping area

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.680
probably more recently I would I think um can you say something about those changes that you've

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:32.960
seen and what you think might have caused them I remember there used to be a supermarket in where

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.920
the charity shop is I think it's st. David's um there used to be a supermarket in there

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:47.840
and I used to go in that supermarket with my mum I think was it I think it might have been

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.640
international or maybe international was where

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.480
was where Waitrose is now I can't recall which which one international was but there wasn't

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.960
a supermarket in Colby Cot called international after that there was Gateway that's definitely

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:13.680
where the um where Waitrose is now I remember we had a quick save which is where the clothes shop

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:26.240
is now um and I remember there used to be a toy shop upstairs in is it NSS or the Henderson's

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:36.160
um there used to be a toy shop opposite the um uh the shop next to chapel's chemist there's been

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:42.640
there and my mum used to take me to that toy shop and my uncle and auntie used to come up my uncle

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:53.840
used to buy me puzzles in that toy shop um and what else do I remember I the a strong memory I've

00:24:53.840 --> 00:25:00.720
got is Adams's because we used to my mum used to take me in there to buy me my school uniform

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:08.880
and I quite clearly remember the the desk where the lady was and my mum going in and she used to

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.920
sell all sorts and my mum used to get the wool from there because my mum was brilliant at knitting

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:19.520
I used to knit all my school cardigans when I was little and we used to go in there and she used to

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:25.920
buy the wool and when it came to August I suppose she used to go in there and buy me my school

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:36.160
uniform I remember Adams's quite clearly and and that's all changed totally yes I think Adams's is

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:44.800
is is now a funeral place yeah I think that's where it was um and of course we've got the

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:52.960
pedestrian area we've got Asda which which which on the one hand is good because we needed

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:58.320
a cheaper supermarket but on the other hand it's so sad that we had to give up that wonderful big

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:04.880
school field in order to have a supermarket in Coldicott um that's a real shame because we don't

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:11.760
have that many green areas and you think the supermarkets have affected the um the smaller

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:21.520
traders definitely definitely because there are so many shops now that are empty and again that is

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:28.640
a real shame as well I remember when we were when I was little my mum used to take me to the fruit

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:34.880
shop and we used to buy fruit shop from the fruit shop and we used to buy the meat from the butchers

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:44.800
and um now everybody buys most people buy things from either Waitrose or Asda

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:53.840
and obviously that's going to have a knock-on effect um and Washburns going as well um was

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.120
was significant for Coldicott for the listener could you just describe Washburns and Washburns

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:08.160
was a really really great shop um especially my dad liked it um because it sold um diy stuff and

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:16.320
paint and and various other useful things um and it's just somewhere you could go if you if you

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.280
were doing something in your house and needed screws or screwdrivers or paint or wood or

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.760
whatever you needed to to do in your house you could pop up to Washburns and you'd be able to

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:32.960
get it in there and it was a local family as well and it was a real shame yeah that was kind of a

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:39.200
lot of local people who've been here a long time I think found that to be a shame that Washburns

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:47.680
went so coming back to you you had a career in sales yeah um and so how has that progressed

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:56.080
where are you now with that I got to the peak of my career in April 2016 yeah and I'd worked for

00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:04.960
a company for five years and in that company I progressed um up to international sales um

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:13.760
where it was for a fire alarm company and I was selling fire alarm panels and detectors and

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:20.800
peripheral in peripheral things um and I and I was doing a lot of traveling because it was

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:33.440
international and um I was um looking after Africa Eastern Europe and the Baltics Spain Portugal

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:47.680
various various territories and um in September 2005

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:56.720
was it six um we lost we well one of my colleagues we were a small team of about five or six

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:04.800
salespeople and um one of one of our colleagues got very seriously ill very very quickly

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.840
so can I just stop you on the date again yeah I'm trying to think yeah so but how long ago was it

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:24.880
um I left the company in April this year yes and he and our colleague died in February 2017 so he

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:34.080
was taken ill in the September 2016 yeah and it was and he was um just such a lovely lovely person

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:41.360
very very funny person very popular and he was uh in the gym he worked uh he lived away but

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:49.200
he used to come for uh the regular the monthly sales meetings and the the company was based in

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:55.520
Cumbrian so he used to come and stay over and he stayed in the hotel parkway next to our

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.800
office and he was on the treadmill not feeling very well a couple of days after um anyway he

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:10.080
was diagnosed with with um sarcoma and he went downhill very quickly and we lost him in February

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:24.640
um 2017 um and during his illness and particularly January February is when I decided that life's too

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:32.240
short to work 60 hours plus and I wanted a complete change in my life so I resigned gave him two months

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:42.080
notice and left um in April 2017 and what are you doing now um at the moment I'm I've taken a few

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:53.200
months out to train um so I'm now training and that's swimming gym and yoga um and I've been

00:30:53.280 --> 00:31:01.360
swimming for um since 2004 um but I'm now um swimming a lot more

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:09.600
five sessions a week and I go to the gym twice a week and I do yoga and strength exercises to

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:22.800
get stronger as I'm getting older um and um also in September um 2017 I started a level p

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:31.760
um to learn more in detail and understand about the effect of exercise on our body and mind

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:39.920
um so I go to cross keys college three days a week it's part time and I'm absolutely loving it

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:49.200
so I'm now going to be looking for a part-time job um to bring in some money locally um

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.880
to be able to pay for my training because my training is quite expensive

00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:03.680
um and just coming back to Cardacot um you know you mentioned um about um

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:11.520
the Cardacot web pages um Cardacot community can you just go through for us

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:17.600
the number of um web pages or Facebook pages that there are and what they are please

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:25.760
there are lots and it's I think it's a great thing um this is this is a positive um way of

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.400
bringing people together and sharing information and helping each other and I think that's

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:40.480
fantastic there's the Cardacot community page which has I believe about 7 000 members um there's

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:49.600
the Cardacot memory lane society page um which is all about sharing um history and sharing

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:57.760
knowledge and information pictures um and memories um and again I think there's

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:05.760
five six thousand members something like that on that page and then we have other smaller pages

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:14.240
as well things like um things to do around Cardacot um uh recommendations page I think

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:21.520
there's a page which someone has started fairly recently with less members but um it's for the

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:28.240
people of Cardacot that the were the original original people of Cardacot although anyone

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:34.320
can join it and so there are several pages there are also pages where people want to buy or sell

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:41.280
things but the main ones are the Cardacot community page and the memory lane society page

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:51.440
and I think it's brilliant because um very often every day pretty much people will post something

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:58.160
on the community page and ask for advice or information or help with things or even just

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:04.320
to give each other um sort of advice if if somebody's been burgled for example there seems

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:10.000
to be a lot of that recently they would post it on there and say be careful lock your doors

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:17.280
or if somebody wants to buy something or find something or find out about something um then

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:23.760
then it's on there all of the pubs have pages as well which is fantastic because I've noticed

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:31.440
lately particularly that the pubs are making more an effort to put bands on karaoke quizzes

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:38.400
that sort of thing and they advertise on those pages and people actually go to those pubs pages

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:45.280
to find out have you got a band on this weekend what is it when is it and and I think that the

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.880
measure the cross and

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.360
I think the measure and the cross and the seller are the three most active in doing that

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.960
and when you go to those pubs now on a Friday and Saturday it does seem to be a little bit busier

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.680
because we did have obviously this is very sad the White Heart

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:17.440
um uh got knocked down and uh several years ago now and also we lost the Tiplin philosopher the

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:25.280
tip fondly known as the tip um and that's now being made into residential homes um

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.880
and and we went through a stage where the pubs you go out in the pub on the Friday or Saturday

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:39.280
is absolutely dead so it is nice that these Facebook pages local Facebook pages are they seem

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:46.160
to certainly on a Friday and Saturday with in conjunction with the pubs making an effort to

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:52.080
bring in bands and that sort of thing and and sort of um offering free curry on rugby nights and that

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:57.840
sort of thing um I think it's it's starting to work and get people out again which is nice

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.640
and getting the community together again which is nice

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.320
so is there anything else you want to say to me about um or are you happy with

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:18.240
everything you've said so far I think um from my probably my teenage years upwards I would say

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:24.800
that the biggest change for me personally is the bridge the new bridge we call it we still call it

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:33.760
the new bridge um because at the back of my house we have the railway both lines the the lower line

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:39.680
which is seven tunnel junction to um to Bristol Tampines and the upper line which is Caldecott

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:52.080
Swansea if you like through to um uh Chepstow and beyond um but I I remember when I lived in

00:36:52.080 --> 00:37:00.000
this house with my mum and dad and they started building the the approach road for the second

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:10.240
seven crossing and um my my little boy was very little when that was built and I remember

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:17.440
as they were building it we went over my husband and I went over with my son and we have a photo

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:26.000
of him on his little bike tiny little bike when he was very young um actually on that approach

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:33.920
road um and when when it was first built or even before it was built I remember people coming here

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:40.880
when my mum and dad were in this house and they asked um they were checking sound levels and all

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:48.240
rest of it and they get they offered the residents some money because of the potential noise that

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:55.680
they were going to expect um but now especially on a windy day if you open your windows you can

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:01.440
hear the noise it's like a constant drone of the cars because obviously there are so so many more

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:09.360
cars now than then when it was first built I think that that's one one thing going back a few years

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:16.000
that um that there's a big difference in college and obviously more recently very very recently is

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:24.800
the new school um which which is great in its progression and it's better and it's required

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:34.880
because the old school was so old and um and and so sort of um tumbling down if you like um been

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:42.800
another way it's really sad for people of our era and generation um because it holds so many

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:48.640
memories um and a bit like as they're coming along and taking our school field now they're taking

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:58.400
three significant buildings which have been the center of Caldecott really for so many so many

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:09.440
years um my eldest sister I think she just about made it into that school um when we moved up from

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:16.080
Exeter um but certainly my other sister and my brother went to that school as did I and my son

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:24.000
went to that school um but my my niece now is doing array levels and she's in the new school

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.080
and I asked her what it's like I said what what is the new school like because I haven't been in

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:34.960
there and she said it's quite open plan in the main bit and it's quite so it's quite noisy so she

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:43.280
I think she's taking a little while to get used to it but things have to progress and we needed a new

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:52.240
school um and all new facilities and to sort of keep up with the times so it's important to have it

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.640
but it's also um really sad to see the old one go

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.440
thank you very much Denise for the interview
