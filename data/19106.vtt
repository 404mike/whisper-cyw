Well, in 1929, I think it was, or 30, this Colory closed down.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So as of now, everybody believed it. They were depending upon this place, this area.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
To the old, old, Bumbley's Court pit.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Once that closed well, that was the end of it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
There was nothing now but starvation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And that was a terrible day, unemployment.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, we were all on the side, we couldn't...

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You know, that had got so much into our blood, well, there we were.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I mean, what on earth could they do?
