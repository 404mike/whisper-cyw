00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400
Ah, well, I moved here in July 1969, and in fact I moved the day after the first man landed on the moon.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.400
And the program was going on that night, and I was finishing, my brother and I were finishing packing up the family home.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:37.800
And so we only had a sort of sporadic view of that. So that, I'm amazed that that was the same month as the Investiture.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.800
Because that was the thing that marked it, particularly for me, the landing on the moon.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:57.200
But, yes I watched it, and whether I watched it in the family home or in my present home, I don't know.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:09.200
I can't remember, but I certainly remember the program and the fears about whether there would be some sort of incident.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:19.600
And there were rumours, whether it was true or not, I don't know, that the Queen's hat was in fact a protective helmet, dressed up.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.600
And the fact that Anthony, oh what was his name, before he became Lord Snowden anyway,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that he had designed for himself some sort of uniform for the occasion.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And I remember seeing him interviewed at the Carnarvon Castle, as well as the Investiture itself.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But there was definitely an apprehension about whether anything was going to occur.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So the whole thing was coloured by that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And it all passed over very smoothly, but everybody was well aware that there might have been an incident.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So apart from that, what do you remember seeing in the run-up to the ceremony on television?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:32.400
I don't remember seeing very much in the run-up actually, but possibly that was because I was packing up to come here, probably.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.400
So no, I don't remember the run-up, but I do remember the actual day of the installation.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.400
Were you aware of objections that came across on television?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.400
Oh yes, I think so, yes.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.800
Obviously, had there been anybody planning to disrupt the occasion, they wouldn't be expressing their views on television

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800
because they wouldn't want to be pinpointed.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:11.800
But yes, people who had no intention of doing anything like that did put forward a contrary view, yes, yes.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800
As a Welsh woman, what did the ceremony mean to you?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:31.800
Well, I suppose it was a recognition of the separate entity of Wales and the importance of Wales,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.800
which is something which nowadays I think has increased enormously,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.800
the sort of impact of Wales on the rest of not just this country, but other countries as well, and its culture.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:59.200
And I suppose I saw it as a recognition of that, even though there might not have been much in the way of a practical outcome.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:16.200
I didn't see it as an affront to Wales, which some people obviously did, treating Wales as a subsidiary to England.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.600
I didn't see it that way, I did see it as a recognition of a country.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.600
Were there any sort of events organised in this area?

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:38.600
I think there probably were, but again, I wasn't involved in them, for obvious reasons.
