The units that were built by the government on the Treforist estate, they all seemed to be of one design.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They were very plain, nothing fancy at all, just a utilitarian building.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I think it was about 7,000 or 8,000 square foot.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the building was, it had offices at the front and it was divided roughly into half.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And the slightly bigger half, probably 55%, was devoted to cigarette paper.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And the other 45% was the box making division.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
They made boxes, well I don't know, you could put shoes in them, all that sort of thing.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Although of course they didn't do so well in the wall because on the one hand there was very little new stuff being produced.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And the one thing that you didn't need was luxury boxes.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So they did struggle a bit and the main revenue stream was from the cigarette paper.
