00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, Fandedno, as part of the Longest Yarn

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.600
and I'm talking to Margaret who has a story about her mother and father meeting and getting married.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.600
Yeah.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.600
So tell me Margaret.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:29.600
My mum lived in Italy and during the war my dad was there and I was born in 1946

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.600
which was just after the war wasn't it?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.600
So was your mum Italian?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.600
My mum was Italian.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.600
And your father met her when he was fighting during the war in Italy.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.600
Yes.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.600
And they must have married after not knowing each other for a very long time.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:02.600
Well I think, I didn't find out until many years ago that my mum was pregnant before they got married

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.600
and it was simple in those days.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
She came from a very big family.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
I think there were 16 children I think.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.600
And there were farmers, their parents were farmers.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.600
And of course when she found out she was pregnant she had to leave the family.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:32.600
And so my dad brought her back to England and he came from Devon, he lived in Devon.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.600
But his mother didn't like my mum because she was Italian, because they were fighting against the Italians.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.600
And when my dad wasn't there she used to keep my mum locked in the bedroom with me.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.600
She wasn't allowed to go anywhere else in the house you know.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.600
And so she did have quite a rough time.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.600
That sounds difficult. Were you the child that she was pregnant with?

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.600
Yes.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.600
Goodness.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600
And she locked you and your mother?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600
In the bedroom.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600
In the bedroom.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600
Yes.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600
And eventually did things get better?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.600
Yes, things got better because my dad moved away from Devon.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.600
And moved away from his family so that he would stop ill treating his wife.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600
Goodness.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:31.600
But I didn't realise that the Brits were fighting against the Italians weren't they?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600
Indeed.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.600
At the time. And I didn't realise that.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.600
So as a child you were brought up in a strange dilemma of not knowing quite who you were.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600
Yes.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.600
Especially when your mum was feeling kind of very disconcerted.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.600
Oh yes. And she couldn't speak English you see.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.600
So were you brought up speaking Italian?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.600
I could speak a bit of Italian yes. But my mum couldn't speak English.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.600
So that must have been very difficult for her.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.600
Must have been terrible. Did she survive all this? Did she end up a nice rounded easy mum?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:19.600
She did. But her dad had an affair with somebody who he eventually married and they had nine children.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:30.600
And I think he met her when he was working on the buses. I think he was a bus conductor when he met her.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.600
And they ended up having a lot of children.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600
Oh my God.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.600
But Jean, his wife, wouldn't let me have anything to do with the children.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.600
I tried to see him and everything you know. Because we're half sisters and brothers.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:04:02.600
But she hated me because I belonged to an Italian that the Brits fought against.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.600
You really carried a lot of your life. You've got over it now.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.600
Oh yeah. Oh yeah definitely.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.600
But my mum was dying emotionally. So well.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.600
Well listen, thank you so much because that's a really interesting memory.
