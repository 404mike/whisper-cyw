00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.680
Oh all right. Yeah? Yeah. Just starting off would you like to tell us a little bit about yourself?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.120
Maybe where you're from, what you get up to on a day-to-day basis?

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.560
Um nothing much on a Monday, no. Okay how about we start on where you're from then?

Uh Caldecock. Yeah? 1997, old TV. So it's just outside of Chepstow isn't it? Yeah. For those listening. Yeah.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.560
Okay and how long, do you know how long you've been a part of Chepstow Main Camp for?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.680
No. Not too sure? Is that something Jamie could maybe help? Well Anthony was involved when I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.600
started in 2001 and I think you've already been involved for a few years so you know quite a few

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.160
years isn't it? Yeah. It's got to be 25, 30 years I should think. Yeah. A couple of decades then. Yeah.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.440
Am I, we're looking forward to speaking to you today because Anthony you live independently on

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.800
your own don't you? Yeah. And which is great and you may want to talk about that later on if you

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:38.000
want to about how you find that and I know in the past you've done things with Chepstow Main Camp,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.320
can you remember anything that you used to do? Things socially or? Drawing caps. Okay.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.560
Um well I found some photos and I think you used to do things like sport

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.480
but a specific type of sport to you, can you remember what that was?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:15.120
Um. It was part of a team. Yeah. The Olympics. The Special Olympics is it? Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.600
All right tell us a bit about that then. What sport did you do?

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:31.120
Um. The walking and the shot put. I can't think of anything else. Yeah. Where did that take place?

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.960
Where did the actual games take place do you remember? Um I was the only one represented.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.800
I can't think. That's all right. How about we don't worry about Chepstow Main Camp for now.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.600
Let's just talk a little bit about you if that's all right.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.100
Okay.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.320
I'm just going to shut that because it's a little bit noisy out there. Yeah.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.960
So yeah let's let's go back to Anthony. Let's just find out a little bit about you. Yeah.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:54.920
You enjoy watching? Yeah I'm a poor note watching that. Yeah nice. So um going back to Chepster

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:01.000
Mencap you're obviously been involved with Mencap for many years but you're very independent aren't

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.840
you? You basically live day to day doing your own thing. Yeah. But am I right in saying Jamie comes

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.520
out and gives you some support? Yeah. Yeah? On Tuesday. What type of things do you and Jamie

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:21.800
tend to do together? Oh sometimes going to a really damn drink. Yeah? Yeah. So just like a

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:28.440
catch-up kind of like yeah um what do you get from your relationship with with Jamie?

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:47.480
The companionship? Yeah. Like a good friend? Yeah. Yeah. Just someone to talk to? Yeah. How's your

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:53.720
experience with Anthony Jamie? What type of things do you do? Um well usually it is on a Tuesday

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.720
and I usually go down out and do a bit of shopping or something like that. Yeah. You put some pieces

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:03.160
that you need and then sometimes we clean out your fridge or something. Yeah. Get rid of out of dates

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:09.800
like. Yeah absolutely. And um and he just phoned me up you know quite a bit. I did get quite a few calls at you know

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.040
like right this month and he and but we'll put you out on the phone sometimes as well.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:22.360
So he's someone that that's there for you then Ants if you need a bit of support. Tell you else

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:32.280
I bet as well. Isn't there a bloke called John? John Bowman or John who took you to Porthcoil?

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:41.800
John Bowen. Do you see him regularly as well? Um on the Mondays. On the Mondays what do you do with John?

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.400
Well I just go into the village have a coffee. Yeah. Yeah and then go back.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:58.920
And again is he someone that you can ring when you need support or a chat? No he's busy whatever it is.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.720
Yeah. Yeah.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:11.640
Going back over the have you ever been on holiday with Mencap at all? No. No? Have you got any memories

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.280
that you can think of if you sit and it doesn't matter how long it takes you to to think of it?

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.280
Can you just try and have a think of something that you used to do regularly with Mencap?

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.040
I can't think. No that's fine mate. No sometimes when you've got a microphone on your mind goes

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.520
blank you know. Yeah. I saw some pictures of you with Canoe were on a raft or something.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:39.080
Was that something you did with Mencap? Yeah that's when Tony Brown was here. Yeah? It was a long

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:44.840
time ago wasn't it? Yeah. Let's think back to that time. Let's think so you said Tony can you think

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.120
of any things you did with Tony in particular?

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.120
Well.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.120
Where did you raft from?

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:12.840
Oh so up in the from somewhere I can't think. Down the river Wye was that? Yeah. Did you camp?

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:19.080
Yeah. Brilliant how did you feel about that? Oh I get fancy sleeping.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.400
It's hard work doing a raft isn't it? Yeah. And then camping in between. Yeah.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:35.640
Was it good though? Yeah. So was there quite a few of you there? Yeah. Yeah? Good.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:44.200
So what we've done with a lot of other interviews Anthony is we've kind of asked people to break

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:50.680
down their typical week. So starting on a Monday and then you know ending on a Sunday. What does

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:56.520
a week look like for you? Do you tend to do the same things or is it always different?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.760
Like today for example what would you normally be doing if you weren't here?

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.560
Shopping. Shopping on a Monday is it? Tuesday. Tuesday shopping yeah. Oh it's Tuesday today

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:19.400
isn't it? Yeah. My apologies. So what about a Wednesday? What's tomorrow's plan looking like?

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:28.920
Nothing. Just chill? Yeah. Thursday? Chill much telly. Chill so do you spend quite a lot of time

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:35.320
at home then? Yeah because if it's like too hot I don't go out. No that's fair enough yeah.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:42.120
So so would you say it's quite important for you to see people like Jamie to get that company? Yeah.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.080
Because um you're quite sociable aren't you anyway? I know you go out in the village and talk to him

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:55.000
talk to everyone don't you? Yeah. Okay what about on the weekends? Do you do anything in particular

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:03.800
on the weekends? No. No. Do you find out about events that are going on locally in Caldecott?

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:10.840
No. You don't hear about what they're having on in the village? No. Oh right okay. What about

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:18.120
the castle? Do you ever go to Caldecott castle? No. No. So you've got quite a set routine every

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.840
week then? Yeah. You're quite happy. What's your um what's your favorite pub in Caldecott?

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:32.200
Oh I don't go much. No? We go to the hayway now and again if you ever wanted to meet us up there

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:38.200
for a pint you're always welcome to join us on a Thursday evening. Yeah. Next time maybe when we're

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:44.040
going I can let Jamie know and you can decide if you want to pop up and say hello? Yeah. Yeah so

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:50.040
something good to you? Yeah. Something else we've done with these interviews is we let

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.640
the person be an interview to you ask us some questions is there any questions you'd like to

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:03.480
ask us? No. No? That's fair enough. Okay so say we were sat in a pub together now and we're just

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.680
having a pint what's the type of thing you'd talk about what conversation would you would you normally

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:18.360
have? You don't follow a football team? No. Don't you? No. You don't like football. You don't like

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.960
football? Don't blame you I don't like it either. And you like watching the winter Olympics what's

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:31.640
your favorite um event in the winter Olympics? Oh the track events. The track events is that because

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:38.040
that's something that you used to do and you were interested in it? So when you did the special

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:47.000
Olympics then the shot put did you ever win any medals? I'm not sure. You're not sure? I'm not sure.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:53.160
Well I'll look through the photos we'll see if there's any photos of anything. I can't remember

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.680
of it so once days you did represent Wales didn't you? Yeah. Wow. Was that for you didn't you went

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:06.680
to Dublin didn't you? Yeah I was the only one chosen. Really? Yeah. Wow. Wow. And what's

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:16.360
remember honestly what sport it was? You remember what sport it was? No. Was that a shot put? Shot put and walking. Yeah. Wow.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:24.920
That's quite an honor then Antonique is um on the tv last week oh actually Michael was on the tv

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:33.480
last week and you went down to what? Went to the uh senate in Cardiff which is kind of the

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.520
uh official government building of Cardiff and they have those that are participating like you

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:48.120
did for Wales in the Special Olympics that's been held in Berlin this year so we got to meet I think

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:54.520
there was a weightlifter there was two guys running track there was a lady that was

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.560
uh

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.120
botcher they call it yeah

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.000
but that was nice they were they were really proud of what you know representing their country and

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:18.440
they were going on an amazing holiday so so how was Dublin? Oh. If you can remember that from back

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:29.880
then. It was tiny rig yeah. How did you find did you fly? Yeah. Yeah. How did you find flying Jume?

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:37.960
Oh I don't like going back and up and down the steps. No. Oh really? Yeah. Is that the bit you

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:44.920
don't like? I just don't like flying all together. Have you got many do you collect photos do you keep

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:52.920
photos at home? Have you got photos from like your past or anything? No. No? Just thinking maybe some

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:59.880
visual things for us to look at and talk about might be quite helpful. I can't think. No that's

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.920
fine mate that's honestly we've done a lot of these and sometimes it's just hard to think of things

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:11.320
to say isn't it? So what do you think of the new building that we've got here? Oh yeah.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:17.720
Did you come out at Christmas here as Anthony came out to any of our events?

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:31.720
Came out to the 50th birthday of Endon. Oh did you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.920
A few buses of Prasacko wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah I think you had a couple of the spare ones as well.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.480
Yeah. So yeah we're very lucky to have this building I mean the facilities we got. Do you

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:48.920
remember the Barclay? Yeah. It was about half the size of this wasn't it? I think it could fit the

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:56.920
Barclay in the main room here. Yeah. Did you ever do anything with Alan Bishop? No. No not Alan Bishop.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.600
Right I've got a question for you. What's your favourite Elvis song?

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:08.280
What's your favourite Elvis song?

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:29.960
What's your favourite Elvis song? American Trilogy. Brilliant give it here.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:38.680
That is exactly mine I was gonna say that's mine. You cannot beat that song can you Anthony?

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.000
And when you because I saw you at the pavilion

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:51.480
and you were dressed as Elvis and you were right in the front by the stage weren't you?

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:59.000
And you looked as if you were having a fab night and I can see by your smiling now because of course

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.920
the recorder doesn't know you're smiling but it's obviously a good weekend for you.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:12.440
It's just lovely isn't it to go and watch some live music. Yeah. I'm off to Glastonbury tomorrow

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:20.120
I'll be seeing lots of live music and there's actually an Elvarna an Elvis themed band

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:26.200
so have you ever heard of the band Nirvana? No. No well they were a famous kind of grunge band

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:33.160
in the 90s so it's Elvis meets Nirvana so they play half Elvis songs and half Nirvana.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:39.640
Very odd but you'd probably love it actually. Yeah you would. So he's kind of like a preacher

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:46.280
almost isn't he? The lead singer so they do Nirvana songs but in the style of Elvis.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:52.520
I'd have to show you it to explain it to you but it's very good fun. I'll try and get a video if

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.240
I go and see them and then next time I see you I'll show you. So what else have you got planned

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:05.240
for this year? Any other trips? You've been to Poland? You've gone to Port Cor? Not yet.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:16.440
Don't know what. The end of September I'm not sure what. It's usually around the 26th of September

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:22.280
my wedding anniversary but you've upgraded this year haven't you? You were telling me? Yeah. Well

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:46.760
have you upgraded too? VIP tickets isn't it? Yeah VIP very important Presley. Yeah. Nice.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:55.640
What does that get you then? I'm not sure. No you'll probably get a good view of the stage I'd imagine

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:01.560
and maybe meet a couple of the performers or something like that. Have you already got your

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:13.320
tickets for all the shows? Yeah the office where Chris sorts out, it's all booked up, it's all people.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:20.280
Oh so someone books it for you but then they make sure you can go to all the shows? Yeah. Lovely

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:26.760
answer because it's really hard to get tickets for those shows. So you must go to every show don't you?

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:35.160
Yeah. Do you ever get sick of it? No. No not me. Do you have fish and chips on the on the beach

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.600
front while you're there? Oh yeah I haven't played there. Well the fish and chips and port

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:48.920
calls good. Yeah definitely you're closer to the water. Yeah. And what's the high tide? Yeah. Do

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:56.920
you ever go there for a show? That's in the pavilion. You go to the pavilion you don't go to high tide.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:08.520
And I'll show where we are this year. No. You know where you where I met you by the stalls where

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:14.760
you're buying your belt. High tide is one of those marquees there I think. Yeah. Not sure when

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:23.720
somebody said the fish going. Yeah that was on the news. I don't know if it's gone yet though.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:30.040
No not this year, not this year. But um they're thinking of selling off the land aren't they? Yeah.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:38.120
Be such a shame. But the whole of that weekend you just see Elvis's walking everywhere don't you?

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:47.960
Yeah. Have you ever been to Graceland? No. Is that somewhere you'd like to go? Yeah. You went there on

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:54.760
holiday didn't you? I've been to Graceland twice. Memphis is it? Yeah Memphis, Tennessee. Apparently

00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:02.360
his house is totally untouched. It's just as it was the way he's after. I watched um one of his final

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:07.720
performances the other day and it's stunning. I can't remember where it was at. It's like an

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:15.000
inside the theatre and um he's looking a little bit worse for wear but his voice is better than

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:22.440
ever. It was just a stunning performance. It's an unchanged melody isn't it? Yeah. It's lovely.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:28.360
The king isn't he? All right maybe well is there anything else you'd like to talk about?

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:34.520
No. You don't want to ask us anything because you didn't know. Had you met Michael before today?

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.800
We've met a few times over the years haven't we? Yeah. Yeah. So we see that much. No. I say hello

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:47.000
if I'm walking past but. And honestly he does really like films and quite often he finds me up to

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:55.640
remind me that there's a Rocky is on again or something. Yes. Yeah. I get reminders when

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.720
we're doing a repeat. Yeah. What's your favourite film would you say?

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:08.760
I know it's a hard question because I struggle to answer it. I like them all. Yeah. Favourite

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:17.320
genre? Do you like action films? Yeah. Yeah I love films. That's probably my favourite interest.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:24.360
Sounds as if you're quite happy with your home life with your cat and your films.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:30.120
And your cup of coffee is it? You'd sit down with a cuppa? Yeah. And a glass of water. Glass

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:36.120
of water. Right. Okay. That's all you need isn't it? Is a cat and a good film. That's a nice sorted

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:42.920
for me. Do you cook for yourself? Yeah. I haven't been bothered because it's been too hot. Yeah.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:49.320
Funny enough. Yeah. It does affect people doesn't it? Yeah. You don't want to stand there a heartbeat

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:55.160
in this weather. No. I've been forcing my girlfriend or my fiance as you say to watch

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.560
Lord of the Rings films at the moment. It's the first time she's actually properly paid attention.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:06.200
She's actually enjoying them. I forced her to sit through them twice before but this time I think

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:14.200
I've stocked them to enjoy them. Have you ever seen those films? Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit?

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:20.520
Yeah I've seen them but. They're a bit long aren't they Ant? Yeah. Not your thing. No they're not for everyone.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:27.480
They're fantasies and a quiet taste. Yeah. Is there something like Rocky or? Horror films and stuff.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:35.240
Listen, you and I are just in the cinema at the moment. Maybe doing all the Indiana Jones

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:41.240
things. Okay. Yeah yeah. I look forward to seeing that. Looks good doesn't it? Yeah.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:48.280
Yeah. Yeah I love the old Indiana Jones films. Do you ever go to the cinema then? Oh it's twice as expensive.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:55.960
To its length is it? Yeah. What horror films do you like? I quite like horror films.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:06.840
I get all the wall of ideas at 13th. There's a lot of them out there. Yeah. They're almost comedy some of them.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:14.360
Have you ever seen Hereditary? No. That's one of the recent horrors I watched and it's pretty terrifying.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.960
So if you come across that that's worth a watch. Halloween? Did you see the Halloween films?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:32.200
I see them but. Yeah. Not bad. Obviously you see Jamie most weeks but this is your opportunity to

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:37.480
Is there anything you'd like to ask Jamie? Not at all. It could be anything. Anything you want.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:44.840
No? That's fair enough. Maybe then if you'd like to do this again at some point maybe we can

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:50.280
jot down some ideas or get some photos together that we can discuss. Yeah. Only if you're

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:56.760
comfortable with it though mate. Yeah. Yeah that might be a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. All right well

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:01.080
we're reaching the half hour mark so I think we'll call it a day there yeah. Yeah. And we'll

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:08.680
maybe do this again but thank you very much for coming. Bye. And yeah okay bye-bye everyone.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:15.160
Have you enjoyed it? Yeah. Yeah you've enjoyed it? Yeah. A little bit different isn't it? Yeah.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:22.040
All right then. Very interesting chapter support Anthony so it's good to hear your story as it is.
