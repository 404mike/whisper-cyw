00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.320
Before we start Tony, would you be kind enough for the record

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.720
to spell your name in full please?

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.080
Okay, so it's Tony.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.120
Tony Charles.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.680
Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.880
Tony, tell us how did you first become involved in Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.220
It goes back a long way actually because it goes back to the 1970s

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.360
when we had the Lord Mayor's Parade

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.360
which was a very different type of carnival to what we see in more recent years in Cardiff.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.640
And that came about as a result of a small group of us

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.940
started the South Wales Talking Magazine Association for the Blind in 1971

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.460
and we were partly charged with capturing the sights and sounds of South Wales

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.700
for the blind and partially sighted as part of our objective.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.380
And so things like that going on were very important and popular at the time.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.140
And what I remember about the Lord Mayor's Parade was

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.880
it was much more commercial in those days.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.320
I suppose businesses were putting more money into things like this

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.980
and had greater publicity budgets.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.100
And so you had floats, lorries, flatbed lorries.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.780
It was very much motorised wasn't it?

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.500
Yes and you know you had people on lorries, on the back of lorries,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.540
commercial lorries, the businesses promoting their names through their logos on their lorries.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.920
And also the other thing was we had the military tattoo in those days

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.660
and the military bands participated in the Lord Mayor's Parade.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.160
So that was the beginning and I guess from those early days

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.480
my interest in carnival developed.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.760
That's fantastic and of course along comes 1990

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.380
and Swicker starts the furthest ever Cardiff Mars Carnival

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.840
coming from a very different place from the junior Chamber of Trade

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.620
who used to organise the Lord Mayor's Parade.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.560
I mean first and foremost everything was at a human level

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.240
so we deliberately went for the non-motorised,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.160
being closer to our audience type feel as it were.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.000
So you've seen...

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.600
Yes it's been quite a bit of change.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.360
There's been a lot of change and are you able to tell us roughly when you first

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.600
started taking photographs of Cardiff Carnival?

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.520
I think I took photographs from very much the early days.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.680
I mean I've been taking photographs since I was eight years old which is a very long time ago

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.200
and it's always been for me an audio visual event, audio for reportage for the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.400
South Wales Talking Magazine for the Blind, our monthly sound magazine

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.040
and photography being my hobby and the remarkable thing for me was and quite

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.760
astonishing was that in the late 70s doing the audio side I won a national tape recording

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.360
award for a documentary tape on the Lord Mayor's Parade

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.640
and so it was very much for me audio in the early days but then

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.760
photography I think developed.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.360
What I find interesting is if you try and do them both at the same time

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.800
on that day it gets a bit challenging because you're juggling your visual skills and then

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.760
you know you're trying to interview people and record material but it has changed a lot and

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.840
from that more commercial motorised approach and military approach we saw then particularly then as

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.800
Swicker Carnival emerged all those years ago you saw it become much closer to the public as you

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.360
say and more of a voluntary sector movement which I think has been fantastic for the community of

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.120
Cardiff both the viewers and the participants.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.080
Of course Carnival is a democratic art form we like to talk about its powers of transformation

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.840
and in terms of art it's time-based art I mean because

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.440
and for that reason it's beautiful it's flamboyant it's of the moment but if it isn't captured on

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.280
film or still if it isn't documented then it's lost to future generations and so

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:31.720
I think we first met when I made contact with you as part of Cardiff Camera Club.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.200
That's right.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.360
Because we thought that first of all very cost effective second of all we've got the ultimate

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.000
subject and there's something about meeting you and hearing you talk about the membership and the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.240
activities that made me realise that you know we're all part of the same thing here and it was

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:59.160
highly appropriate to actually have the Camera Club shooting the Carnival this seems quite natural

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.040
yes what was it like getting the idea I mean I know you've been wonderful in sort of

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.680
asking as an interface between our two organisations I know you're grinning at the moment so yes

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.960
okay how did that all come about how easy was it to to to inspire the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.400
the members to come out and and to shoot us en masse as it were I think it was a change in the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.720
same way that the carnival has been through change uh Cardiff Camera Club has been through change I

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.000
mean traditionally it was very much a club where you went along one night a week sat down maybe

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.080
had a lecture or maybe a monthly competition or something like that and then you went home

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:42.360
and I think what tended to to to change things was that that the club started to become much more

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.480
involved with the community and my job as honorary press officer was not only to sort of liaise with

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.920
the media and raise the profile of the club but also to try and think about how we could work more

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.560
with community organisations and that had a you know a two-way street situation a win-win situation

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:06.440
because on the one hand it was giving amateur photographers a chance to do some good photography

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.200
hopefully giving them the the opportunity to shoot some interesting things but also then in

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.960
terms of the organisations the voluntary groups giving them some material that would help them

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.960
with their publicity no no and that's very true I mean one of the things I loved about yourself

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.320
and the Cardiff Camera Club is the quick turnaround I mean you know so we would do

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.040
carnival normally on a Saturday by Monday we would begin to have a flow of images

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.240
and certainly that would help beat the post-carnival blues where suddenly you've been

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.640
through this experience and and you know bless them there's suddenly there's these discs arriving in

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.480
our pigeonhole in chapter and we're reliving the highlights of the weekend and so you know that was

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.080
one of the many things I enjoyed working with the Cardiff Camera Club. And the thing with amateur

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.360
photography is that you know you're not doing it commercially for a client where the client is

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.480
dictating what they need for example a wedding is a typical example you've got to give the married

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.640
couple what they want. I think with amateur photography it can become much more of an art

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:13.720
because you have that freedom to do it how you like and I mean what I've seen each year about a

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.080
dozen members of the club shoot the carnival from beginners to very experienced members some have

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.680
worked commercially as well as professionals in the past but what I see is a range of different

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.840
approaches by those people so you've got people with different styles and for me what that gives

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:38.280
Swick a carnival is a spectrum of artistic output as opposed to perhaps one commercial photographer

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.320
doing a shoot in his particular style. Yes you might have one somebody's into portraiture

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:49.720
someone else is going for the crowd shots yeah and uh there was a you know obviously shooting in the

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.680
urban environment where we're parading through the streets of Cardiff I know that you and others

00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:00.840
have found various vantage points but we still think uh that there's well there was a shot which

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:06.840
is known as Tony's shot uh and this is where you uh yeah what's it like from the keep of the castle

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.760
looking down St Mary's street at hundreds of costumes because it was it was a brainwave you

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.320
know we couldn't get you up in a helicopter you know you're too big for a drone I can't use a

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.280
drone no I think it was really probably going back to my commercial business background in the

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.400
second half of my career and you think you know you're a charity you're after sponsorship you're

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:33.320
after money and so what would somebody putting money into a carnival want they want the context

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:39.320
with when and it's not a couple of people on the pavement in church away Cardiff looking at a few

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:46.360
people going past it's thousands of people uh for example looking up from the top of Cardiff castle

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:52.440
entrance up St Mary's street uh High Street St Mary's street seeing you know the thousands of

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:58.920
people jammed you know up against the the the shop windows right up to the barriers the pavement

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.720
and then the carnival with lots of people in different groups coming down so that was almost

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:11.240
a helicopter view and then of course you've got the up close um and personal um context as well

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.400
where you're looking at people in groups or individually which again with the colour

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.120
and costumes that so much thought and design goes into into them with your crew

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:27.640
it gives a very different visual experience but what I've also seen is something that's quite

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:35.560
different and probably people don't acknowledge or don't see as one of the other benefits side

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.120
effects of Cardiff carnival and I've talked to a lot of people in the carnival over the years

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:47.080
they say don't click uh with your camera until you've clicked with the person you know so talk

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.320
to the person yeah yeah I talked to a lot of people over the years you know because if you're going to

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.120
shoot them you want to know a little bit about them perhaps and what I found is I've had people

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:04.040
say to me I came into this as a volunteer and did this and it changed my life um I was down um I'd

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.760
been through a bad experience something had happened in my life and by joining the Cardiff

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:15.000
carnival team going to the workshops and taking part in the preparation and being with those other

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.480
people actually got me back on my feet and I've heard people say that sort of thing now most

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.840
people watching the carnival wouldn't realize but there are all sorts of if you like tangents

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:30.760
undercurrents going on within the carnival that I think too is is is absolutely fantastic in terms

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.240
of what the carnival does for Cardiff and individual people I think that's fantastic I mean I think

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:41.560
your reference to the the healing power of of creating things collectively and then twice

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.760
bless showing it in the in the public domain and adding a bit of color to our austerity struck

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:53.880
streets streets it's uh it's it's fantastic um well uh obviously uh this interview will form

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.560
part of the archive as will hundreds of thousands of photographs many of which you personally helped

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.840
us bring about through the relationship with the Cardiff camera club and we're very very grateful

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:11.720
for that uh obviously we sit here slightly saddened by the news that of course swicker carnival

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:19.080
with withdrawal of arts council funding will now be closing um what what are your what are your

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.640
thoughts on that I mean uh I'm very sad about that because uh being part of the welsh charity

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.880
movement myself as a founder member and a volunteer for 44 years with the south wales talking

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.160
magazine association first of all I realize how important it is for voluntary and not-for-profit

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:41.480
groups to get funding these days so that is an issue in these times of difficulty and yet we're

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:47.320
one of the richest countries in the world so there's a you know a bit of a dilemma there in terms of

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:54.120
you think well what's going on now Cardiff is a very modern expanding progressive european capital

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.480
the foundations were laid through the wisdom of the city forefathers and we've got to continue that

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.360
I mean over the last five years I've traveled quite extensively uh particularly in europe and

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:12.280
abroad to cities like uh Rio in Brazil um Accra in Senegal a lot of the european cities Lisbon

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:18.680
Barcelona places like that and if somebody said to me Tony where would you prefer to be it would

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:24.760
always be Cardiff we're a modern european waterfront city and we have to invest in the

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:31.480
arts we have to invest in the future and I'm very sad when I hear of arts and voluntary

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:37.960
organizations having these financial difficulties which seem to come up so often these days so I

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:45.320
would very much like to see some sort of rebirth some phoenix from the ashes come out of 26 years

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:50.840
of Cardiff carnival and see something continue in the future as we continue to try and develop

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.960
Cardiff as a leading european city on that hopeful and optimistic note can I just say

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.920
Tony it's been a joy working with you over the years and I wish to award you the invisible but

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:10.680
eternal accolade of a hereby W a Cardiff carnival hero thank you very much Tony thank you
