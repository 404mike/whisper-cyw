00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
So you didn't take your father's footsteps and go into forestry then?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:12.000
I would have actually, I was quite interesting, but there was a, I think my father was recommending

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.760
that there were too many people in the forest, too many managers in the forestry at the time,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.680
and that there were lots of people after the war who kind of gone into the forestry after

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.640
kind of having roles in the army and things like that, because it was that kind of operation where

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.200
it I think suited those kind of military-minded people, I think.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.640
The Forest Commission didn't always have a happy kind of relationship with third parties and things

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:51.200
like that, particularly the farmers, because the drive to get the land and to plant the land with

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.840
trees was so strong after the war, because kind of prior to the war, even though the Forest Commission

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:10.240
had been set up in 1919, it was its anniversary last year or centenary, it had to acquire the land.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.240
It was only about 10% of the total timber kind of usage in the UK was coming from home soil,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.320
90% of it was being imported, and even after the first, they realized there was a problem

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.640
after the First World War, because they chopped down every tree going pretty much in the First

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.160
World War, because the kind of wars apparently take a lot of timber, as well as kind of going

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.880
to rebuild things after them. And in the First World War, they needed wood for cordite, which was

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.200
kind of used in the shells in the psalm and things like that, it was a kind of a source material for

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.960
that. But even after 1919, when they said we're not going to do this again, we're not going to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.680
get caught with a pants down, kind of having no way of having the timber we need to kind of

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.760
manage and save ourselves. And then within a couple of years, they had a plan to plant

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.480
millions and millions of acres, I can't remember if it was two or five million acres of trees

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.360
in the UK to get the resource back. But within a couple of years, some change of government,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.160
and somebody said, well, that's costing us too much money. And they pulled it back. So by time

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.240
the Second World War came up, they still had about 10% of homegrown stuff, and they were still

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.920
importing 90%. And when the war, a lot of that was coming from Scandinavia, across the North Sea,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.400
there was some from Africa, but bits of Asia, sorry, bits of Europe, but obviously Europe closed

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.160
down fairly quickly during the war for a source of anything. And once the U-boats and things like

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.480
that were out in the seas, then we couldn't really import wood readily from Scandinavia,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.440
particularly when some of those countries were taken over by the Germans anyhow.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.840
So they suddenly realized that during the war that this was a big problem. And once again,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.000
they sat down and said, we mustn't do this again. So they had another plan to have a five million

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.120
acres of trees planted and got going on there. And that was the drive that my dad got onto,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.280
I suppose, at the time, that the need for forgetting the trees planted. It was a policy

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.840
at the time. It was supposed to be an insurance policy, because they said, well, okay, we're not

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.520
supposed to have another war. But if we do, we're going to be in exactly the same position,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:41.760
or even worse, because we chop down every available tree that's worth having at that time. And

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.480
obviously, once after the war, there was a massive rebuilding program. And even though

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.760
modern materials are coming through, timber is still used massively in any kind of building

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:03.600
program, be it industrial or domestic houses. So yeah, they got through that.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.800
So yeah, a lot of the trees, when you look at them now, I'm not too sure if they're ideal for

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.360
the modern requirements. But the good thing to see is that there are sawmills and things like

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.960
that now locally. Whereas before, the nearest place for any timber in Wales to go was the pop

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.160
mills in Ellesmere Port from places, you know, miles away. But kind of the trees as well were

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.720
aimed at very much the pit props. A lot of the trees planted here, they wanted fast growing trees,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.960
but they could keep the mining industry going, because that's what drove the steel industry and

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.560
all the rest of it. And at that time, they could see that that's what was needed was fast growing

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.200
timbers that would allow them to get back to a reserve of some timber at least,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.400
letting that same stuff grow on. But it wouldn't necessarily be the timber you'd be growing now for

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.280
perhaps what modern demand is, I don't know. The thing I find is that the sheer amount of effort

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.960
and work that went into putting the trees where they are and to make them grow. And I know my

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.280
father used to have quite a bit of conflicts every now and again with the local farmers who

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.400
still had to shoot back into the forest to graze and things like that. Yeah, of course. And they,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.880
a part of it, there are things like, for example, the cut to meat, they started to become

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.840
more appreciative of what the local farmers were saying. They were saying, oh, these forests, you

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.520
fence off all these lands. All it does is breed foxes that come out and take our

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.520
lambs and things like this. And you've got loads of little crows that keep going, what are you

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:57.040
doing about this? So they then kind of had programs to try and control it. And Joe Williams,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:05.280
Lindsay Williams, his dad was the trapper. Right. I don't know. Yeah. But I suppose he was

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.600
responsible for keeping down the vermin and the foxes. Yeah. So there was lots of little things

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.360
like that going on. And when we were young as well, the RSA rally used to use the forestry roads.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.960
They haven't done now for a number of years, but in places, if I still go around there now,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.400
I can see the bends where the RSA rallies were coming around because the contour of the bends,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.880
because when they made the road originally, they'd be graded and all the roads would be that shape.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.440
But on the bends now, where you see it, there's a lovely camber on the bends. And that camber has

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.800
been made by when the RSA rallies used to go through, they threw all the gravel from one side

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.960
to the other side of the road. And you get a nice little little camber on the bends in place.
