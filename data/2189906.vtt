00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm in Holy Trinity Church, Fandedno, and I'm talking to Lance

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.440
Jones who is going to tell us about his father's involvement in building the Mulberry Harbour.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.440
Thank you, Lance.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.340
Hi. In fact, it was my grandfather, my Tide, who was the guy involved. His name was Charles

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.720
Price Williams, originally of Shridlan, and then was living in Abigail with my nine, his

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.860
wife at the time. He was born in 1907, so he was actually too old to fight in the Second

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.040
World War, but as a blacksmith, he had a valued occupation. And so having built landing craft

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:48.880
and helped repair bombed out places like in Birmingham and in London and so forth, he

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:56.440
was then brought on to help build the Mulberry Harbours and the structures related to Mulberry

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.960
Harbours at Conwy. Still living at home, whereas he previously lived in compounds and accommodation

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.320
when he'd been working in Birmingham and Glasgow and so forth. In Conwy, he was helping to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:18.160
build the Mulberry Harbours near Quimham and for the Mulberry Harbours. So he was very

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:27.400
proud of what he did, and I know he felt somewhat, he felt the fact that he was too old to fight

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.900
and others that he knew were going to fight, but in his way, he was doing the bit that

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.920
he could, and he was proud of what he did do.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.680
So he didn't live in the, because many of them were in the old convalescent homes in

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.680
Tuganoa and around, but apparently he traveled in every day by train, presumably.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.280
Yeah, I believe that, I mean, I know that he was based from home, he never talked about

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.880
having lived away, and of course, there's a train station in Naba Gala and there's the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.760
train station at Llandudno Junction. So he never talked about living away, so I just

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.760
always suppose.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.960
He may have walked actually from Llandudno Junction to the Mulberry, it wouldn't have

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.680
been that far to go on over Telford's Bridge. So did he know what he was building? They'll

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.680
say they didn't.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.560
Yeah, well, he always talked about it, sort of very much in the past tense, and I think

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.160
it was only at the end of what they'd done, they realized that they were building these

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.880
Mulberry harbors. They were just, you know, structures of steel, weren't they, that they

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.960
were making, but for what he didn't know, I don't think.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.880
And you don't know which year he started, because I wondered whether he had been building

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:49.600
on Joris Hughes's original Hippo and Crocs, or whether he actually built the three pierheads.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.480
So I don't know. I don't know what year he started in Conway on the Mulberry Harbour,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.960
so what I do know is that he pretty much worked right the way through from 1940, doing war-related

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.600
work and being taken from one place to another place to help rebuild and construct, if you

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600
like.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.320
I'm very proud of his war work, because he was an older man, and he'd given his time

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.080
and his older years to construct something that was very important in the war and all

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.560
the other things that he did.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.720
And my Tide was a great storyteller, so he always had a story to tell about everything

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:36.880
that he'd done. I think, unfortunately, because I moved away to go to university, I used to

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.960
see him every morning because I was his paperboy. So every morning I'd have 20 minutes with

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.360
Tide and we'd have a cup of tea and so forth. When I moved away, he was still there, and

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.200
I asked him, rather than actually lose the story so I don't hear the stories and so forth,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.920
I gave him a book and a pen to write stories down. But unfortunately, he kind of got through

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.360
his early years in the book, so he talked as a child, but he never really wrote his

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.600
life as an adult. So that's a bit of a...

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.600
A bit of a regret.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.240
So you don't have his wartime...

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.800
I don't have his wartime records.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.880
So did he get a medal at the end of that? Any commendation?

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.800
No, not that I'm aware of at all.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.920
And yet his war work was really important.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.600
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.640
And he survived it and he was cheerful and well afterwards.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:30.360
Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. He was fine, absolutely fine. And it's interesting that the family

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.160
was on my mother's side of the family. The family after that, they all served, they were

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.640
in all of the services. And my father's family are all from Royal Welsh Use of Leers, going

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.160
all the way back to the 1700s. And in fact, they have got their medals, particularly from

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.760
the First World War in the Regimental Museum in Carnarvon. But that's not tied to us.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.400
Such a lovely story about your time. And I know they did very long hours. It must have

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.880
been very tiring because at the end of a long day, he had to get back on, presumably get

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.400
on the train and go home. But I'm glad he survived it and put stories about it.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.640
He was a very strong man right the way through into his mid-70s. And he used to proudly

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.680
challenge me to an arm wrestle. When I was 18 and playing rugby at school and for the

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.320
town, he would challenge me. And I remember in the last years I was 18, he was 74 and

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.600
he challenged me to an arm wrestle and I couldn't beat him. And I was a big lad.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.480
I'm so glad. He was so strong even at the end of his life. Such a lovely story. Thank

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.480
you so much.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.980
You're welcome.
