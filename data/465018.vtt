Did you see the strike as a Welsh strike or as a British strike?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Oh, a British strike, I think, because a lot of the coverage was from other areas, wasn't it English areas?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In fact, I can't offhand recollect any in Wales being shown. There must have been, I presume, but I can't remember them.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Certainly, that wasn't the dominant area that I saw.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Did it have an effect on the community here?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well, I'm not certain about that because I'm not certain when the minds, the individual minds around here closed.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.000
My impression is that a number of them had closed already when this started, but I wouldn't be certain.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There would be one or two that were still in operation, possibly only one, I don't know.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But, you know, I wouldn't be certain enough to.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Thank you.
