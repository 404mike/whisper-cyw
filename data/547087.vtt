00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The great and love the Lord, And glad eyes below, below.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Join in a song with sweet accord, And our hearts surround, surround the throne.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Invent with fervent wind, The eyes shall live not falling.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And last in our relief all good, Hail to your house in Rosary.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Holy in the virgin land, The bright and sun-tired land,
