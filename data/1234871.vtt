After the ceremony we had the wedding breakfast. It was you and me and steak and everybody else had...

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but they said the chicken was lovely, didn't they? And there was one guest who the remotes were brilliant

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and they looked because I had it all down for him and gave him ice cream.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Then you had different pudding, everybody else had profiteroles and the starter was...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Did you feel any different having now become married? Did it feel like a relationship? Did it feel different in any way?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I don't know if grateful is the right word but because of all the obstacles we faced, to be honest, it felt a relief.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But that was purely because a lot of people would say, well, of course we would jilt, of course we'd be lying if we said we weren't,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
because of course we were over the moon. But there was also that element of relief as well because we never thought we'd get there.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And it was such an uphill struggle. But we smashed them all out of the park, didn't we?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We did.
