WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
yourself and tell their names.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Ok, good afternoon, I'm Mrs Christina Roy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:20.500
Today we are going to organize an oral history interview with Mr and Mrs Majumdar for the

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Wales Puja Committee for taking the past memories and the history of heritage of Dunga Puja

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500
in Wales.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.500
Good afternoon Mrs Majumdar.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.500
How and when did you get involved in the festival for Wales Puja Committee?

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.500
Ok, I think to be honest you don't remember because it's such a long time ago but as far as I remember

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.500
I got a phone call one day I think from in Cardiff you know there were two gentlemen Mr Godock

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.500
and I think Mr Shambudar all of a sudden they saying that the Boudi I need you, we need your help.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
I said what, what sort of help?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.500
My husband was busy at that time you know he was a single handed practitioner he was.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.500
So unfortunately he was not home so I had to answer the phone and everything.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.500
So he said could you please we are going to start the Puja in Cardiff but we need some stuff for the Puja.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.500
Have you got this Kosha Kursi, Chandan Khar, all the Puja thing you know utensils for Puja,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.500
ala shak all these things. So I mentioned whatever I got and decided the date mentioned and all that was fixed anyway.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.500
At that time there was no committee, no meeting, nobody, only few family.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.500
The initial started Mr Godock and Mr Shambudar but they invited few family I think you will know

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:08.500
already you know perhaps Mr and Mrs Kaur, Mr and Mrs Mishra, Dr Animesh Das, Mr Pali, ourself and Dr Boshak.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
All these family the only the oldest I think.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.500
And Mr Mishra, Mrs Mishra I told you.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.500
So few family they invited and I think Dr and Mrs Haldar whether they were there as well isn't it Amadari.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:37.500
So they were involved in the beginning so they few families came and they said that whoever the Bengali or Indian you know you tell them we are doing the Puja.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.500
So instead of family oriented Puja only few families started.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.500
So we didn't know anybody what's going to be like that and all.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.500
So whatever I thought I saw the Puja in our house in India.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.500
My mother or grandmother whatever they used to do in Lokthi Puja or in other Puja, Sharshwati Puja we had in our house, Dugga Puja also in our Desh.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:08.500
So I remember all the things you know Puja fruits, cuttings and what sort of things we need, five fruits and sweets and things like that.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:19.500
So that was arranged few people took share the but most of all arranging and telling everybody what to do not to do those two gentlemen was doing.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:27.500
And we are sort of working but it was nice good experience and we are excited that we are going to have the Puja there.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.500
And we had the Pruthima the first one someone came I can't remember the name the gentleman you might know afterwards.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.500
Mr. Parth.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.500
No she had a picture a painted picture the first one.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.500
I think you might have in our old pictures that that the first Pruthima was painted.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.500
They brought it in parade and we started the Puja there.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:02.500
What she has done she has jumped few stages.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.500
We hope that couple of other things happen.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.500
Yeah what things happen.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.500
But whatever is in the school and other things then you can't get parade like that.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.500
You have to we did series of places then came the parade.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.500
Excuse me.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.500
Art come again okay.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.500
The same one.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.500
Challenger.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:32.500
So what were the major challenges you faced while arranging or organizing the Puja around those times.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:43.500
I think the beginning it was the main factor that when we started finding that you know we spent quite a lot of time in the morning and in the evening time.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.500
The first thing obviously everybody gets hungry.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.500
So food was the main thing factor we get the Prasad fall and fruits and everything.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.500
But gradually we started you know thinking in the evening time a lot of people started coming.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.500
I mean outside Kadi, the Bristol, Newport.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.500
So the audience was coming up.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.500
So then everybody thought the collection was also coming up.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:15.500
So we thought we better give the order the food and with the few family members we were paying more contribution at that time for the meeting the cost.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:25.500
So the food was coming and then gradually when the member came quite a lot and we decided to make a formative committee was formed.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.500
The main factor was beginning you know the food that started with that then you need money.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.500
So how to get about that.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.500
So everybody had a decision.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.500
Ask him.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.500
The thing, committee was not formed so easily.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:06:00.500
There was always a controversy that one person I don't want to name he doesn't like the committee.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:10.500
So committee he said no we are doing Puja and we are collecting money everything.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:20.500
They let the people come and enjoy it and whatever confidence and this is only we will control not the committee.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.500
So were there any issues of money?

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:34.500
Then the some or other that gentleman is gone out.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:41.500
Then came two other people.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:49.500
They said yes there is a committee to be formed and specially Dr. Banerjee was came without committee.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:58.500
So how can you and how you can handle public money and the public has every right to know how you spend that money.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.500
So you will have to give a chart after the Puja and let them see what you have spent.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.500
So everybody thought it was a very rational and reasonable judgment.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.500
So some or other the committee was formed.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.500
And that's it.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.500
So what collecting the money?

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.500
What would you think like the money came through?

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.500
Did all the members put in the money or was there a policy to get more donations?

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.500
We didn't have much money in our fund.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:41.500
Whatever we got the fund at the end you will see there was always a deficit.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.500
So we managed the deficit ourselves.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:54.500
So at the end they decided that you better go everybody's house and collect the money.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:07.500
Initially you can see that who are the people who has much interest in the Puja and come with a much more reverence and what you call bhakti.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.500
They are the people.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.500
They are with us.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.500
So you go first and then you go other people.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.500
So we started.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:25.500
So we formed a group three or four, four or five and in the car they will go.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:31.500
And the response was that nearly 50-50.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:37.500
I don't want to say anymore because few checks are bounced.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.500
So we don't want anymore.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.500
And somebody may say by checkbook I can't see it.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.500
Find any checkbook.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.500
So these are the experience we had.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:56.500
Somebody said well next another Puja is our Puja that is Navaratri.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.500
Their food is better than yours.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.500
So no.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.500
So these are the experience we had.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.500
And we have to say when you get your checkbook we will come again.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.500
So this is our experience.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:17.500
But there are people who lavishly give the money without any question.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.500
So there is a two contrast between the two.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:26.500
Anyway this was the collection started.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.500
But at the end when our fund has grown up gradually and people are coming and coming.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.500
Only 20 people started.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.500
Now there is 50, 60, 70, 80 people.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.500
Then we said we stop collection.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.500
Let them come and whoever like to give money.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.500
Collection of the whole.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.500
Not our whole too.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:59.500
So we said we should appoint chairman, vice chairman, accountant.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.500
There was a controversy whether you should appoint an accountant.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.500
Some said there is no need.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.500
The treasurer will do the job both.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:18.500
And you must show that there is account to be shown to the public.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.500
And let the public have the say in the annual general meeting.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:36.500
Then the conception of the registration of the committee.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:46.500
Some friends, one or two friends, they started with the solicitor.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.500
And with a discussion with him.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:59.500
But ultimately it was rejected in the registration of the SINC in Liverpool.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:06.500
They said it doesn't comply with the regulations and others so it can't be registered.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:13.500
Then at the time one member of that committee died.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:24.500
And at his last work to me was that I can't do it and I'm going now in Villander hospital.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:31.500
So you take the charge and do the registration as you can.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:37.500
So I said well when you fail how can I do it?

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.500
How can I do these things?

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.500
Alright. Then I took it.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.500
And he died next day.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.500
Then I thought very much.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.500
Then I went to the Kachisomans.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.500
They registered.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.500
Then the other, those who were registered, I took a note from them.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.500
These are the way to proceed.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.500
And then same solicitor.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:13.500
Then I invited Dr. Sharma, Kishore Sharma.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.500
And we had a meeting in our house a number of times.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:26.500
And again we met Mr. Rol, solicitor's name?

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.500
Rajavoljab.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.500
Rajavoljab.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.500
He said oh well it can't be done.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.500
I said yes it can be done.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.500
This is the way to go through.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:42.500
So he had thought about it and then he corrected all the forms and applications and everything.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:52.500
Then there is a covenant that you got to pay contribution to any earthquake or anything.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.500
You got to show that you have given them.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.500
And you got to show cultural things.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.500
Something cultural going on.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.500
And you must give accountant all accounts.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.500
And then it will be passed.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.500
Then ultimately passed.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.500
Ask a question on the constitution.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.500
I think the constitution is over.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.500
I think we told already about constitution and all the things.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.500
I know the committee was formed after a while.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.500
But did you have to form a new constitution to run the committee?

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:33.500
When this question of charity when arose and deeply we thought about it.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:44.500
The first important part of the charity in the registered office in Liverpool they will ask the constitution.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.500
So we got to run a constitution.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:58.500
And as Sandeep has said the meeting was first arranged in our house.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:06.500
And we started to run up all the clauses and back to the solicitor.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:12.500
And then we sent to Liverpool for their consideration.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.500
Okay we are starting now.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:21.500
How do you think Durga Puja and festival has evolved over the period?

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:31.500
As you know a lot of people come from UK and other parts of the country like Middle East and others.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:38.500
They didn't have much place to go there and offer their offerings to God.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:46.500
And this is the place they find apart from London, Liverpool, Glasgow they are too far from them.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:54.500
So they came with their own mind that after all God will bless me if I attend.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:03.500
And if I get some Sandy waters then it will bring me prosperity in my life.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.500
And that is evolved.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.500
And everybody some friends have gone there and attended the puja.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.500
They liked it very much. They attended Pushpanjali. They attended prasad.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.500
And met so many people, introduced themselves.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:26.500
And they go back to their place and talk to other friends.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.500
Have you seen all this? Yes. We will also go with you.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.500
This is the way it evolved.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:42.500
So what do you think brought the group together and were able to hold together now?

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.500
Like how it's been able to sustain till now?

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:55.500
Because the group has developed a confidence and strength in their mind.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.500
That after all the God is there and God will bring us together.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.500
This is the main thing.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:11.500
Not that so many people coming introducing ourselves and making friends and go up.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:18.500
It's not that. It is not seeing the prathima and the image of the prathima.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:26.500
And all the paraphernalia of the offering and anjuli and then home.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:33.500
Then the fire after the puja and putting fire on the head.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:42.500
These all these things evolved and joined together harmoniously rather than anything else.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.500
No criticize to each other. No nothing.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:50.500
This is the main thing. And after that whatever you think.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:57.500
Would you like to comment anything about the overall feeling about the festival?

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:04.500
My feeling is that the puja will prosper. You cannot stop. I cannot stop.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:12.500
It is God who will pull the head and doing everything in their own way.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:18.500
So that the people come and give their offerings to them.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.500
And she or he will bless us.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:34.500
That is she is there on the heaven and the couple one day in a ostomy.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.500
And they look at each other what we are doing.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:46.500
That is the conception people come and offering their medications and everything.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.500
And that is the way people are coming and coming.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:18:01.500
And also you can see the other part of this cultural side.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.500
Lot of people like songs. Lot of people like dance.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.500
Lot of people like chandalika and all these things.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:15.500
They never seen. They said oh in UK I can see. What a great pleasure.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.500
That is the Rabindra Sumi. And not only that.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:25.500
The puja brings all the big artists from different parts of Calcutta or any other parts.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.500
And they hear their songs. They enjoy themselves.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.500
And that is the cultural side of it.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.500
And not least good food.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.500
Good food. Good food.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.500
Good food to morning and lunch time and night.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.500
That is a great enjoyment.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.500
And all are ready made and hot.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.500
They say oh lovely food we are getting.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.500
That is also attraction. That's it.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.500
Are there any other things which you would like to share?

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.500
Yes. Do you want to come back again on it?

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:11.500
So would you like to comment anything else on your overall feelings about the festival within Cardiff?

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:18.500
Yes. I think as I said before you know the first part of how we struggled.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.500
But gradually when we had a lot of members came in.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.500
Youngster got interested.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.500
Then the committee was formed.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.500
Everybody got there.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.500
Took their responsibility doing the framework.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.500
But then one person had to do a lot of things.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.500
So the variety program was nice.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.500
We had a catering officer who looked after the food things.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:46.500
And doing that obviously is a group activity not individual.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.500
So everybody worked very hard.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.500
I wouldn't say anything on that.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.500
Gradually, gradually it's sort of homership.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:01.500
The main thing we kept it one thing that we'll do the puja as we have done.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.500
The religious part should be kept.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.500
It wasn't changed.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.500
The religious part was done the same.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:14.500
But we added doing the cultural program and encouraging the children to take the part.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:19.500
They also took the responsibility and decorations and all.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.500
Different activity.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.500
They were more interested to take part.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.500
Otherwise they would have been bored.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.500
So those are things gradually, gradually.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.500
People thought how to improve the committee's activity.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.500
Took part in it.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.500
So the youngster came up.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.500
So the older people also took a little bit of the backside.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.500
But they were there to give the advice.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.500
Our collection in the hall came up.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.500
Money came up.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.500
It's nice to see that committee is getting stronger.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.500
People are more interested outside of Cardiff.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:02.500
I think in Cardiff, people outside of Cardiff when we see the picture in computer.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.500
People phoned from London.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.500
We saw you in the puja.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.500
That's nice to know it's coming up.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.500
And all this.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.500
At that time we think that the Peeve family worked very hard beginning.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.500
That's why we kept the puja going.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.500
It's now rewarding to see the younger generation is following.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.500
Keeping our tradition.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.500
And I hope at least they won't forget about the puja part.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.500
As much as they can.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.500
I know you have to time to time.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.500
With the time you might have to change something.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.500
Perhaps the exact time we can't do.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.500
But as long as we can keep some of the part right.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.500
Then I think people won't lose their interest.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.500
That's the main part of the younger generation now.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.500
To keep it together.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.500
Not to have a division anymore.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.500
What I find myself.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.500
That I always used to tell.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.500
That to be a good committee member.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.500
That you always must think.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.500
That we must agree.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.500
To be.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.500
Not to have a disagreement.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.500
If we agree on that point.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.500
Everybody won't have to be agreeing on all points.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.500
But we have a right to disagree.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.500
Some of the points.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.500
I think we should contribute our comment on that.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.500
Keeping in mind.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.500
That we are all doing voluntary jobs.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.500
It's not a paid job.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.500
So we shouldn't bring any conflict in ourselves.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.500
Whenever we are there.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.500
In the puja committee meeting.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.500
Everybody giving their time free.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.500
Everybody thinking about the puja.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.500
Nobody is paid.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.500
It's not a paid worker.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.500
So nobody blames to everybody.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.500
If somebody's fight is wrong.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.500
Very politely they say.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.500
I would do like that.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.500
Not commenting, criticizing.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.500
And backbiting.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.500
I think that is now we have to think.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.500
That if we want to keep up going on.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.500
Next 20 years.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.500
To what we have done before.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.500
We should learn from our mistakes.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.500
I know we haven't done all correct things.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.500
We have learned from our mistakes.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.500
Every year to year.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.500
How to improve the thing.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.500
How to get the sweet.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.500
How to cut the cost cutting thing.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.500
We started saving money.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.500
Previously we used to pay the money for the caterer.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.500
But a lot of money.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.500
Then the member thought how to collect the money.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.500
So this sort of thing came up.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.500
And now the people are thinking.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.500
They are thinking how to improve.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.500
The youngsters are doing the same thing.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.500
Now the computer age has come.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.500
It's much easier.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.500
Previously we used to pay a lot of phone charges.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.500
Phone call.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.500
We invited people to our own phone call.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.500
So we also paid a lot of money from our own.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.500
But we didn't think about that.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.500
We thought we were doing something.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.500
For our own enjoyment.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.500
And that is I think kept us going on.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.500
Which we I think there were some good days and bad days.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.500
But well at the end you know.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.500
To see Madhurga still in Cardiff.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.500
And now new images being formed.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.500
New image coming up.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.500
Durga Pratima being built.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.500
And the Cardiff all the children.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.500
This country's children also know.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.500
You were all in the same place.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.500
And you were all in the same place.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.500
And the children also know.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.500
You were all working very hard for the school project.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.500
It's nice to see.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.500
I'm sorry we are getting older.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.500
Obviously we can't help physically.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.500
Be there.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.500
But I think we have done our share.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.500
And I think we should leave it to the younger people.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.500
And I always salute.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.500
And I always respect what they are doing.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.500
Because we can't do now much.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.500
So we shouldn't criticize.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.500
But at least we can say time to time.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.500
Whatever we feel better.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.500
Not as advice.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.500
I suggest wise.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.500
That if you feel it will be nice.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.500
Or if I see something going wrong.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.500
I can politely say that.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.500
That liberty should be.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.500
That should be given to the older generation.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.500
I mean younger people think that.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.500
Oh the older they are gone.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.500
We won't take their advice.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.500
That shouldn't be.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.500
That will be for the younger generation part.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.500
That the older generation are there.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.500
If they need some advice they are there to give it.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.500
Because their experience is important.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.500
Whoever may be.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.500
Whoever worked very hard.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.500
I know Mrs. Haldar.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.500
Mrs. Choudhury.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.500
Number 5 and number 11.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.500
What did you say?

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.500
Mrs. Haldar and Mrs. Choudhury.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.500
They are the people who were there in the beginning.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.500
They also worked quite hard with us.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.500
So I am sure they will be.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.500
So all the members who are not there.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.500
Dr. Acharjit.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.500
Dr. Acharjit.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.500
Mrs. Acharya.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.500
Acharya Boudi.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.500
Banerjee. Banerjee Boudi.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.500
All the members who were really in the beginning.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.500
They were quite hard.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.500
Pooja, Sait and Advice and Working.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.500
And Dr. Shingupta passed away.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.500
Who else now our friend.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.500
I think we will mention after.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.500
Dr. Shingupta.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.500
He was our member.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.500
So he worked and he passed away.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.500
So all the members who were there.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.500
Dr. Ganguly was the beginning.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.500
And the member.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.500
Not long he stayed actively.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.500
But he was also the founder member.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.500
One of the.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.500
Mr. Siendars. They were all not actively.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.500
But in the beginning they all passed away.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.500
So we always

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.500
remember them.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.500
And whoever did it. Little bit of contribution.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.500
I think we should remember.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.500
I think we all are human beings.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.500
Obviously we will have a different opinion.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.500
Everything.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.500
But at least we will try.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.500
I think we should pray to God.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.500
Pray to God that everybody.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.500
Bengali group.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.500
Not only Bengali group.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.500
All Indian group here.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.500
They will sort of share their views.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.500
And work together. That is the only thing.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.500
That's the way to prosper.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.500
Whatever we are doing.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.500
And we are doing very well.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.500
So I hope we haven't got any

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.500
complaints on that.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.500
I hope we will stay few years more to enjoy

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.500
your festivities.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.500
And the things you do.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.500
That's all I think.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.500
Thank you.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.500
Would you like to share something else please?

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.500
That I would say at the end.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.500
Number 11.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.500
Anything else you would like to talk about.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.500
Number five.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.500
What major

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.500
challenges you faced.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.500
While arranging

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.500
or organizing puja.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.500
See.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.500
These challenges.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.500
Are really very controversial.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.500
As we are

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.500
very old.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.500
And afraid.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.500
And we can't do physically.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.500
Lot of work.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.500
For the puja. Which we did before.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.500
Lot of challenges.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.500
And criticism come.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.500
And.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.500
To say a few words.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.500
What challenges are coming.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.500
Major challenges those who are religious.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.500
And Brahmin.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.500
And doing puja.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.500
They are telling.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.500
Why you allow the widowed

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.500
person to do bhoga.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.500
Widow.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.500
That's not our

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.500
sastra.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.500
That's not our sastra written.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.500
That they will go. I said look.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.500
Don't criticize this thing.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.500
We are very short of people.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.500
We can't get any people.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.500
And she is religious.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.500
She comes and does these things.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.500
So forget about it.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.500
No we can't forget these things.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.500
Second thing is this.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.500
Again they said.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.500
That they are widowed.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.500
Why you allow in the present.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.500
To touch the.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.500
The all you list.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.500
Ingredients and all the.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.500
Pots and everything.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.500
I said there they came.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.500
They offered their offerings.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.500
So the religious

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.500
people also forget about this.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.500
With a mature and intelligent

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.500
judgment.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.500
You will have to proceed.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.500
And console them.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.500
That forget these things.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.500
These are.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.500
As long

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.500
as all are.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.500
Offering our puja in the same

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.500
manner. So let them

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.500
do it. They are also human

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.500
being. Unfortunately

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.500
they are widowed.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.500
So you can't send them. You can't

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.500
do it. You just.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.500
Put a white shawl with a black

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.500
border and side

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.500
one side. Don't touch

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.500
any matrimonial

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.500
affair. Don't touch it.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.500
Because this is auspicious.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.500
The word auspicious

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.500
doesn't come here. So forget

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.500
this thing. These are

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.500
the preliminary challenge.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.500
We always listen.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.500
And console them.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.500
In a proper way. So

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.500
that we could work together.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.500
In a harmonious way.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.500
And sustain these

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.500
things. So that we can continue

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.500
for long long time.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.500
And now the

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.500
11.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.500
Anything else you would like to talk about?

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.500
Well

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.500
as Krishna you always

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.500
you mentioned about the venue.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.500
Venue we

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.500
talk time and again.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.500
Some people are willing to

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.500
give

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.500
quite a bit

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.500
of fund to buy

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.500
land. But land

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.500
is not the only answer.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.500
You will have to prepare the whole

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.500
building.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.500
Then comes it.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.500
And there building is

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.500
done. Then electricity.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.500
Then rate.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.500
Then the priest

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.500
who will where he will stay.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.500
These are all these

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.500
things comes in.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.500
And it is a very difficult task.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.500
As we see

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.500
in Indian culture there is a priest.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.500
And they have been permanent.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.500
They are. So

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.500
all these things are very difficult.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.500
As Sudeep says

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.500
the puja

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.500
is now

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.500
to be making.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.500
So the priest come from

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.500
India. They got to

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.500
think where they will stay.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.500
Where they will eat.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.500
Where they will. They apart from

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.500
their journey from going

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.500
from Calcutta to UK

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.500
UK to Calcutta back.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.500
All these things.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.500
Suppose they are ill. Who will

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.500
stand together

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.500
and do all these things.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.500
You got to think lot of things.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.500
So we love to

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.500
have some our own venue.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.500
So we can say that

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.500
well Pujya Comte has this venue.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.500
We never had to think

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.500
separate kitchen.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.500
Separate

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.500
venue for the

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.500
for the home.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.500
Another kitchen. And the

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.500
long waiting room.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.500
And stage where the

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.500
cultural function will be held.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.500
Dressing changing room from

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.500
one actor to the other actor.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.500
So many things.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.500
So it is not very easy.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.500
Okay.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.500
I am Sandeep

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.500
Raha from

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.500
Welsh Pujya Committee.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.500
I am the chair of Welsh Pujya Committee at present.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.500
I am at Kamal

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.500
and Sikthabodi's house in Cardiff.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.500
Mr. Kamal Ghatok.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.500
Mr. Ghatok

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.500
I heard

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.500
and know that you were the first

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.500
few people starting

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.500
Durga Puja in Cardiff.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.500
Can you

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.500
tell us how and when

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.500
you got involved in the festival

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.500
in Durga Puja?

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.500
Okay.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.500
Bengali?

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.500
This was not Durga Puja

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.500
before.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.500
This was

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.500
before.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.500
What do you say?

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.500
Your Bija Daswami.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.500
I had a friend

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.500
and flatmate.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.500
Sumbudas.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.500
He said

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.500
that it was not

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.500
useful to do all this.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.500
Do Bija Daswami.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.500
Do Bija Daswami.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.500
It will be good.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.500
He fixed the house.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.500
Mr. Muniram

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.500
helped us a lot.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.500
Then

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.500
our

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.500
Bija Daswami

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.500
started

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.500
Durga Puja.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.500
First

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.500
from Cardiff

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.500
from London

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.500
from Kolkata

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.500
we did Pata Puja.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.500
Then

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.500
I was challenged

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.500
to be a Thakur.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.500
I had been

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.500
a Thakur in many places.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.500
I had

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.500
a Saraswati

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.500
Kaliba

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.500
Durga Puja.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.500
I had all.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.500
You had

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.500
a Durga Puja

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.500
in your garage.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.500
You had five Pujas.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.500
Madhugga,

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.500
Lokhi, Saraswati,

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.500
Kartik and Ganesh.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.500
Tell us

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.500
how you did it.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.500
How did you do it?

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.500
How did you work?

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.500
How did you spend time?

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.500
I came from the office

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.500
and started working.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.500
I had a chillblend.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.500
I went to the

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.500
cold water and

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.500
had a chillblend.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.500
That didn't go away.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.500
Now I have a chillblend

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.500
after I had a chillblend.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.500
The Thakur you made

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.500
was made of

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.500
mud, mud,

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.500
earth, mud,

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.500
and you had done it yourself?

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.500
Yes.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.500
I did it

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.500
with modeling clay.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.500
I used that modeling clay

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.500
and did it with Thakur.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.500
Is it all in the film?

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.500
I will show you the film.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.500
Do you remember your year?

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.500
Which year?

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.500
1978

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.500
or 1979

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.500
No, no, no.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.500
It was

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.500
in 1982

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.500
when it started.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.500
After 1982

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.500
I started

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.500
making clay.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.500
Ok.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.500
So in 1982

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.500
I was 3-4 years old.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.500
When did you start?

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.500
In 1984, 1985, 1986.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.500
Ok.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.500
Ok.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.500
Ok.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.500
As far as I remember

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.500
I saw your

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.500
Pujo in the

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.500
Cardiff Parade.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.500
I saw it.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.500
I think it was something like

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.500
1988-89.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.500
I saw it.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.500
I was in Cardiff but

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.500
Pujo was in Cardiff.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.500
Can you tell who were

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.500
the people at that time with you?

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.500
Who were the people with you

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.500
at that time?

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.500
One was Dr. Ravi Sarkar.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.500
He was

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.500
Banwadi De

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.500
Dr. Asarjo De

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.500
Dr. Asarjo

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.500
He helped us a lot

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.500
during Pujo.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.500
What about

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.500
Rama Chaudhary was there?

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.500
Rama Chaudhary was there.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.500
Ok.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.500
Later when I left him

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.500
Ok.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.500
Rama Chaudhary took

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.500
Bishudaya.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.500
Rama Chaudhary

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.500
Pujo was

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.500
not a part of Rama Chaudhary.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.500
He was involved in

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.500
cultural programs.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.500
He was involved in Pujo

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.500
and some other things.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.500
So, in the first 3-4 years

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.500
who were you worshiping?

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.500
Dr. Asarjo.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.500
Ok.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.500
Then Banarjit came.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.500
He was also a part of

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.500
Parade.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.500
He was a part of

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.500
Pujo.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.500
He was a part of

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.500
Parade.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.500
Where did you worship before Parade?

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.500
Before Parade

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.500
Dr. Sen

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.500
was worshiped

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.500
once at Sen's house.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.500
Once a year.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.500
Ok.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.500
Then

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.500
I took him to Parade.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.500
Yes.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.500
I was worshiping at Parade.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.500
It was a very successful worship.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.500
It was a year.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.500
Then at the Pujo

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.500
you can say it as a teacher

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.500
then how did you arrange

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.500
food at the Pujo?

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.500
Food

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.500
was in the kitchen.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.500
I cooked once at Parade

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.500
I remember.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.500
Kichdi, Kiki.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.500
All the boys did it.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.500
The girls couldn't do it properly.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.500
There was nothing at the bottom of the Parade.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.500
In the basement.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.500
And the brother-in-law

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.500
Dr. Asarjo made sweets.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.500
And

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.500
then you

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.500
where did you write the Pujo

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.500
document?

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.500
Yes.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.500
It was

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.500
Papu

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.500
Debasish

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.500
Naelgi.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.500
That was the Kali Pujo.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.500
In Kali Pujo?

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.500
The Pujo

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.500
was in the basement.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.500
You brought the fruits from the basement?

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.500
Flowers, fruits,

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.500
from where?

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.500
From the basement.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.500
I brought the fruits

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.500
from the basement.

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.500
And what else?

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.500
Pujo

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.500
Dinesh Patra.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.500
Was there anything

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.500
related to the Basant Patra?

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.500
There was something related to the Basant Patra.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.500
Then we gave something.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.500
Then it all happened.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.500
And where did the Pujo money go?

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.500
The money for the Moon?

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.500
The expenses?

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.500
I had

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.500
the Parade

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.500
where no Pujo was allowed to walk.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.500
I see.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.500
I started

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.500
with Hindu culture.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.500
So I thought

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.500
what will happen?

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.500
I said, I will pay.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.500
I will pay

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.500
but

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.500
the Moon will not be there.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.500
You see,

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.500
during the Pujo

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.500
the Moon

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.500
was very

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.500
difficult to get.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.500
Was the Moon

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.500
collected from the house?

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.500
No.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.500
It was not collected from the house.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.500
It was given

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.500
to whoever gave it.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.500
And

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.500
as much as you

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.500
remember,

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.500
do you remember

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.500
any specific event

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.500
during the Durga Pujo

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.500
that stuck in your mind?

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.500
Can you tell us?

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.500
I remember

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.500
one thing

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.500
that I found very bad.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.500
When I made the Pujo

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.500
there was a group

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.500
there was a group

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.500
of people

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.500
who said

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.500
that they don't want the Pujo

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.500
but they want the Saraswati Pujo

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.500
I want the Durga Pujo

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.500
but I don't want the Pujo.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.500
That is what I remember.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.500
There is a story.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.500
There is a story.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.500
So I don't

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.500
go to the Pujo

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.500
I don't go to the Pujo in Kashmir.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.500
That is what

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.500
I remember.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.500
That is what I remember.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.500
You were in

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.500
Pratima Bani. You made the image

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.500
and that image was

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.500
worshipped by West Pujo Committee.

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.500
West Pujo Committee was not there then.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.500
The name was different.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.500
I know that.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.500
That was worshipped for nearly

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.500
6-7 years.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.500
After that

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.500
when the first Pratima came

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.500
do you know

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.500
about it when the first Pratima

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.500
came from Kolkata or Kumartudi?

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.500
Do you remember?

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.500
First

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.500
that

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.500
that

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.500
Pujo was worshipped here.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.500
Then Thakur came.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.500
Then I made my Thakur.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.500
Then

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.500
Thakur came from

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.500
the country.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.500
Thakur came from the country.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.500
Then

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.500
he gave

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.500
my Thakur to Vishwajan.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.500
So that

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.500
was the issue.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.500
Your Thakur was Vishwajan's issue.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.500
Yes. He gave my Thakur to Vishwajan.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.500
He didn't ask me.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.500
He didn't ask you?

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.500
No.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.500
He didn't ask me anything.

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.500
Okay.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.500
This is the

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.500
secret of the secret.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.500
What happened?

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.500
You don't know.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.500
What happened?

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.500
No. I am saying that

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.500
your Thakur Vishwajan

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.500
the Thakur you made

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.500
the five Pratimas

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.500
the five Pratimas

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.500
actually happened

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.500
in your

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.500
in your

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.500
1991 or 1992

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.500
after our first Pratima came.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.500
After our first Pratima came.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.500
The first Pratima came in 1990

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.500
from Kumartoli.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.500
After the first Pratima came

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.500
the Welsh Pujo committee gave the Pratima

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.500
to your Pratima

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.500
in 1992 or 1993.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.500
I don't know exactly.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.500
But you don't know

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.500
that your Pratima is in Vishwajan?

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.500
No. I don't know.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.500
Nobody told me.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.500
That is in my mind.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.500
There is a

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.500
mystery.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.500
What do you say?

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.500
Here you go.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.500
All my documents

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.500
are here.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.500
Okay. You have your documents.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.500
I will see.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.500
I will see.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.500
You see.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.500
No, no, no.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.500
I will see.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.500
I will see the pictures.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.500
It will look very good.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.500
Tell me.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.500
Who are you talking about?

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.500
Who was the Pujo then?

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.500
And you don't know

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.500
about the Pujo now.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.500
I don't know about the Pujo.

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.500
I am saying that

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.500
what is the difference between

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.500
the Pujo and the Hindu Pujo?

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.500
What is the difference?

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.500
Tell me about the other Pujo.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.500
I know that Kamal Da

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.500
you have

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.500
been involved in the Hindu

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.500
Cultural Association

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.500
which is a temple

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.500
in Kadip.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.500
You were involved in the Pujo.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.500
For the first few years.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.500
Tell me about that.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.500
How did you get involved?

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.500
How did you get involved?

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.500
I will show you.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.500
Hindu Culture.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.500
Tell me about that.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.500
That was

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.500
a challenge.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.500
Tell me about that challenge.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.500
The challenge was

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.500
before I came here

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.500
I started the Pujo

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.500
in Leeds.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.500
I started the Pujo in Leeds.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.500
The

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.500
seat.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.500
The cardiff.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.500
You started the Pujo

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.500
in Leeds

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.500
before the cardiff?

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.500
Before the cardiff.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.500
Before 1974.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.500
I am saying

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.500
that you have been involved in the Hindu

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.500
Cultural Association for 2-3 years.

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.500
You have been involved in the Hindu

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.500
Cultural Association for 2-3 years.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.500
In India Centre.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.500
Tell me about that.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.500
What is your experience?

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.500
That is

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.500
the attempt.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.500
That was your

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.500
attempt.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.500
I have been involved in

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.500
the Hindu Cultural Association

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.500
in London.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.500
I have fought with them.

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.500
That was my experience.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.500
I don't know

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.500
anything about Pujo.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.500
I have written about it.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.500
The first time

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.500
the Pujo started in

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.500
the Centre.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.500
Did someone else come from

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.500
London?

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.500
That was the

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.500
Pujo.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.500
Not that.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.500
One more.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.500
One minute.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.500
Kamal, you said

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.500
that the first

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.500
canvas, pot

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.500
was the picture.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.500
Can you tell a bit more about

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.500
that canvas?

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.500
How did it arrive in

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.500
Cardiff?

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.500
Last year

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.500
Aasajada Pujo

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.500
started.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.500
Parade.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.500
That canvas

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.500
I went to Aasajada's house.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:50.500
I asked

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.500
who else came and everyone said

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.500
me. There were two people.

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.500
There were two people

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.500
and I knew some people.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.500
I told Aasajada

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.500
to worship you.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.500
I forgot all that.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.500
So, your

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.500
pot

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.500
picture, the canvas

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.500
was made in London

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.500
or was it from India?

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.500
It was from India.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.500
It was from India.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.500
Did Mr. Sarkar

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.500
do the research?

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.500
No.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.500
Sarkar did the research.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.500
Many people came after him.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.500
So, that painting

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.500
was made in Pujo

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.500
to be your portrait.

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.500
Your portrait was replaced.

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.500
Yes, it was replaced.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.500
So, the portrait you made

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.500
where did you get the information

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.500
about clay and these?

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.500
The clay you used...

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.500
Listen.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.500
I

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.500
went to Kolkata.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.500
In Kumatoli

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.500
for a few days

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.500
I stayed

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.500
with him.

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.500
By the way

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.500
Did you get training?

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.500
I got training.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.500
This is a new news.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.500
From him

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.500
I went to Kolkata.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.500
In Kumatoli.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.500
It was difficult to sell one piece.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.500
It was difficult.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.500
I had to pay

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.500
for it.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.500
So, I stayed

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.500
with him

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.500
for a year

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.500
or a month.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.500
Did you do it during

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.500
your holiday time?

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.500
No.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.500
I was on leave from office.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.500
I was on leave for a year.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.500
It was not a second.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.500
So, I went to India.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.500
I went to India.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.500
I went to Kumatoli.

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.500
I stayed there for a month.

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.500
Then I saw how they made it.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.500
How they made it.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.500
I learned

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.500
the things I had learned.

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.500
Then

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.500
I brought

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.500
the cloths.

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.500
Now it is in my garage.

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.500
It is in my house.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.500
There are

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.500
grass and flowers.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.500
Then I brought the cloths.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.500
The cloths.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.500
The cloths.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.500
The cloths.

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.500
They broke.

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.500
Or they

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.500
prayed.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.500
They did this.

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.500
They were not ready.

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.500
But I saw

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.500
the cloths

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.500
and bought them.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.500
The cloths

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.500
and the grass.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.500
It was difficult to get the grass.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.500
It was very difficult

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.500
to get the grass.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.500
I brought the

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.500
cloths and the grass.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.500
I took rest.

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.500
Actually

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.500
I was

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.500
on leave.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.500
I had

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.500
a plan.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.500
I made a cloth.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.500
I made a cloth.

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.500
I made a cloth.

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.500
I will make a cloth.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.500
I will do

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.500
whatever I can.

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.500
I did that.

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.500
In the garage.

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.500
In the garage.

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.500
In the garage.

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:04.500
In the garage.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.500
I did that.

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.500
You did it yesterday.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.500
I did it yesterday.

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.500
That month.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.500
Your

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.500
Mohananda Maharaj

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.500
His disciple

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.500
in Kabindy

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.500
He did

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.500
this.

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.500
He said Kamal, you do this.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.500
Let me do this.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.500
Let me do this.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.500
Why?

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.500
He said

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.500
that my devotee

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.500
will do

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.500
this.

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.500
He said

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.500
that I have no fault in making a cloth.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.500
I have no fault.

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.500
I have no fault.

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.500
I will understand.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.500
You will make the cloth.

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.500
The fault is mine.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.500
The fault is mine.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.500
Then I made the cloth.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.500
Did it take time

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.500
to make the cloth?

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.500
Did it take time?

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.500
Did it take time?

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:14.500
Did it take time?

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.500
Did it take time?

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.500
Then in London,

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.500
in Kalibati,

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.500
I brought the cloth

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.500
and made the cloth.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.500
I gave 25 paise.

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.500
I gave 25 paise.

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.500
I don't know

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.500
where it went.

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.500
The Kalithakur

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:36.500
that you made

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.500
was in Coventry.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.500
It was in Midlands.

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.500
The Kalithakur.

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.500
There was one Kalithakur

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.500
that

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.500
we worshiped.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.500
And that

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.500
Kalithakur

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.500
was made

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.500
by you.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.500
Because we

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.500
had won the Kalithakur in Kolkata.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.500
Before that

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.500
there was another Kalithakur

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.500
that was in Karda's house.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.500
That Kalithakur was made by you.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.500
Because no one else can make Kalithakur in Cardiff.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.500
I was the first

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.500
to make it

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.500
with soil

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.500
in my own hands.

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:20.500
In your own hands.

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.500
In my own hands.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.500
And what else?

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.500
I made a sieve.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.500
The sieve came to Karda's house.

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.500
In Karda's house

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.500
the sieve

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:34.500
was made by the Hindu

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.500
and the Hindu worshipers.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.500
So I made a sieve.

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.500
I have done many things

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.500
but I don't feel sad.

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.500
Those

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.500
things

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.500
have

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.500
been in my mind

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.500
that I want Thakur

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.500
but not Kamal Ghat.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.500
I don't want it.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.500
I don't want it.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.500
I don't want it.

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.500
Okay.

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.500
You

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.500
in this ancient Durga Puja

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.500
Wales

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:16.500
what was happening then

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.500
and what is happening now

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.500
I know you don't know about the Puja.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:22.500
In this ancient subject

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.500
do you have any words?

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.500
In my ancient subject

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.500
I missed Samudas

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.500
Samudas

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.500
he is my

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.500
I left him

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.500
for gambling

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.500
I left him for gambling

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.500
You had a roommate

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.500
right?

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.500
Yes. I had a roommate

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.500
and he went to Swan Seat

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.500
he ran away from me.

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.500
So there

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:52.500
there

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.500
he saw an ambulance

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.500
ambulance

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.500
ambulance

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.500
he got up

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.500
he got up

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.500
and he was killed

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.500
Yes.

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.500
So

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.500
Samudas

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.500
did nothing.

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.500
But after Samudas

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.500
after he died you were in Puja

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.500
many days.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.500
You were in Puja many days.

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.500
Yes.

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.500
But after Samudas

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.500
I went to his house

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.500
I showed it to his parents

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.500
I showed it to his brother

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.500
his brother was the head of the

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.500
metal arts department

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.500
head of the movement

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.500
I went

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:44.500
to his house

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.500
then

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.500
this

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.500
Nandhi

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.500
what does he do on television?

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.500
Which Nandhi?

00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.500
Not Nandhi

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.500
Palith

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.500
Nick Palith

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.500
Nick Palith

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.500
Nick Palith is

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:10.500
Jennifer

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.500
and

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.500
Srirang Sripalith's son

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.500
Yes.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.500
Srirang Sripalith was

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:20.500
with you at first, right?

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.500
Yes. Srirang Sripalith was

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.500
I showed him from his house

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.500
I showed him from his house

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.500
then

00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.500
Srirang Sripalith

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.500
There were some more

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.500
who were with you at first

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.500
in Puja

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.500
Srirang Sripalith was

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.500
Anandamistra

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.500
and Ashi Thaldar was

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.500
Hey Vishwa

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.500
Ashi Thaldar

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.500
was not

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.500
Ashi Thaldar came later

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.500
came later

00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:58.500
and Mr. Kaur was

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.500
Kaur was

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.500
Purobori

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.500
and

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.500

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.500
were not there at first

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.500
No, they were not there at first

00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.500
came later

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.500
Ok

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.500
Ok Kamal da

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.500
Thank you very much

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.500
You gave us a lot of information

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.500
and reminded us of many

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:28.500
old stories

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:30.500
We got many new pictures
