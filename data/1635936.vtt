00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
My name is Donald Davis. I was born in Kings Road in Llanderby on the 5th of the 4th of 1932.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I went to school in the Infant School, which is the oldest school in Llanderby.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And then when I became old enough I went to the Central School and stayed there until I was 14 years of age.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I don't remember really of the actual starting of the war, but we lived in Kings Road.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And after a number of years of the war Swansea was being bombed by the Germans.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And we could see from our home in Kings Road the glow of the oil works in Llandarcy, which was well alight at that time.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And the south part of it we could hear the bombings of Swansea itself and the sounds then of the Heinkel bombers, which had a humming noise.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And it was like this, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, which sounded like as if they were driven by diesel engines.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm not quite sure whether they were diesel or petrol, I'm not quite sure.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But Swansea was really well alight and as far as we were concerned in Kings Road we could very well have been able to read a newspaper.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Because of the light the Llandarcy oil works gave off being well alight.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The work itself in Swansea, later on after the bombings we went down to Swansea and we could see all the rubble which was strewn everywhere.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And I think bulldozers must have been going along to clear a way through the rubble.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And that was to us, it was just being well only about 12 years of age then.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But during that time it was an exciting outing basically.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But only we weren't old enough to realise what really was going on.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:25.000
During the war, as far as my father was friendly with a gentleman called Mr. Harro Lee who lived in Llandaerlore Road in Llandebier.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And he had to go to Morrison Hospital to get medical attention.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And next to him in bed was a German, either a pilot or a member of an aircrew or what he was, I'm not quite sure.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:59.000
But he must have been able to speak English because Harro Lee asked him how did he manage to bomb Swansea so accurately.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And he said that it was comparatively easy for them.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
All they had to do was to fly over Llandebier.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And there is, well there was during that time, a furnace in the lime firms in Llandebier.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And that was well alight at night and it had the glow you could see for miles, not only from up but even in the village it was quite alight.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So what the gentleman in the hospital said to Harro Lee was that he flew over Llandebier, found that furnace well alight.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:25.000
On a nice clear evening he was able to pick out the railway lines that he knew about possibly leading towards Swansea.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:39.000
All they had to do was to follow the sheen on the railway tracks themselves, the lines, and follow it all the way down to Swansea.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And then they bombed the city itself.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And then I remember them seem to be coming back the same way and then turning as they got to Llandebier, they seem to be turning towards Carmarthen over a place called Broad Oak.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And we were told later on that the air crew must have either had too many bombs left so they let go five bombs over towards the Broad Oak area.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I've never heard anything of that, whether that was true or not, but I've never heard any stories from that date this regarding the bombs creating any damage or anything over towards Broad Oak.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Now during the time that Mr. Lee was in hospital, he obviously gathered all this information and when he returned home he reported the whole matter to the police.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And within a couple of weeks after the whole furnace was covered over with a big steel canopy like the head of a mushroom which hit the whole glow of the furnace itself.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
So that was well done Mr. Lee.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:48.000
As was expected, the traffic on the railway line during the war was quite heavily occupied by trains going up and down the line.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And we as children, we were quite interested in the tanks and armaments that were going up, but I never saw them coming down again towards Shrewsbury or Llandaillot and Shrewsbury area.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But then later on, quite often these American soldiers were being transported past the railway station in Landerby.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So being her children, we were quite interested in American chewing gum. So we all as boys together, we all stood on the railway gates and shouted, any gum chap.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And we could see as the train went by, the packets of chewing gum, Wrigley's chewing gum was being thrown out.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:10.000
So as soon as the train passed, we were like little rabbits running around the place looking for the bits of packets of chewing gum.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And that was the start of basically us thinking of the American soldiers being in the area.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:34.000
From time to time then, in the village, there was a dance in the memorial hall and the American soldiers seemed to be invited there.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And quite nicely, and we could see them enjoying at one time until there was a fight on the square with some of the locals.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And obviously it was a sad day to see everybody fighting on the square near the church.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And this gentleman had been to the chip shop above all things. He had all must be fishing ships.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And as he came from the fishing chip shop, could see this fight and with about, well, it must be eight to ten people fighting on the square.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:39.000
He got entangled with the fight and as far as the chips were concerned, they were all strewn all over the floor right across.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And that was sad to me because, you know, they were coming to help us and you get a few people that were after a couple of pints of beer.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And everybody seemed to be the enemy and they didn't realize it, but this is what happened.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And unfortunately then, after a couple of weeks, my parents invited a couple of American soldiers into Sunnyhurst in Kings Road.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000
My mother was quite a lovely lady really, although I say it myself.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:49.000
During the war then, she always said, I'll have to be kind to people, to soldiers, because when my boys might have to go to the war, I hope somebody will look after them.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And unknowns to her, this is what happened.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And there were Italian prisoners in Landeby.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Germans were in, I think, Llandarog.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And but we had an Italian prisoner in Gambica Farm. His name was Luigi Fontana.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And the police one night on Saturday evening came to see my parents and being Catholics, asked us to take Luigi to the Catholic Church in Ammanford and escort him there and escort him back to our house.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And then he was returned to the farm in Gambica.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And of course, he was a very smart ex-policeman prior to him going to the, being called up in the army.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000
He was a very smart person. He became a prisoner in Tunis.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And his friend, who was another prisoner in Llandeby, his name was Ernesto Masse.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:35.000
He was a tank commander, a sergeant, and they both used to come and stay in our house and just have a cup of tea and somewhere to go.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And my mother was quite entertaining.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
We were all a family together basically.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And one night on a Friday night, just before Christmas, we used to call Ernesto Masse Dino.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
That was, seemed to be his nickname.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And on this Friday night, there was a knock on the back door.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And my mother went to open the door.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And Dino was there with a big brown paper bag.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And he said, present, Mama, present.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And when she looked into the bag, it was, there must have been about 40 or 50 sparrows there, dead sparrows.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So my mother said, take them back, you cruel thing.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I don't want them. Take them back.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And the object of him bringing the sparrows to my mother's house was that being Christmastime in Italy,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000
they set bird cages in the Alps to sing.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
They started singing.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And then unfortunately, other birds came along and bang, bang, bang.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
That's how they trapped them.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And so then they garnish the turkey with sparrows, little bodies basically.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
But my mother was quite shocked.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And do you know how to take them, what he did with the sparrows?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000
We'll never know because ever since he went back to Italy and he went to Australia,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
but I still pray for him every night.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I pray for them all.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Another day in, Dino Ernesto Marseille was coming up the road.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And we were all out on the front.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And he was so excited, coming towards my mother's home and our home,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
that he had this letter in his hand.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
And he said, look, look, Maria, letter from Maria.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Look, look.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And he knew very well that we couldn't understand what was written on the letter

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
because it was all in Italian.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
He said, look, mama, feel it.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
He said, so feel the letter.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And he was so excited.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And later on, after his return, all Italians, they went back.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So my parents and myself went to Milan to visit Dino and his wife Maria.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
They had a son called Gianfranco.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Now that, unfortunately, was the last time I saw him.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And he went back to, as I've already said, he went back to, emigrated, I think, to Australia.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And I think he died there.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And I have tried to trace Gianfranco.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.000
They lived in Via Pizzano Moderno in Milan.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:39.000
But I haven't had any joy getting hold of them at all.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000
But another prisoner was Guido Bonato.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
I went to Padoa with my parents.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
We traced him through our friend Luigi Fontana.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:02.000
He took us there to meet Guido Bonato.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
He was quite a good-looking man and very reserved.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And he introduced us to his wife.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And she was working in a spa center.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And we said hello and goodbye.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And that was the last time I saw Guido Bonato and his wife.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
And they, as I've said, they lived in Verona.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
We heard on the radio that the war was over.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And my mother immediately asked Dennis, my brother, my twin brother, and myself, to run down the village.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Quick, quick, quick, she said.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Go to the vicarage and ask the vicar to ring the church bell.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And tell him to ring it straight away because the war is over.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And so we went down.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And I can see the vicar now.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
He was a big, very big man.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
His name was Mr. Davis, Vicar Davis.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.000
And within, by the time we got home, the bells were ringing.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.000
And that, I think, was the first time they were running after the war.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Because during the war, the bells were not allowed to chime at all.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:59.000
So then everybody started to have the party sort of atmosphere.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
And there was street parties.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And everybody seemed to be so happy.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:16.000
But sadly, the war in Japan hadn't ended during that time.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:26.000
So then, of course, then became, I think, BJ Day, victory in Japan later on.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I'm proud to say that I'm still in contact with the Fontana family.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Fontana being the Italian prisoner, I'm quite proud to say that I'm still in contact with his wife.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Her name is Irene.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
She is now 96 years old.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
She has a daughter, Elsa.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
When we first came out of the Army, my parents and I went to Italy.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Elsa was only about five then.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:18.000
And then she had, Irene had a daughter, another daughter called Elda, a son called Flavio.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:30.000
And now they're all married and they live in the Vicenza area in Italy in a village called Marlo.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Each and every day, every Sunday, I speak to them on WhatsApp.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
And we have a long chat.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
And it's so nice to be able to see them all.
