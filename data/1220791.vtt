00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
My grandfather's factory was absolutely ruined amongst well other people.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
They were evacuated because of the commotion and fear.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I mean they were very frightened.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Winston Churchill, as you probably recall, he sent in the troops and the riot act was read there.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They destroyed the factory.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
My grandmother was pregnant at the time.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This was in July and the baby was due in August.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And Alfred de Rothschild offered them his home for some of the Jewish people who literally lost everything.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And my grandparents went there to Somers State just outside London.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The baby was born, my aunt, and she called him Alfreda after Alfred de Rothschild, which is a very interesting thing.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And then the government made a full inquiry into the Tredegar riots.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They came out on the side of the Jewish people that they had been so badly treated.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I mean the troops were sent here by Winston Churchill, riot act read outside Tredegar County Hall.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And they were all given compensation.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now, being a nosy one, when I was a bit younger, I went to the county archives in Cwmbran to have a look at it all.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And there was a letter from my grandmother in her own hand written acknowledging the payment of compensation in 1913 of Â£800, which is an enormous amount of money.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And all the other Jewish people who had all their businesses literally destroyed were penniless, had substantial compensation.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So out of that evil came a little bit of good.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The government came out against the perpetrators.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
A lot of them were arrested.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
They were given various sentences or various hard letters.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It was quite amazing.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But there was one fly in the ointment.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
There was a gentleman there who was the chief constable by the name of Bozenke.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And he wrote a damning letter to Winston Churchill, which I've actually seen in the archives, which stated that these Jews come from Russia to Tredegar with absolutely nothing.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Within a year or so, they become property owners and all terrifically anti-Semitic.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It was quite astonishing how bitter they were, envious, but they don't realize how hard these people were.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
They came with nothing, yes.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You only have to go to the cemetery in Merthyr Tydfil above Kevon, which is still there,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and you look at the gravestones dated 1870s, 1880s, from all over Europe, how these people came and how they started and how they got on their feet.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's a quite incredible story.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And it was only because they worked hard.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I mean, they didn't inherit anything.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It all came from just sheer hard work.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And yet it bounded back in them because there was a story going round that they were forcing the people to go and work in the shops that they owned.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It was the times, there was the Irish strike, there was a lot of strikes going on with the miners and God knows what,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and unfortunately the Jewish people became a scapegoat of it all.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But anyway, it's that sort of thing.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That's what I was even thought of.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Yes, but you have a sort of family memory.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Well, of course, my grandmother never forgot it and my grandparents used to talk about it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I mean, in fact, they lived to death.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You can imagine a mob like they were, and they were rough.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I mean, they weren't Welsh.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
A lot of them were Irish.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You see, the Tredegar Iron and Coal Works at that time was the largest in Europe, employed about 6,000, 7,000 people.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The population of Tredegar, which was a little town, one of the busiest Welsh towns in South Wales,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and it attracted people from Russia who had family over here and they got jobs.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
A lot of them were miners, a lot of them were steelworkers, but they all prospered.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It's quite phenomenal.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And my grandfather was one of 14 children and they all grew up in Tredegar, most of them.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But of course, they all diversified.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
A lot of them went to university, they became professionals.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
The history of the family is quite astonishing, how they got themselves up and how they put themselves forward.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It really is.
