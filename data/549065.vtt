Yn ogystal â ti, Sylvia. Gallwch chi ddweud i mi, eich anffyrdd, adres a deyrnod?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Mae'n enw Sylvia Anne Redden a fy deyrnod yw 5 Febrer ym 1938.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Gallwch chi ddweud i ni am eich ymchwil, lle oeddwch chi'n nifer, ymchwil, ym mhyth oeddwch chi, a'r syblion, a beth yw'n ei wneud?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Roeddwn i'n nifer am ymchwil ym 1938, ac yn y tîm yma, byddem yn ystod ymchwil ym Mhaer,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
ac ym mhaer ymlaen, ym mhaer ym Mhaer.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Gallwn i ddweud ychydig o beth yw hynny. Yn ffaith, roeddwn i am 18 mlynedd oed pan ymchwil yn ymchwil,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
ac gallwn i ddweud ymchwil ym mhyth oedd yn ymchwil ym mhaer ym mhaer.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Roeddwn i'n mynd o'r ymchwil ac roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ysgol ym Mhaer,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
ond roedd fy mhaer ddim yn dda iawn gyda'r ymchwil yma, a oedd yn dda i'n dda i'r ysgol.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ymchwil, ym mhaer ym mhaer ym mhaer ym mhaer,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
ond roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ysgol mwyaf o'r mhaer ym Mhaer,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
ac roeddwn i'n mynd i weithio ysgol.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Rwy'n dechrau, roeddwn i'n dweud,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
yn fwyaf o'r ymchwil yma,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
ym Mhyskin Junior, sydd wedi'i mynd i'r ysgol,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
roeddwn yn cymryd i chi ddweud i chi'n ddechrau,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
yn oed yn dda i chi, oherwydd bod chi'n dda i ddwy oed,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
ac roeddwn yn dda i chi yn y ddwy oed i gyd yn ymwneud â'r atitud i'r ysgol,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
i'r ysgol, i'r ysgol a'r gweithio.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Roedd fy mhaer yn dda i'n gweithio,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
ac yn y tîm, nid oes rhywbeth i'r gwaith i'r gwaith i'r gweithwyr,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
ond i'n gweithio ar gyfer cymorth,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
felly roedd fy mhaer yn dda i'n gweithio,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
ond yn y ddwy oed, roedd hi wedi gweithio yn y munisiynau

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
a'n fynd i fynd i un o'n ffaith,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
gyda ffyrwyd, sy'n dda i'n dda i,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
oherwydd roeddwn yn unig.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Ond roedd y gwaith i'r ysgol wedi'i gael i'r gwaith,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
ac roedd fy mhaer yn y gwaith i'r ffaith y gallwch chi gael i'r gwaith,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
ac roedd nhw wedi'i gael i fyny yn ystraddor ym Mhwyst,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
unrhyw boedd ac ysgol ysgol.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Roedd y bobl ddim yn cael eu gael oherwydd roedd nhw'n siblings hŷn

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
a ddim yn gallu gael ei gael i'r rŵm.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Felly roedd fy mhaer yn cael eu gael i'r gwaith

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
ac roedd hi'n gael ei gwaith yn y munisiynau

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
ac roedd hi'n cael fy mhaer yn ôl i fy marn.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Ond roeddwn i'r gwaith arian ymlaen,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000

oedd ysgol GCCs.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.080
Roedd ysgol drwy'r 3,

Roeddwn ni'n bywyd yn bobl,

ac yn ymwneud i GCCs.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.080
Roeddwn i ddim yn mynd i

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.080
oherwydd gallwch chi ddod gwasanaethau gwasanaethau,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.080
roeddwn yn gyfrannu gwasanaethau,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.080
roeddwn yn dda.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.080
Gallwch chi ddod 4,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.080
gallwch chi ddod 4,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.080
a ganddi 3.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.080
Roeddwn i'n cael ei ddod iawn

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.080
oedd roeddwn i wedi gael

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.080
ei ddod yn ystod ddod,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.080
ac un o'r ddod wedi cael ei ddod i'r ddod.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.080
Ac pan ddod i'r ddod y ddod y ddod,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.080
mae'n gwybod fy mwyaf wedi'i wneud ar y

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.080
ddod yn ystod ddod,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.080
oherwydd, beth y byddwn yn ystod,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.080
mae'n gwybod, pan ddod i'n ystod ddod i ddod.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.080
Felly,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.080
dydw i ddod i ddod oherwydd,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.080
yn ystod, mae'n dda i ddod i ddod.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.080
A roeddwn i oedd o'r ddod,

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.080
a dydw i'n meddwl,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.080
roeddwn i'n meddwl,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.080
y pwyllgor ymlaen amdano chi

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.080
yw'r productau metal AB.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.080
Rwy'n rhoi'r gwybodaeth.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.080
Dwi'n mynd yn ystod y lline, dwi'n mynd yn ystod y lline,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.080
a roedd fy mwyaf yn dweud,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.080
dwi'n mynd yn ystod y lline gyda'ch educau.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.080
Felly, roeddwn i'n mynd i ddod

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.080
ac un o'n ffrind i'n dweud,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.080
roedden nhw'n edrych ar bobl

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.080
ar y seccion ymddysg,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.080
sef gwasanaeth.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.080
Felly, roeddwn i wedi gwneud ysgol

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.080
yn fy nghymdeithas,

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.080
gweithio fel ddod.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.080
Mae'r AB yn harfodd

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.080
ei wneud i chi gael eich cael eu gwaith.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.080
Ond roedd yn fwy o'n fwyaf yn y cwm,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.080
a roedd yn gwneud fel

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.080
bod chi'n fwyaf o'n gorau

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.080
yn y lline,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.080
ac os ydych chi ddim weithio

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.080
o'ch gwaith,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.080
mae'n cael ei ddod arall.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.080
Mae'n cael ei ddod i'n gweithio.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.080
Felly,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.080
roeddwn i'n mynd i'r AB,

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.080
roeddwn i'n gweithio yn ymddysg

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.080
yn y cwm AB Metall,

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.080
felly byddai hynny'n 1959,

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.080
ac roedd yna,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.080
yn ystod 1960,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.080
yn ystod 1960,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.080
yn ystod 1966.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.080
A allwn i ddweud sut ydych

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.080
yn mynd i'r AB Metall?

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.080
Ymddysg.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.080
Rwy'n dweud,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.080
roeddwn yn dweud,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.080
roeddwn yn dweud,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.080
roeddwn yn dweud,

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.080
a'n fwyaf o ffwrdd,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.080
oherwydd byddwn yn ystod...

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.080
Yn ogystal â'r gweithiau,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.080
mae'n fwyaf o bwyth yn ystod

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.080
yn ystod y gweithiau,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.080
a'n fwyaf o ffwrdd,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.080
a'n fwyaf o ffwrdd,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.080
a'n fwyaf o ffwrdd,

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.080
a'n fwyaf o ffwrdd,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080
felly byddwn yn ystod yn ystod

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.080
yn y ffwrdd,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.080
roeddwn yn cael gwybodaeth

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.080
drwy'r gais,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.080
a'n gwybodaeth drwy'r gais,

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:32.080
20 abies beses a'i ddod yn Mountain Ash,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.080
a'i ddod yn yr ymchwil o'r amlwg, i ddod yn ymchwil,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.080
ond i ddod yn y ddod yn y ddod,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.080
byddwch chi'n cael ei ddod yn y brifysgol

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:46.080
a'i ddod yn y lle rydych chi eisiau ei ddod.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.080
Ond yn y tîm, fe ddodd yn Lapis 5,

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.080
felly pan fe ddodd yn y ddod,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.080
nid oes gwybodaeth.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.080
Nid oes 24 o'r awr,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.080
nid oes rhywbeth,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.080
fe ddodd un siop y dydd,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.080
ac fe ddodd yn y ddod.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.080
Felly, roeddwn i'n gwybod,

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.080
a oedd yr ymchwil wedi'i ddod i chi ddod o'r ymchwil yna?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.080
Nid, dydw i'n credu bod chi wedi'i ddod i chi.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.080
Roedd hi'n cael pittans,

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.080
dydw i'n gwybod, nid oes rhan at all.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.080
Mae'r busiau rhan a lles,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.080
roedd hi'n gwybod yn y brifysgol,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.080
ond fe ddodd i chi ddod i.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.080
Mae'n rhan o'r ddod.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.080
Felly, roedd gennych chi'n gwybod i ABs.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.080
Roedd y bobl o ffrindiau ydych chi'n gwybod,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.080
a'r bobl o'r gweithio yno?

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.080
Nid, dydw i ddim gwybod unrhyw un yno.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.080
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ystafell,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.080
sy'n cael un, ddw, ddw,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.080
am 9 gwybodaeth yn gweithio yno.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.080
Roedd yna, ychydig,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.080
yn cael un ystafell yn ystafell.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.080
Ond nid oes gennych chi ystafell yno

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.080
oherwydd y cyfnod yma,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.080
roedd nhw'n cael gwybod y gweithiau,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.080
ei bod yn cael un ystafell o ddodd,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.080
roedd angen gwybodaeth yna.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.080
Felly, roedd gennych chi'n ystafell,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.080
ond roedd hi'n cael ei gwybod i.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.080
Dydw i ddim gwybod unrhyw un yno,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.080
ond roedd yna,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.080
unrhyw un yna yn ystafell a'r brifysgol,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.080
ond roedd gennych chi'n cael unrhyw un yno.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.080
Mae'n rhai ffyrdd yn fwy o'r hyn yma.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.080
Ond roedd gennych chi'n cael eu gwybod,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.080
ac roedd gennych chi'n cael ffrindiau

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.080
yn ystafell yno,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.080
yn y ddau cyntaf yma,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.080
a'r hyn yma.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.080
Rydw i'n meddwl, roedd llawer o'r bobl deall

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.080
a gweithio gyda fi yna,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.080
sydd wedi'i gael gwybod,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.080
a'r hyn yn cael ei gwybod.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.080
A roedd yna,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.080
yn ffordd o bwyd, yw'n gweld,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.080
roedd gennych yn ystafell,

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.080
yn bwysig.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.080
Roedd gennych ddysgu'ch lles,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.080
a'n gweithio'n gweithio'ch gweithio,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.080
ond roedd y man sy'n dod yn ystafell

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.080
yma yn ystafell.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.080
Roedd yn cael gwybod i'r mwyaf o'r ysbyt.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.080
Roedd nid oes yn ymwneud yn ôl.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.080
Roedd yn gallu ei ddod yn ymwneud ymlaen,

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.080
a'r cysylltiad.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.080
Ond roedd gennych chi ddim oherwydd

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.080
roedd yna protocol yn ymwneud

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.080
ar y gwaith,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.080
a os oes gennych chi'n cael ei gwybod,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.080
roedd y cysylltiad yn ymwneud yn ymwneud

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.080
ar y cysylltiad.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.080
Mae nid oes llawer o ddod yn ymwneud.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.080
Rwy'n credu, unwaith yn dda,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.080
pan oeddwn i'n gweithio

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.080
am ddod o ddod i

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.080
ymwneud ym Mhobol

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.080
yn Afro-Ysbeth

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.080
yn Ysgol Afro.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.080
A pob cysylltiad sy'n mynd

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.080
arall,

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.080
fel cysylltiad teichest

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.080
yn y cysylltiad,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.080
bydd yn dda i gael ymwneud

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.080
a bydd yna dda yn dda

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.080
yn dda,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.080
yn y ffordd o bwyd

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.080
a'r un

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.080
i'r 26

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.080
neu'r 3 i'r 26

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.080
i ddod y bydd yna

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.080
y cysylltiad drwy'r 3rth o 26

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.080
o bwydau yn ymwneud.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.080
A fe wnaethais gwybod,

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.080
a'n gweithio,

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.080
ond fe dda i gael ymwneud

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.080
yn y cysylltiad,

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.080
a'r holl cymaint

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:29.360
ni wedi reulis sesiad Celfewise

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.360
i'r adres cyffredin.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.720
A roedd yn edrych i mi yn amysgwyr

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.360
oherwydd roedd hynny'n

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.480
cymryd i'n ei gwybodaeth,

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.760
ond roedd hi'n

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.120
gwybodaeth.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.880
Ie.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.680
Rwy'n ddim yn gwybod y cyflog

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.880
yn mynd i Australia.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.000
Llywodraeth a llywodraeth

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.160
o'r tunas

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.160

Ym...

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.480
Beth yw hynny?

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.880
Llywodraeth o tunas

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.080
i'r teulu.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.840
Ie.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.960
Rwy'n meddwl, rydyn ni yw

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.680
gallwn ei ffeindio'r blynyddiaeth

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.680
sy'n mynd i'r pethau o brydau o'r gweithredu,

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.520
oherwydd gallwch ei wneud

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.880
yr hyn a phôn

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.520
sy'n cael rhywbeth

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.400
o bryd o'r radiaeth

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.280
i gyrraedd efo.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.520
Yn oed, mae'r holl ddwylo

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.520
o'r technoleg wedi mynd i'r bryd,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.360
yw'n ymwneud?

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.400
Dyna'r rhan amdano.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.640
Yn...

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.040
Dyna un rhan o'n gwaith i mi.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.560
Ond pan ddod i'n gwybod

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.040
i'r section hwn,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.320
roedd yn dda iawn

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.200
o ddodau o'r teimio'r brydau.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.440
A gallwch chi ddod i 100 teimio y dydd.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.560
Yn ymddygiad i'r teimio

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.800
oedd cwmpas.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.440
Ac roedd y cwmpas yma

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.560
sy'n mynd i'r gweithredu,

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.520
a ddod i'r cyd-leisio

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.320
a phobl i gael

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.600
a phobl i gael beth.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.040
Ac...

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.520
roedd y teimio'n ddod i'r gweithredu

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.400
i'r cyd-leisio'r gweithredu,

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.320
sy'n cael ei ddod yn ddechrau.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.560
A roedd hynny'n cael ei ddod

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.760
oherwydd bod y cyd-leisio'n ddod

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.160
i'r cyd-leisio'n ddod,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.240
fel ymchwil,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.160
1,000 teimio.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.680
Ac bob amser rydych chi'n gweithredu,

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.040
roedd yn cael ei ddod,

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.560
roedd yn dda yn y ffordd

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.160
a'i ddod yn dda o'r 1,000,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.880
250 teimio,

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.640
a'i ddod yn y balans o 750.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.000
A pan fyddwch chi'n mynd i'r bwynt

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.840
o hyn,

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.920
roedd y cwmpas yn cael ei ddod

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.160
a'i ddod yn unrhyw ffilio'n system.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.640
Dyna'r bwynt

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.000
oedd gennym ni ddod yn unrhyw ffilio.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.640
Dyna'r ddod yn unrhyw ffilio'n 15 oed,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.120
sy'n mynd i'r ysgol.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.520
A fyddwch ddim wedi'i ddod yn y bwynt

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.640
i gael yr orau,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.320
i gael yr adnodd,

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.320
i gael yr adnodd,

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.560
i gael yr adnodd,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.280
dydw i ddod yn dda.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.640
Fyddwch ddod yn unrhyw ffilio'n ddod

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.440
yn unrhyw ffilio'n ddod,

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.160
oherwydd dyna ddim yn dda,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.200
fel y ffartreidd yn ymwneud.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.920
A allwch chi ddweud beth yw unrhyw ffilio?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.120
Unrhyw ffilio'n dda

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.640
oedd un peth o gweithdorau eletronic,

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.040
sy'n mynd yn ôl y swyddi,

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.280
sy'n cael i chi gyrraedd y canlyniadau

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.120
ar radiw neu teulu?

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.240
Yn y ffordd,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.800
roeddwn i'n credu unrhyw ffilio,

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.960
ond rwy'n gwneud yn gallu ddweud

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.000
beth yw'r gwasanaethau.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.920
A byddai'n ddigwyddodd i'r celfiwyddiad.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.000
Mae ABs hefyd yn cyflwyno

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.720
GHQ.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.000
Mae'r pethau o gweithdorau

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.400
yn mynd i'r pethau o gweithdorau

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.320
yn dda iawn

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.280
sy'n cael ei ddeall

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.600
yn y labiau ymchwil

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.080
a'r gweithdorau sonic

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.320
ar gyfer cyfansoddiadau

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.520
a phethau fel hyn,

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.280
oherwydd yna o'r gwasanaethau

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.760
yn y gwasanaethau yn ABs

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.760
sy'n cael ei ddeall

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.760
gyda'r gwasanaethau ymchwil

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.760
yn y gwasanaethau ymchwil

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.760
yn y Gweithdorau Cymru.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760
Dwi ddim yn un o'r gwasanaethau,

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.760
ond fy mhaid Anita

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.760
yn un o'r gwasanaethau.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.760
A oedd yn gallu ddisgwyl

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.760
beth yw'r gwasanaeth

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.760
neu'n cael ei ddweud.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.760
Ond o ran y byddwn yn cael

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760
ei ddweud yn gweithio

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.760
ar gyfer y gwasanaeth,

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.760
wrth gwrs, rydym yn gwybod

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.760
pan oedd nhw wedi mynd Llangley Park

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.760
a phanau hynny.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.760
A gallwn i ddweud yn fawr

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.760
bod ni'n mynd i'r gwasanaethau

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.760
i'r gwasanaethau

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.760
oherwydd byddwn yn gwybod

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.760
a oes angen i ni gyd yn arfer.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.760

a gydwch chi i ddweud

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.760
ar y gwasanaethau.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.760
A oedd yn 60 oed,

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.760
gallwn i ddweud hynny, 50 oed.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.760
Yn y cyfle o'r gwasanaethau,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.760
oherwydd yn angen i ni gyd,

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.760
neu oherwydd yn angen i chi ddweud,

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.760
byddwch chi'n gallu ddweud

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.760
ar y cysylltiad

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.760
o'r genedlaeth Dennis Horsman.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.760
Gallwn i ddweud hynny

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.760
ar y gwasanaeth.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.760
A mae o brydau o'r pethau arian.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.760
Mae'n rhaid i chi ddweud

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.760
o'r pethau arian.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.760
O'r pethau arian.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.760
Ac ar ôl y dyddiau'n dweud,

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.760
o'r gwasanaethau,

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.760
a roedd llawer o ddweudwyd

ychydig o ddweudwyd

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.760
o'r ddweudwyd o'r llain.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.760
Mae'r llain wedi gwneud y gwasanaeth.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.760
Mae'r gwasanaeth o'r llain

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.760
wedi gwneud rhywbeth

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.760
ar gyfer ymdrech.

Gwasanaethau Chasers.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.760
Maen nhw wedi gwneud i ni

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.760
ddeallu o'r

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.760
fel y llwyf hwnnw o ddwylo.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.760
Order gweithio nr 694

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.760
Yn ogystal â'r bach

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.760
oedd y pethau

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.760
yn cael ei dda

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.760
oherwydd y pethau

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.760
yn cael eu gael

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.760
yn ei fformat

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.760
i amser o bryd

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.760
ond dwi ddim yn gallu dda

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.760
oherwydd y pethau

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.760
yn cael ei dda.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.760
Yn ogystal â'r bach

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.760
oedd y pethau yn cael ei dda

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.760
ac yn ogystal â'r bach

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.760
yn cael ei dda.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.760
Pan oeddwn i'n gweithio yno

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760
roedd 4,000 ffyrdd

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.760
yn gweithio ar y llain.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.760
Mae'n anodd

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.760
pan ddweswch ymlaen

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.760
bod y pethau yn cael eu gael

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.760
roedd 4,000 ffyrdd.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.760
Ond oedd y cwmni o'r

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.760
ymlaen wedi bod

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.760
os yna 4,000 ffyrdd

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.760
yn gweithio ar y llain?

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.760
A roeddwn i'n gweithio

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.760
ychydig o ddwyloedd yno

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.760
ac rwy'n gallu

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.760
yn gallu ei dda.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.760
Rydyn ni'n cael idea

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.760
yn y gweithiau, Anita Cummins

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.760
a fy hun, oherwydd gallwn ni'n cael gael

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.760
llawer o weithiau cymdeithasol.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.760
Rydyn ni'n cael idea yn y gweithiau

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.760
oherwydd oherwydd o weithiau cymdeithasol.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.760
Mae'n anodd

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.760
fod y pethau yn cael eu gael.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.760
Un o'r llesau yn dod i mi

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.760
ac roedd fy ffrindiau'n cael ei gael.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.760
Roedd yn cael

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.760
yr adnoddau'r llesau

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.760
lle

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.760
roedd

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.760
yn cael ymlaen

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.760
fel pethau o weithiau

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.760
yn cael ei gael.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.760
Roedd yn cael ei gael ymlaen

yn ymlaen

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.760
ac roedd师l

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.760
yn cael y如果

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.760
o'i formulaeth

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.760
sydd anfodd

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.760

Sand т hun

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.800
oedd o'n nhw wedi cael eu haws, beth sy'n mynd i'n digwydd, a hynny.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.600
Felly roeddwn i'n mynd i'n ddod, ac roeddwn i'n ddweud i fy fater

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.520
bod y dynion hwn yn mynd i'w gwneud yn dda, Henry Jones,

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.960
ac roedd hi wedi bod yn unrhyw ddwyll.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.720
A fy fater yn gweithio yn y coleriol fel ddwyll,

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.480
a roedd hi'n dweud, oedd yn ffynu, oherwydd maen nhw'n edrych ar

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.520
unrhyw ddwyll yn y dyffredin.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.040
Felly roeddwn i'n dweud, a oeddwn i'n dweud, a dylwn Henry i ddechrau ar y ddwyll

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.920
pan nad yw'n gwybod fod yn redendant.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.200
A'r ddwyll yma'n ymwneud â'r ddwy f squad dros ddwy fydd.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.960
Ac roeddwn i'n dweud, a ti'n dweud am y ddwyll?

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.920

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.000
ac roedd yn cael y gweithred, roedd yn ymddangos ymddangos.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.360
Ac roedd yn dda iawn i'n ddod oherwydd

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.760
fy fater oedd yn cael ei gynhyrchu

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.000
yn dda iawn i'r ddiddordeb,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.320
roedd yn cael'n ddysgu'r ddysgu Parkinson.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.600
Ac yn y peth yna, yn y peth,

roedd gennych gwybwynt o'r llwyf,

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.840
oherwydd rydyn ni'n cael ffyrdd llwyf.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.640
Y bloc, roedd yn llwyf,

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.600
roedd wedi'i llwyf yn llwyf ar y peth.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.080
A roedd, bob ddwy ddigwydd, Henry,

yn y peth o llwyf,

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.160
roedd yn oed, oherwydd,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.480
cymhwysoedd dimensiwn o'r

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.520
bachet, efallai,

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.800
bloc gwahanol.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.360
A bob ddwy ddigwydd,

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.720
ar y ffrid,

roeddwn yn cael ei ddod oherwydd i ddod i weithio,

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.800
ac y bloc roedd yn y ddod oherwydd.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.360
Nid oedd yn dda ffyrdd fy fater

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.560
oedd yn angen ei gynhyrchu

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.560
pan oedd yn angen gweithred.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.200
Mae hynny'n cymryd

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.640
fel y ffaith

rwy'n dweud y byddwn i ddweud

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.720
rhai cymdeithasol.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.400
Ie, byddwn i'n mynd i ddweud.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.440
Pan oedd yn mynd i'r gweithred,

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.280
roeddwch wedi'u gweithredu

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.520
cymdeithasol i'r gweithred?

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.080
Nid,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.640
nid oedd yn fel y Gweithred Cymdeithasol

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.680
neu'r Llywodraeth Llywodraeth

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.440
lle roeddwch wedi'i gweithredu

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.280
unig mwyaf o 3 GSCs.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.160
Rwy'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gweithredu.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.080
Roeddwn i'n gweithredu

fy A-lefelau

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.720
a fy gweithredu cymdeithasol.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.000
Felly, gallwn i ddod i gweithredu gweithredu.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000

yn y gwaith ymlaen.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.560
Dyna beth y byddai'n cymryd i chi'n ei wneud.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.280
Ac, yn y peth honno,

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.040
roedd yno ddod i gweithredu

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.400
unrhyw ddwy gwaith yn y gwaith.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.240
Roedd hynny'n gweithredu

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.400
fel ymwneud ymlaen

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.360
ac y gwaith yn cymryd i'n gweithredu.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.120
Beth o'ch ddau cymdeithasol chi wedi gweithredu?

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.320
A gallwch chi ddod yn fwy o ddau o'r ddau o'r gwaith?

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:14.880
O, oes,

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.600

Roeddwn i'n ymwneud efo ymlaen

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.160
a'r ddau cymdeithasol yn dod.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.880
Felly, roedden nhw'n cymryd i chi i gyrwyd.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.080

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.820
ac roedd yn y ffordd ymlaen o'u bywyd,

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.820
a roedd yn y ffyrdd ymwneud â'r gweithiau,

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.820
Roedd yn y ffordd ymlaen o'u bywyd,

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.820
roedd yn y ffordd ymlaen o'u bywyd,

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.820
yn ABs,

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.820
gyda'r hynny,

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:27.820
a'r gwerthfawr.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:28.820
Roedd yn dweud,

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.820
o, rydyn ni am gweithio ar hyn,

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:31.820
a dwi'n gwybod,

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.820
gallwn gweithio arall,

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:33.820
oherwydd byddai'n dda i'n dda iawn.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.820
Dyna ddim ymlaen.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.820
Roeddwn i'n mynd o ABs,

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.820
un peth o bach,

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.820
o bach rydw i wedi'i gadael i gydag gwaith eraill,

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:47.820
a'i gadael yn helpu a'i gadael yn dda.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.820
Roedd yn dda iawn fwyaf,

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.820
mewn bach i gydag gweithio.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.820
Y sysdau yma oeddol,

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.820
oedd yn effeithiol,

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.820
dydyn nhw ddim yn gallu gael ei ddynnu.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.820
Mae'n gwybod bod y gwerthfawr yn gweithio yr un.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.820
Roeddwn i'n gwybod,

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.820
ac roeddwn i'n mynd i ABs

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.820
o ran 2 neu 3 mlynedd.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.820
Ac roeddwn i wedi'i reoglifio'r gwerthfawr

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.820
ar y fflwr ffactor.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.820
Roedd yr un gwerthfawr bwysig,

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.820
roeddwn i'w startio ar y cysylltiedig,

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.820
ychydig o ddau o ddau ar y lles,

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.820
a byddwch chi'n cael y cas.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.820
Roedd yn mynd i'r ddau a phan o'r ddau,

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.820
i ddweud ymlaen,

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.820
a wasi a net.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.820
Mae'n mynd i'r ddau nesaf.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.820
Yna roedd y gwaith yng nghymdeithas i'r ddau i'w bwyno.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.820
Ond pan dwi'n mynd yn ôl,

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.820
ar ôl y peth o blynedd,

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.820
mae hyn wedi'i gweithio,

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:40.820
a roedd yn dda fel y carosel,

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.820
yn y cwmpas,

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.820
gyda unrhyw gweithwyr arno.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.820
Roedd hi wedi cael

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.820
arosau yn y ffordd o'i.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.820
Felly roedd hi wedi cael ei gweithio ar y peth,

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.820
ac yn y blynedd mae'n mynd i'w gweithio,

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.820
roedd hi'n bwysig i'r rhan nesaf.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.820
Felly roedd hi'n dda fel un gwyn,

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.820
yn y cwmpas,

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.820
yn y 30.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.820
Dyna sut mae'r pethau yn cael eu gweithio.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.820
A oes gennych chi'n gweithio?

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.820
A oes gennych chi'n gweithio at all pan oedd hi?

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.820
Mae'n gweithio oherwydd,

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.820
mae'r pethau yn cael eu gweithio.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.820
Roeddwn yn cymryd gweithio ar y gwaith ffyrdd a'r brwyd.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.820
Ond roedd hi'n gweithio yn bwysig oherwydd

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.820
y gwaith gweithwyr sy'n cael ei gweithio arno,

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.820
cael Cony Dixon,

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.820
un pwmpas, un pwmpas,

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.820
a chyfnoddol gwaith,

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.820
yn ddod o'r canso pan oedd yn 26.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.820
A oedd gennych chi ddod o'r cwmpas,

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:31.820
oedd gennych chi gwybwyntiau.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.820
A oes gennych chi gwybwyntiau?

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.820
Nid.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.820
Felly mae'n pethau lles o gweithwyr

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.820
yn cael ei gweithio yn betynau,

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.820
bob betynau,

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.820
yn cael ei gweithio fel bachannol.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.820
A oedd gennych chi'n gweithio fel gwybwyntiau gantometr

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.820
a'n gweithio ar ddod o'r cwmpas,

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.820
yn ystod ymwneud ymwneud y betynau'r gweithwyr

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.820
yn ymwneud ymwneud y gweithwyr

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.820
oherwydd y byddwch chi eisiau calcolaethau i ffyrdd,

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.820
neu triau oes i gweithiau,

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.820
i gweithiau neu rhywbeth fel hyn.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.820
A yna'r gweithwyr yn gweithio yn ystod,

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.820
on you a slip, ready for you to invoice,

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.820
the value of these 37 potentiometers

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.820
at six and six pence each.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.820
So you have that ready for your invoice.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.820
Well, we had a girl working with us,

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.820
brilliant gantometer operator,

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.820
and she had been there when I started work on the section,

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.820
and I think she thought she'd have the promotion,

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.820
but she didn't, I had it.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.820
And they had to take on more girls,

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.820
but I had that promotion,

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.820
and seven and six pence a week,

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.820
increasing my wages.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.820
Now you were responsible for handling

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.820
a million pounds worth of invoices a month,

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.820
and you were to balance the books

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.820
for the accounts department.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.820
They liked you with invoices

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.820
to be less than their money was coming in,

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.820
so that it looked as if,

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.820
oh, we're in the black.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.820
And Nita, my friend, and I,

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.820
never went on annual holidays

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.820
the same time as anyone else,

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.820
because we had to get all the paperwork finished

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.820
and up to date,

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.820
so wherever the factory would close on a Friday,

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.820
I couldn't go on holidays or book a flight until the Monday.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.820
Right, I'm going to ask you then,

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.820
can you remember how much you were paid

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.820
a week and a month?

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.820
When I reached 21,

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:43.820
which in industry was when you reached your mature wage,

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:49.820
I was on four pound, nine and six pence,

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:53.820
and I told the girl on the section I was working,

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.820
ooh, look, I've got my full pay now,

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.820
four pound, nine and six pence.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.820
She'd been there a few years and she said,

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.820
well, I only got four pound, eight and six pence.

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.820
I don't think it's fair you should have a shilling a week more than me.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.820
Five, P in our money now.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:14.820
And she went and queried it with our head of department,

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.820
and they took my extra shilling off me.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.820
They didn't give John an extra shilling,

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.820
like they just took mine.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.820
There was odd ways they did things.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.820
When health and safety came in,

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.820
it was very basic, the rules.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.820
You were allowed so much square footage to work in.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.820
At that time, we'd been moved into a partitioned office

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.820
inside the dispatch department,

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.820
and we were overcrowded.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.820
And I had read the Health and Safety Act and worked out.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.820
We were entitled, I think it was to 45 square feet,

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.820
45 square feet per person,

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.820
and we didn't have anywhere near that.

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.820
So I went to the head of department and said,

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:06.820
look, we're entitled to 45 square feet.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:10.820
Now that included headroom because there was a ceiling.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.820
And when we went in the next day,

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.820
we had 45 square feet because they'd taken the ceiling off the office.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:21.820
So they had ways of getting round it, like.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.820
Because with no ceiling, the noise in there was insufferable,

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.820
but you just got on with it, just got on with it.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.820
And then I asked for an overhead lamp

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.820
because it was very dark when I was working in the corner,

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.820
a little desk lamp, and they gave me one that you dare not touch

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.820
because you'd take the skin off the palm of your hand.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.820
It just got so hot.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.820
But they are. Loved it.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.820
Wouldn't change it for the world.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.820
To go back to the wages, what was the parity then?

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.820
We weren't held in comparison with the factory.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:58.820
They had their own rates of pay because they had their own union.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:04.820
They were with the general workers, an electronic union, something like that.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.820
But the staff had no union at all.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:11.820
The shop floors wages were worked out nationally,

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.820
so they had national representation,

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.820
and they had cost of living rises.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.820
Every year in the office, it was like a concession

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.820
whether that cost of living rise ever filtered through to the office staff.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:30.820
Now, we had no trade union, and I felt very strongly that we needed it.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:36.820
And at the time, what was called the clerical and administrative workers union

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.820
was pushing for recruitment.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.820
Now, how I got old of this, I don't know,

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.820
but we had a fella called Phil Saunders come up.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.820
He couldn't come to the factory.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.820
We had to meet secretly in a public house called the Junction in Abercunna.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.820
Be very selective when you're asked to go,

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.820
because a lot would take this information back to the management.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:08.820
We joined the union there, and we had to recruit people in the offices to join us,

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.820
and we had to secretly collect the money every month.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.820
They donated, so we had to collect in each office.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.820
But of course, we had to make representation to the management

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.820
when we felt we'd got strong enough to hold our own.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:29.820
And my friend at the time, Anita Cummins, myself and Anne from Kilfrw,

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:36.820
we were pulled up before the very head, Mr Croc, and nearly lost our jobs,

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:45.820
but argued our case that it would be beneficial to the directors and the factory owners

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.820
if we had the same representation as the shop floor,

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.820
and they hadn't had any strikes going on, and we didn't anticipate any either,

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.820
but there could be an improvement in conditions on both sides.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.820
So that's what we did.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:02.820
And I think that clerical and administrative workers eventually evolved into unison.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.820
So that was how we started.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.820
All right, yeah, yeah.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:16.820
What about parity with the men workers?

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.820
Do you know?

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.820
Oh, no, there was no parity.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.820
Salary parity, you must be joking.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:26.820
You didn't know who and what for a start,

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:31.820
but you knew the men were on at least 75% more than you.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.820
And the old argument was always they got families to keep,

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:43.820
and it was as if the whole of the male population classed a working woman,

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:49.820
whatever her personal circumstances, as working for, in inverted commas, pin money,

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:54.820
where a lot of these women, particularly single women like myself,

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.820
were working to support yourselves.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.820
You had practically the same outgoings,

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:06.820
and I can remember when I was made head of the section

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.820
and I had my seven and six pence extra,

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.820
that I actually didn't have anything extra in my pay packet

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.820
because I was single and paid the full insurance stamp,

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.820
and the other women working there were married and paid a reduced,

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.820
and I had less money.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:25.820
And I went to the very, very head of my department and put this case to him,

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:30.820
and he said, well, unfortunately, I'm not responsible for your marital status.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.820
So that was how it worked.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.820
There was no comparison.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.820
Was this something you brought up with the union?

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:45.820
Yes, yes, it was, but the wheels would grind very slowly, very slowly,

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.820
and you always felt that union or no union,

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:53.820
there was that little threat that in the next redundancy you might be on the list.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.820
When did the redundancies start in NAB?

00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.820
They came quite frequently.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.820
You'd have them every now and again.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.820
The order book would look empty, future order book.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.820
Redundancies don't depend on how much work they got at the time.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.820
It depends on how much is on the order book,

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.820
and if the order book for the next six months looks bad,

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.820
they're not going to keep you on lipix app

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.820
because then you had your choice of workers.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:25.820
It was like the old collaries years ago when they were privately owned.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.820
They would rather lose a miner in an accident than a horse

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.820
because you had to pay for a horse, you didn't have to pay to replace a miner.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.820
There was always somebody waiting to go in, and it was a bit like that in NABs.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:42.820
There was always a queue of women ready to go in there.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.820
Did you become an official with the union?

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:53.820
Yeah, they were shop stewards on the floor, but we were reps.

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.820
We were just repping.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:02.820
My father had been a secretary of the miners' union in the deep Dufferin colliery here.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.820
I can remember him saying to me,

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:12.820
you don't want to take that position because you'll find that whenever you go in to defend anyone,

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.820
they're generally in the wrong anyway.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.820
Your problem will be that you'll see both sides and you'll want to say,

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:25.820
well, timekeeping is appalling, your sickness record is awful.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.820
He said you can't, you're representing those people.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:35.820
So I found it quite difficult really because I was technically in my mind a management person.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.820
I supported management.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:40.820
Did it go against you with the company though?

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.820
No, no, they cared much.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.820
They knew we had no teeth, a dog without teeth.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.820
But we had started it.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:55.820
I left not long after and it was up to other people to run with the ball then.

00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:01.820
But anyone who had a bit of a position in the office wasn't going to join

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.820
because they weren't going to penalise what they already had.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.820
So what you had there was more juniors like,

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.820
and they wouldn't have had the backbone to stick up for the union,

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.820
they'd have just let it go.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.820
We've seen what happened to unions now.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.820
Half the workforce would be in it, half weren't.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.820
They couldn't see the point of it.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:26.820
It's been dead and buried now since the pits closed really.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:31.820
What did you spend your wage packet on?

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.820
Well, I never seemed to have any savings.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.820
Other girls would have savings.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.820
We had a little security guard there.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.820
They had their security hat out and you had shifts.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.820
We had this little security guard called Freddie Griffiths.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:51.820
He had been a schoolteacher, quite an elderly man.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:57.820
Every Monday morning, Freddie Griffiths would come round the whole of the staff

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.820
with a little tin and national savings stamps.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.820
You paid half a crown for a stamp and you had a little book.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:10.820
You'd give the book up and you'd have a pound to a page, eight half crowns.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.820
Five pound, the book would be worth five pound.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.820
I never got the five pound. I'd always been cashier mine before then.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:24.820
My friend Barbara would throw her full books in the drawer ready for our holidays.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.820
I used to look at her in amazement.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.820
I'd think, how the hell can you do that?

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:33.820
She said to me once, I'd just throw my pay packets in there sometimes

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:39.820
and I'd be walking from the bus stop in Mountain Ash up to Chanstri Lane,

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.820
that's the length of the main street.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.820
Of course there were plenty of shoe shops and dress shops.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.820
By the time I got home, I didn't have any money.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.820
That was my Friday. It was terrible.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:56.820
You'd have these fantastic nights out.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:02.820
When you say to people now, 17 pence for a drink,

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.820
which would cost you now about £2.50 I suppose,

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.820
they say, ooh, it was a great one.

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:12.820
Yeah, but you'd be going out with £1.50, 30 bau ble,

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.820
and perhaps you'd have a meal and all out of that.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.820
It was glorious.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:23.820
I always had the best of clothes because where the others would take their bit of money

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.820
and go to Cardiff or Ponty and buy something,

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:32.820
I'd go into the local dress shop and I'd be paying £2 a week off a card

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.820
so that I looked well dressed.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.820
No, it was useless, absolutely useless.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.820
Did you say goodbye to your mum?

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.820
No, I thought we were rich.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:47.820
I was 27 before I discovered we weren't rich and my mother was keeping me.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.820
It was ridiculous.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.820
She was cleaning a bank and a chapel.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:57.820
My father was working overtime and I was spending my money walking up the mount.

00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.820
No, I didn't have a clue.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.820
I thought we were rolling in it.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:06.820
No, it was a big shock to me to find out we weren't.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:13.820
Can you tell me then about your big productivity drive and what was behind it?

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.820
Oh, yes, yes.

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:18.820
My mother and I were always big ladies, right?

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.820
Oh, can I, sorry, can I?

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:21.820
Okay.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:27.820
My mother and I, well, we've got to go back a bit further than my mother and I.

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:33.820
My mother and the giant boiler in the chapel.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:47.820
Behind us was a doctor's surgery and he trusted my mother to burn the drug samples in the boiler

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.820
and also his medical books.

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:55.820
So my mother now was one of the best informed amateur doctors in the valley.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:02.820
She kept all the books and she would go through all the boxes of drug samplers

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:08.820
till she came across something that ended in D-R-I-N, Dreem.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.820
Dexadreem, amphetamine, anything like that.

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.820
Not knowing then, but we know now, that they were dangerous drugs.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.820
And we knew about the dexadreems because in the war,

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:27.820
my uncle used to send us tins of rations that the soldiers had in Burma.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:32.820
And when you opened them, there was a little packet in there with little yellow tablets called dexadreem.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:36.820
Well, of course, these poor soldiers were taking these, wipe them up and keep them going.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:40.820
When my mother discovered that, she ended up with four cleaning jobs

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:43.820
because, of course, she had this abundance of energy.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.820
Also, she wasn't eating.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:51.820
So she eventually weighed ten stone instead of her normal twelve stone seven.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:57.820
So when those tins stopped coming, but the doctor samples took over

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.820
and we had all these Dreems, we got on to them.

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.820
When that stopped, because that particular doctor died,

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:09.820
we, at that time, they prescribed a lot of slimming tablets on prescription.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:14.820
Some of these were called durofet and they were amphetamines.

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:19.820
And in the invoicing section at the end of the month, you had to work like slaves.

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:23.820
You had to turn the work out, you had to hit the financial targets.

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:26.820
You had to go, oh dear, dear, it was dreadful.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:31.820
So there was five girls there and I'd give each one of them a dexadreem or an amphetamine.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:36.820
God, God, there were sparks coming out of the typewriters the invoices were being.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:40.820
They couldn't keep up with us in dispatch, we were like maniacs.

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.820
And we'd do that for about two or three days and then it would go out of their systems

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.820
and they'd be like wet rags.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.820
But of course it was always in my system because I took it.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.820
Well, we got to the stage now where they were going to withdraw these off the market

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.820
and people on the line, everybody was on them.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.820
They had very high targets to reach on the line,

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.820
but they made them and they exceeded them and their bonuses were terrific.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:08.820
When they finally stopped prescribing these tablets, we were all like wet rags.

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:14.820
I'm surprised ABs didn't go bankrupt because we'd all be staring at each other

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:19.820
and withdrawal symptoms and nasty with each other and everything like that.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:24.820
So I knew that my friend Anna was working with us.

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:29.820
I had given her some tablets called Phylon, little yellow ones,

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.820
and she was having a house altered.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:37.820
And I said, can you fetch some of those Phylons in, look we're all half dead.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:41.820
I've warmed in the time, she said, but they fell down between the floorboards

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.820
and they've nailed the floorboards back in the bedroom.

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.820
I said, oh, get the boards up.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:50.820
So she went home and she lifted the floorboards in our bedroom

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:55.820
and came back with these packet of dust-covered yellow tablets

00:49:55.820 --> 00:50:00.820
and we all took them and hit our target for the end of the month.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:06.820
But they were, god, have we survived, I don't know, but we all looked so nice.

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:10.820
We had lovely clothes and our figures were lovely in our houses.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:14.820
You could do a full day's work, go home, strip the wallpaper off,

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:19.820
re-paper and do the washing and ironing and turn up for work the next day.

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.820
But we didn't abuse them, we only ever took one.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:27.820
It was these people who were taking six and seven that gave them a bad name.

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.820
At least that was our theory.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.820
No wonder we thought ABs was wonderful.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.820
What was, just talking about the factory a little bit again,

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.820
what were the facilities like?

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.820
Appalling.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:53.820
There were four factories all built in the same style.

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:57.820
You know what factories look like. Huge, huge airplane hangars.

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.820
Noisy.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.820
Glass roofs that had to be painted in the summer

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:07.820
because the temperature would be up to 90-odd and you'd be nearly dying there.

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:12.820
Parts of the factory floor would be taken up with partitioned offices,

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.820
which were extremely noisy.

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:20.820
To overcome this health and safety thing about not sufficient space,

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.820
nearly all of them had their ceilings removed.

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:32.820
For the staff, you had one toilet in the office block that was built out the front.

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:39.820
For the girls on the shop floor, I think there was one block of toilets per factory floor.

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:44.820
In the winter, you froze and in the summer you roasted

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:50.820
until I found out where you could switch the gas heater and fans on

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:55.820
and I'd be down there sneaking behind God knows what to press the switch

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.820
so that we had a bit of warmth going through the factory.

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:00.820
No, the conditions weren't good.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:06.820
But you had a trolley that came round twice a day, not one trolley, you had about six,

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:10.820
with refreshments on it for the girls on the line.

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:15.820
We'd send him one from the office out to buy what we wanted,

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.820
from pasties to pies to whatever.

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:26.820
You had two nice canteens, segregated, one for the factory workers, one for the staff,

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:30.820
and you also had a third one for the directors,

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.820
but we didn't eat with the factory girls in their canteen.

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:38.820
We had our own little canteen, which was a bit better service on it.

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:51.820
The canteens, the food was lovely and the staff canteen had a marvellous cook.

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.820
We really, really enjoyed that.

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.820
But you only had half an hour break and in that half an hour,

00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:01.820
most of us would try to walk around the factory because when you went in,

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.820
you sat at your desk, you didn't get up much,

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:09.820
which now I suppose would be the equivalent of a long haul flight.

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.820
So you were all at risk of bloody thrombosis looking back.

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:21.820
And you only had one nurse there who tended to mine a cut or whatever that went into her.

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:26.820
So a couple of first aiders I suppose, but that was all the medical care you had there.

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.820
Were there any accidents, stuff like that?

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:34.820
Well, there would be on some of the machines because you could get

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:41.820
hands cooked in presses and acid splashes in the plating shop and things like that.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:47.820
But they'd haup them up to the hospital I suppose, wouldn't they?

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:54.820
OK, two more things. Just the holidays and a social life, OK?

00:53:54.820 --> 00:54:01.820
The holidays, you had the factory fortnight, if you remember,

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:06.820
and the miners fortnight. And it was always the same.

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:11.820
You had to take those two weeks off. There was no staggered holidays. The factory closed.

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:17.820
But before the factory would close, you'd have a full stop take of everything.

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:23.820
That took staying on in the nights for people in my position now, not everybody,

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:29.820
and getting the lists through from the stores, stores in every factory

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:34.820
because they all made different things, and typing up out stock sheets.

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:39.820
I never went on holidays at the same time because I had to get all the work out

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:46.820
and the invoices and all this kind of thing. I'd always go on the Monday and come back on a different day.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:50.820
I'd have an extra day tagged on at the end.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:55.820
You had breaks for Christmas, but you didn't have five weeks holiday or six weeks holiday,

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:59.820
like people are accustomed to having now. That didn't exist.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:04.820
And part-time workers didn't have the same rights as full-time workers

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:08.820
because they did have the occasional part-time worker.

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:13.820
And on the shop floor, they did have what they called a twilight shift,

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:19.820
which most married women with children went on, and that was from six till ten at night.

00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:27.820
But there was no long holidays, and the sickness scheme was quite good.

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:35.820
I was particularly ill at one time, and I can remember going on full pay for a month.

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:41.820
Half pay for a month, and then nothing.

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:48.820
You'd claim your sickness benefit off the government, but that would be deducted out your wages anyway.

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:51.820
So you only had your wages, really.

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.820
Where did you go on holiday?

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.820
I used to go to Ireland every year.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:02.820
Easter time, I'd go grab a couple of days, Whitson,

00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:08.820
and my fortnight holiday was always in Ireland because I had family and friends.

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:13.820
So I'd occasionally go up to Rhyl and have my cousins up there, but I always went there.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:17.820
It was the introduction of the cheap holidays abroad,

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:23.820
and a lot of the people then were catching out of Benidorm, out to Spain,

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:26.820
and it was the claim to fame then that you went abroad.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:32.820
But I never had that urge at all, partly because I don't like the sun, and the sun doesn't like me.

00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:40.820
So that's where I'd go, Ireland, with my holiday pay, because I wasn't the one who saved for the holidays.

00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:44.820
What about social activities then?

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:51.820
There was a big social scene there, because remember now, there was a lot of women there

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:59.820
whose husbands wouldn't have appreciated them going out for head nights if they had existed at all.

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:06.820
What they wanted was, men didn't mind going out in a busload of women

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:11.820
over to Llamenw for chicken and chips.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:12.820
That was alright.

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:19.820
But we got a bit wiser then, and we used to organise something to the Queen of Hearts in Nelson,

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:26.820
where there was a show going on and a jig about, and still say we were only going over to Llamenw,

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:32.820
and the Helmane Club in Asc and the Ocean Club in Cardiff.

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:38.820
But you never showed him the photos of where you went when you were all dressed up, that kind of thing.

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.820
But a marvellous social life, marvellous.

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:47.820
And I can remember organising a dinner up in a local hotel called Aubrey's,

00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:57.820
and he did meals, cooked dinner now, for I think there was 150, 200 hours in buses went up to Aubrey's,

00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:06.820
had this meal, and at the time it was the fastest milkman in the West was the song.

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:10.820
I forget the name now, the fellow who used to sing it.

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:17.820
And we dressed up as him, and there was a backing group, and they came in,

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:22.820
and I was dressed in this mack with a tampon down as the milkman and all this.

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.820
It was hilarious, we had hilarious nights.

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:37.820
And when you consider that this was a small local pub, and they could produce, all at the same time, 150 cooked dinners, it was amazing.

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:48.820
So we were talking about the social activities, you had, well, sorry, I wanted to say.

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:54.820
Yes, the night we did this big dinner for 150 women,

00:58:54.820 --> 00:59:00.820
and we decided to do this act to Benny Hill's fastest milkman in the West.

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:05.820
There was one line in it that said, when he was supposed to be taking a bath in the milk,

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:12.820
and it came up to my chest, and I was there in an old mack and a tampon,

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:20.820
and I had this policeman's truncheon wrapped in red, silver, shiny paper, and I had it under my mack.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:28.820
And as we came to that line, and it came up to my chest, I let it emerge slowly between my bust up to my chin,

00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:37.820
and the whole place erupted. We were absolutely screaming, they thought it was fabulous. Everybody enjoyed it.

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:48.820
So, the camaraderie in the factory, and do you still see these friends now?

00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:57.820
Yes, I'm still friendly with at least half a dozen people I worked with.

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:02.820
A lot of people, of course, in the interim have passed on or moved away.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:11.820
I mean by friends in constant touch. One of my friends has moved down to Aberdellis Way,

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:25.820
and we phone each other every other day. You see people in town, you talk to them as if you were all still working together.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:33.820
You feel when you've heard of a tragedy in their lives, you feel like you did in A Bs.

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:44.820
Sympathy, empathy, you want to help. One of the young ladies who was working with us was expecting a baby,

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:52.820
and she wasn't married, and we had a weekly collection until we could buy a cot and a pram and everything else,

01:00:52.820 --> 01:01:02.820
because there was no help then, and there was a stigma attached to anything, but we made sure that that didn't happen to her.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:11.820
She was taken under our wing, and there were times there when we were low paid and needed something very much,

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:18.820
and we had a lovely lady a lot older than us, and she was like our mentor on the section,

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:28.820
and you'd only have to say, oh Megan, can you get me a pair of skollars on your cock book, or can you get me a pair of booties on your cock book,

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:38.820
and she'd do it and we'd pay her back half a crown a week. That was the sort of situation that we were in, where now I don't think that would ever arise anywhere.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:53.820
We had a lady working in our office, and she owned an off licence in Nelson, and every week we'd give her half a crown, half a crown was the standard currency,

01:01:53.820 --> 01:02:06.820
but all we could afford, and then Christmas time we'd have cherry brandy and egg flip and all these kind of exotic things to take home and have a festive Christmas.

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:17.820
So yes, you pulled together and there was no snobbery because nobody had anything to be snobbered about. We were on the same wages and in the same circumstances.

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:20.820
Did you mix with women on the floor as well?

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:33.820
No, I didn't, I didn't, because I had my little circle of friends there, and of course there were people in the office who had sisters and brothers and mothers working in the factory,

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:45.820
and it was very much a family place. You'd have three or four sisters working there and mothers, and because where it was located in Annis-a-Borth,

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:59.820
with a lot of housing and housing estates around it, there was a tremendous amount of walk-to-work people were employed there, where we went down on the factory buses and came home on the factory buses.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:13.820
But that disappeared after a while. Well, people could go further afield because more work came. When ABs started, ABs was the only thing around here,

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:23.820
and to think that there had at one time been 4,000 people working there, you know, and suddenly now I expect there's not 200.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:27.820
What did that mean, do you think, to women of your generation?

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:45.820
It freed them, it freed them up. It meant that they had their own money, that they had the support of their peers, that they weren't tied to the house and thought of as domestics.

01:03:46.820 --> 01:04:01.820
It freed them from domestic employment outside of the home. There'd always been a category where if you weren't nursing or teaching, you were shopkeeper in a shop or you were doing cleaning.

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:09.820
Well, that disappeared. You were suddenly in a factory, you had your own social scene and you had your own income.

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:19.820
Mind there was a lot of marriages that didn't stand it either, but that props they wouldn't have anyway. You don't know, do you?

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:22.820
On the whole, do you think they were good employers?

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:38.820
Yes, I do, I do. You see, you thought of yourself as part of ABs, and in the beginning when I was there, ABs still had visits from the men who owned it.

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:48.820
The Marx brothers would come down from London, two very handsome men, and they'd walk amongst the lines and chat almost like royalty.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:05:06.820
You were directors then, Mr. Crock and Ray Gent and Brown who lived here. They'd come on the factory floor, they'd walk around, but they had that little air of authority and power and that.

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:22.820
But yes, it was a lovely place to work. There was a yearly competition for Miss ABs, and ABs would put on the most fabulous Christmas do's in the City Hall in Cardiff or Sapphire Gardens or wherever.

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:43.820
It was a dress-up and elbow gloves and silver shoes, and they'd pay for the meal, and all the tables would be laid out with white linen, and you'd have spaced out along the tables those gorgeous Sobrani cigarettes that looked like rainbows in boxes.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:06:01.820
We'd all be dressed in our finery. It was lovely, and I can remember two girls waiting with me for the bus to take us to City Hall, two sisters, and they both had tiaras on, which I thought was hysterical, but they were lovely, lovely occasions.

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:12.820
They made you feel important and a bit of a bit of a valley setting. You might be back in the Workmans next week, but this week you were in City Hall for Christmas.

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:14.820
Sounds very glamorous.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:23.820
It was, it was. Of course, the women had money for nice clothes, and they used it if they were like me.

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:27.820
So why did you decide to leave?

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:49.820
I had, I left the first time because I had married my first husband, and he went to work in Huddersfield, and I went up with him, and I left, went back then when I married my second husband, and I left because my mother said to me,

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:58.820
You don't want to stay in ABs any longer. You're in your mid-30s and there's no pension scheme there for you.

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:05.820
She said you want to get a job back, because I had worked in local government, back with the council.

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:18.820
So I applied for a job, and I got a job in Mountain Ash Library, and my mother said to me, my mother being my mentor, my conscience, she said,

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:27.820
You can't go and work in the library with your hair that colour. It's alright for the factory, but it's too blonde for the library, so you want to rinse it a bit darker.

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:42.820
So I had a job in the library working for one of our best known poets, Harry Webb, and I was his secretary, and I worked with Harry for a couple of years, and actually got married from there.

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:59.820
They were building the sports centre in Abercanon, and local government was being rearranged, and I applied for a job in the sports centre in Abercanon, and I was the secretary to the manager down there for 18 years.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:08.820
So that's why I left ABs, not because I didn't like it any more, but because my mother said, get out of there, there's no pension.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:12.820
Did they do you a kind of farewell party?

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:25.820
Yes, it was terrible. It was terrible. It was in the top room of the Navi, it was when Madonna was singing I'm a Virgin for the very last time, and they played…

01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:26.820
This was ABs then?

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:42.820
ABs, and we had a meal, they played that song all night, and I left and went to the library in Mount Nash, which was completely different, it was an entirely Victorian type of atmosphere, the library.

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:50.820
I'd worked in Aberdale Library on this one, and you were expecting Charles Dickens to come through the door any time. The discipline was unbelievable.

01:08:50.820 --> 01:09:08.820
But of course I was militant, and I can remember getting the union involved because I felt that the head librarian was picking on a little girl who was diabetic by keeping a dossier on her, and I wouldn't put up with that, so I called the union in.

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:17.820
And after the meeting he came on to me and he said, I do like a woman with a bit of guts. So that had gone down alright.

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:23.820
So looking back now, how do you feel about the time you spent working in the factory?

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:34.820
I'd do it all over again if it was still the same. Absolutely loved every minute, and you had a tremendously supportive network there.

01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:44.820
There are times in my life when I would not have survived the tragic things that were going on had it not been for my friends and colleagues in that factory.

01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:50.820
Now I completely endorse my time there. Wonderful. Loved it.

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:53.820
Fantastic. Thank you very much.

01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:55.820
How long was that last date?
