00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.560
It's not just about the images here, it's how you feel in your heart, that's the key.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.520
It's about understanding pain, knowing it's not your enemy, it's life trying to show

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.400
you the person that you can really be.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.280
Maybe I've been learning not to run away from the pain.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.200
I know it's hard, everybody feels the same, but what I've learned is to step in out from

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.200
a gate.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.200
I've stormed me to love instead of hate.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:51.920
Thinking of the place I left behind, leaving for a memory is in my mind.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:03.920
Sometimes it's hard to live and say, but things are meant to be the same.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:29.360
I've laid through the place I left behind, leaving for a memory.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.080
This land holds love as vast as the ocean.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.080
Open hearts are never to be broken.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.480
Living with two tongues, song and spoken.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.480
Strong emotions are not scared to show them.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.360
All of this connection makes people feel related.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.120
That's how a lot of stories were created.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.120
That's how we make many places become one.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.280
Wrote to the future that all become.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.560
This is a podcast about East.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.560
Inrexam.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.280
East stands for.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.320
Ethnic youth support.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.520
Team Wales.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.200
Which is a posh name for a place where young people from ethnic minorities and their families

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.640
can come after school.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.040
And have fun.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.840
And have opportunities.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.880
And feel that they belong.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.200
And feel safe.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.880
Some people who come here are refugees, are silent seekers.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.880
Some aren't.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.800
East support all young people and their families.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.960
This podcast is about what it's like for some of us living in Wales.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.320
And what we think about Welsh history and Welsh culture.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.600
It's also about what we, in our turn, bring to Wales our history and our culture, our

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.360
own rich traditions.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.840
We have created songs and poems and thoughts.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.120
All the words in this podcast have been written or spoken by people in our group.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.840
But sometimes their words will be spoken by other members of the group.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.720
So who are we to introduce ourselves?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.720
I'm Arleith.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.880
I'm originally from Portugal.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.840
I'm a youth worker here at least in Rexam.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.840
I'm Tony and I'm a youth worker here at East.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.920
Although originally I'm from Nicaragua.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.200
I'm Gosha and I'm a regional youth worker here and I'm from Poland.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.960
The song you heard at the beginning was created by Denise, one of our young adult members

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.480
here who studied music at college, with a bit of help from Diego.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.080
Diego is 18 and he's at college now, but studying engineering, not music.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.880
I'm Kelvin, I'm 12.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.040
I'm originally from Portugal like I've ever met.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.680
But now I live here in Rexam with my mom, dad, brother and sister.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.560
School's okay though it gets loud and we get a lot of homework.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.120
But it's good that I learn.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.520
I like PE especially when we do basketball or football.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.200
My name is Mercy Grace and I'm 11.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.480
I was born in Nigeria and my parents come from two different places there.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.160
From Joss in Benway and from Nicaragua.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.520
After we left Nigeria, we lived in leads for a time before coming to Rexam.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.080
I live with my mom, my dad and my two sisters and I go to Clare Dog High School.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.920
I love school.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.400
It's all about learning.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.080
It helps you gain more knowledge for the future.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.200
Also, it's a good and interesting way to make lots of friends.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.240
I'm Trenaza and I'm Mercy Grace's younger sister and I'm nine.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.600
I'm Latissia and I'm 17.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.960
My name is Inshira and I'm eight.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.400
I was born on the 24th of December in Cardiff.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.080
And I live in Wales ever since.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.440
Now I live here in Rexam.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.680
I love baking cookies, pancakes and other desserts.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.960
I've had a great time since we moved to Rexam and I've made lots of friends at school.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.440
What I love is going to new places and chasing sheep.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.280
I hope there aren't any Welsh farmers listening.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.760
My name is Avi and I'm 12 years old.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.600
And I used to live in London before we came here.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.080
I live with my mom.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.640
I'm in year eight at school and I love to play football.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.960
I'm basketball.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.720
My name is Noah and I am eight.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.040
I'm Hadja and I'm eleven.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.720
We didn't exercise for this podcast or we had to pick a word from a big bowl of cut

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.280
out words and write about it.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.680
I chose a word past and this is what I wrote.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.880
To me, London is more busy than Rexam.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.880
Rexam is more quieter.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.560
My past has been sad because my father always used to hit me and my mom.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.640
Since we moved to Rexam, I've been scared because he was always hitting my mom.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.320
But this was the past.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.440
It's better now.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.680
Although now I get bullied at school because of my turban.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.840
People think silent seekers are always running away from war.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.520
Sometimes they are not.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.680
Sometimes they are just running from family relationships.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.320
But some of us have sought refuge from violence in our birth countries.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.080
Some of us have written or spoken about this for this podcast.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.320
Some have chosen not to.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:29.400
Diego, who helped write the song at the beginning, came from San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.840
He said he left five years ago because of the violence there.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:40.280
He said it wasn't like a violent regime, more like two violent rival gangs fighting.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280
Tony here.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.160
I was a journalist in Nicaragua where I did a degree in journalists.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.760
But there were riots about pensions people were against the government.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.440
And I wrote about how the government was not telling the truth.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.000
Soon they were chasing me in the street.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.520
And it was very dangerous for me.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.960
So I left and I became an asylum seeker in Wales.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.480
This was five years ago.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.960
Since then I visit Cardiff and live in London, a handslet in Wrexon.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.400
I'm a musician as well as a journalist.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.720
I play guitar.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:30.080
So when I was in Cardiff, I volunteered with Welsh National Opera and was in three professional

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.760
production as a volunteer.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:39.360
My team composing and performing in a handslet, I volunteer as a youth worker.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.560
Over four years I apply for refugee status five times.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.320
And finally got it in 2023.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:55.680
So now here in Wrexon, since I got my status, I can work as a pay youth worker.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.000
So what's it like coming from somewhere else to live in Wales?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.080
Well, again, I think living in Wales is way different from Portugal.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.760
Here in Wales it has more bad weather.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.800
Like Portugal has really good heart weather and our traditions and culture are way different.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.960
And everyone is always nice and safe streets and people.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.280
Wales has a very different culture to Nigeria too.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.960
For example, we wear normal clothes at home like other people in Wales.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:32.400
But in my culture, the traditional dress for women is a long skirt with a cold fushre

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.840
or a long dress wrapped around the body and tied up the waist.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.880
In bright colour for fabric with a bumpy texture to it and hair ties that are like big pieces

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.320
of cloth wrapped around the head.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.680
They are hard to tie and wear properly.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.760
Only women wear these.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.360
Girls wear headband.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.840
We still wear our traditional clothes for church or special occasions.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.880
Then there's food.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.880
People in Wales eat pasta and fish and chips, but we eat different kinds of food, like

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:13.360
fufu, gari, pounded yam and some soups like egusi, okra and vegetable soup.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:19.640
Longer dress in Wales people speak Welsh or English, but sometimes both.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.320
But I have three languages.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.760
Ibo from my dad, Tiv from my mum and now English.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:35.760
Diego told us he had no English when he came to Wales, but now at 18 he's fluent.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.440
I think living in Wales is good.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.760
I think it's quiet and peaceful.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:46.040
In Leeds it was a lot nausea because the roads were usually busy and cars were always

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.440
passing by.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.440
In Leeds it was harder to sleep because it was always so noisy.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:10:00.280
In Wrexham it's a lot easier to fall asleep.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.480
Excuse me, wake up.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.480
So what do you think of when you think about Welsh history and Welsh culture?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.000
Tony again, what is Welsh culture for me?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.440
Well it is a mix of culture, it is an interesting country and very friendly.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.440
In my opinion, Mahanset has the richest culture.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.760
People there live a simple life.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.800
It seems to have more of Welsh language and the culture they are engaged better with

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.680
teenager.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.680
They have a distinct call No Sons Saur or Laurin.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:55.600
Like open mics, night where people can bring along violins and other instruments and play

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.480
music and sing.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.320
When I think of Welsh culture I think of castles.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.200
Umm, that was a beautiful countryside.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.560
The Welsh flag.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.600
The Welsh language.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.880
Music maybe.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880
Singing.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.400
Rugby?

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.840
We have written some poems and words about different aspects of Welsh life and culture.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.600
Arna, another member of East, has written a poem about Welsh rivers.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.240
River poem.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.920
I like the river how it flows peacefully, moving past slowly gently.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:37.600
I like how the wind ripples the surface, catches the light and glides and chimmas.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.320
I like how the rocks split the river and the waters swirls wobbly round then.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:49.560
I like how it's always moving, always changing, always singing its song.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.800
This is Gossha again.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.080
I have written about the Welsh castles.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:00.920
On the hill of ways where the sea seems to the slip forever, stand majestic castles.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.120
They are like fennful sensitors.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.400
They are yielding to the passage of the time and the rustling of the wind, that carriers

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.160
memories of bygondays.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:21.400
Free of them, Conwy, Carnarfon and Harlech, high history on their walls, like treads,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.040
worn with the blood of heroes.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:30.120
Conwy proudly raced above the river, attracts the eye with its silver walls, ship grace

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.360
on the green pastures that stretch as its fit.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:40.800
The white silhouettes create a contrast with the lush green of the meadows, bathed with

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.240
the glow of the morning sun.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:49.760
Carnarfon builds on the menace straight, looks all out over the surrounding landscape

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.160
from Estonia Hill.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:59.520
The sroyal castle has witness many wars and rules who raised the sword in the defence

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.760
of freedom and the land of ways.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:10.680
These mighty walls still bear the marks of the past battles and in their shadow history

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:18.560
comes alive in the minds of those who respectfully enter its gates.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:26.160
Harlech, standing proudly on a cliff, watches over the stormy sea that crashed against

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.560
the rock at its feet.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:36.160
It was here in the shadow of history that Honour was faultful, never giving up, even

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.240
in the face of the greatest challenges.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:47.880
In the place where history interwines with nature, the wind carries the old songs of ways.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:55.440
Stone and green create a harmonious hole and the castles of Conwy, Carnarfon and Harlech

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:03.440
stand unchanging, guarding the dreams of independence, hope and glory of the nation.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.600
Hadja has written about castles too.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:12.760
She wrote this, I want to see the people in the castles, I want to see the dresses and

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.920
the rooms and the books, I want to see the castles as they used to be before they got broken

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.760
by history.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.720
I want to see the king and the queen on their thrones.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.120
I want to see a suit of arbor tonight on a ghost's bones.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.800
I wish I could be the queen.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.920
I wish I could see all the things that have been.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:42.040
Mercy Grace, in that exercise where we had to pick words out of a bowl, I picked the

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.920
word questions.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:50.600
Some people I know say that asking questions like Hadja doesn't have poem is not important,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.680
but I think it's very important.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.920
Because if you ask lots of questions and you're always curious in class, you'll be very small

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.400
or brilliant.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.320
Asking questions is a very good way to learn.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.920
You can learn ahead and learn about the past and you'll get answers and be more knowledgeable

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.920
about a lot of things.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.760
Diego told us he likes the culture of Wales, the history, the castles.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.480
But he says things are much better in Salvador now than they were.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:26.040
He says now if someone kills someone else, they get picked up and arrested in about five

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.240
minutes so he would like to go back there one day.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:37.760
In October 2024, Arlette and Cadu, the organisation that looks after the Welsh castles, took a group

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.880
of us from East on a visit to Crickf Castle.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.600
Tunaza here.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.240
Afterwards, I wrote this.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.680
Crickf Castle was made by two princes and destroyed by another prince.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.320
It was a fun experience going there.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:59.640
I am so happy that I got to see such a super-calor, fragilistic, expialledosius castle.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.360
Victoria, another member of East, who also went on the trip, wrote a poem about the castle

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.960
called Castle in the Sky.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:13.400
The magnificent castle, seen by all, a vision once imagined.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:19.120
A shadow over those below, once history now a legend.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:26.920
Fits for princes of all of Wales, mighty fortress soaring high, and our land and our nation,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.920
a show of power in the sky.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.960
Mercy Grace, I also wrote a poem about the castle, but from a very different point of

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.960
view.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.240
I am a stone.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.800
I have lived here on the beach for hundreds of years.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.960
I am half white and half brown, and the bottom edge of me is also white.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.760
I feel rough and smooth at the same time.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.320
Back in the day, there was a castle at Crickf Castle, and I have seen everything that went

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.800
on in that castle.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.080
I have looked up to it my whole life.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.800
I can tell you all about it.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:07.360
It was started by a Welsh prince and finished by another Welsh prince, but then an English

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.040
king came and took the castle away from the Welsh people.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:18.240
So another Welsh prince came to take it back from the English king and burnt it down.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.720
This is the story of the castle of Crickets, written by the glorious stone that has looked

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.840
up to it's whole life.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:31.460
As well as her castle poem, Hadja has written a poem about the Welsh flag, like the ones

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.000
fluttering above Cricket's castle.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.480
The Welsh flag is a red dragon.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.920
It has three colours, red, white and green.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.760
The dragon's feet are standing in the green.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.200
The green of grass, the green of leaves, the green of apples.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.800
The red is the colour of blood.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.840
Of the jewels in the king and queen's crown.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.400
The colour of fire.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.880
White is the colour of a wall.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.760
The colour of milk.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.440
The white, like the whites of my eyes.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.080
The flags fly above the castle.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.080
They look beautiful.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.080
Avi here.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:16.640
I liked the trip to Cricket's castle because I liked the beach and we were next to the

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.960
beach and we had lunch.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.200
The food was given by the castle, yum yum yum.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.680
And then we went up to the castle and the food was so tasty.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.960
I loved the view.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.480
And we could put 20p into the telescope to look at the sea.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.800
Thanks for the trip.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.880
I met some new people.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.880
Thank you Aile.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.400
I appreciate you.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.000
The castle was beautiful.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.720
And now here is the writing by...

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.240
No, no, no, I am a...

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.240
And...

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.240
Me in Shira, age 8.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.800
And these next bits are really nothing to do with culture or history at all.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.200
But just go to show how imaginative our young people at East are.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.000
I was told I wasn't very good at writing at school.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.160
And I don't usually like it.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:13.040
But in the workshop when we were giving a bowl of words to choose from, I chose the

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.040
way to enter.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.880
And here's a funny story I wrote all from my imagination.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.880
Here it is.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:25.640
Once upon a time there was a pig that lived in the centre of McDonald's in Raxon.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.760
And the burgers were all gone.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.000
They turned the pig into burgers.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.480
And teed just for the...

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.360
Who's going to eat a burger?

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.560
The end.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.000
I chose the word memories and wrote a funny poem.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.080
Here it is.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.920
My best memory was when I said about my cheese sandwich.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.640
More cheese, more cheese.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.720
And I said it was such a dear please.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.040
But I really wanted a tuna sandwich with two command carrot sticks.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.520
I'd already asked my mum if I could have a normal toast with jam or porridge with a

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.520
bomb.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.960
But I didn't see what food was already inside of me.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.040
I am not Luna so I sneakily said tuna.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.520
Write quite a lot about food don't we?

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.840
Food is comfort.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.400
Last word about living in Wales.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.920
I've developed since coming here.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:24.360
I didn't know that when I first crossed over here that I would lose my identity.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:31.640
In Icaragua I was a journalist, a song to my mum, a brother to my two brothers.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.640
I had a girlfriend.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.960
But coming to Wales I lost everyone.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.040
I lost my identity.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:46.600
My mental health became really bad but my friends I made in Wales helped me.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:52.800
My friends from Wales National Opera helped me with mental health, with my application

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.160
for status, with everything.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.880
I am here now because of these friends and I still have them.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.880
For me Wales is the best place a refugee can be.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.560
And East is part of that.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.680
Supporting people in their lives here.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:16.000
Helping to bring about the future of all our different experiences and cultures.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.600
The place I left behind.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.600
Living for the memories in my mind.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:32.600
Sometimes it's hard to live and change.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:39.600
But things are meant to be the same.
