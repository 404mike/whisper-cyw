I'm Stephanie Cruz, it's the 21st of July 2019, we're up at the Ellen Ballet Visitor Center and I'm talking to Richard.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Richard, today's the 50th anniversary of the Moon Roundings, what are your memories of them?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Well I was a space-obsessed six-year-old at the time and I was living at Carlisle in Cumbria with my parents, obviously,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I remember getting more and more excited with the build-up gradually through the previous missions,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
particularly equipped by Apollo 8 doing the moon orbit and coming back,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and then Apollo 10 basically trying all the technology out prior to the landing.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I remember getting very excited and unable to sleep really, because from memory it was in the early hours of the landing.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I remember my father getting me up and sitting me on the seat in front of the TV in the middle of the night,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
watching it and saying, you know, you'll remember this for the rest of your life.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And yeah, sure enough, absolutely, I've been gripped by space ever since really.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So did your career go into space?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Well it would have been nice, no not really, I'm actually a telecommunications engineer.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Oh, in close contact with you.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I did have an opportunity at one point of actually being interviewed for a job in Australia at the Timbid Villa radio telescope at Canberra,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but I chickened out. But that's about as close as I got.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But yeah, it's always been a great interest to me.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Very disappointed in the way that Apollo sort of stalled, nothing really led on from it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Well it was quite a costly programme, wasn't it?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Yes, it was, and of course Cold War driven.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Great, and now you're back in the area, you moved back in?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We moved back into this area in 2001.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:15.000
My wife is an artist and one of the main justifiers really was to come to somewhere where she could actually do something with her art.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
She's basically made something of that.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
As I say, I'm a telecommunications engineer, so I managed to get a transfer over here because we love the area.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What do you think about Emond Valley, the dams?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's fabulous, one of our favourite places. Love the area and spent a lot of time here.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I used to come up here on motorbikes 30 years ago. Been coming ever since really.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Brilliant, thank you very much for that. That's okay.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
That's really appreciated. Thank you.
