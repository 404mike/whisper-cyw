Roedd hynny wedi'i helpu i gael gwaith?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.680
Nid, dwi ddim yn meddwl.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.680
Dwi ddim yn meddwl.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.680
Ie.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680
Ie.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.680
Felly os oedd gennych chi'n gweithio yma yn 15, beth wnaethon chi'n ei wneud gyda'ch gweithio?

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.680
Roeddwn yn gweithio gyda'r ffatri.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.680
Felly os oedd gennych chi'n gweithio mewn ffatri, roeddai'n gweithio ar ddau o bwynt.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.680
Felly oedd gennych chi ddiddordeb o ffri?

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.680
Nid, ond oedd angen i'n gweithio mewn ffri.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.680
Ond os oedd gennych chi'n gweithio o ddau o bethau?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.680
O, oedd o'n gwybod fy nghyfn fy nghyfn a bethau, ond...

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.680
O'r ffrindiaid.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:28.680
Mae'n cerddol.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.680
Er enghraifft, ac nid oes unrhyw un o'r hyn yn cymryd hynny?

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.680
Ie, ie, ond byddai'r mwyaf Jones ddim'n cael hyn.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.680
A dydyn nhw wedi bod yn cael ei gynhyrchu yn ymdrech?

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:46.680
Yn ymdrech, ond nid oedd y pwmpen yma, ond roedd y pwmpen oedd yng nghymru ar y gwaith yna,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:52.680
ac roedd yna unig yng nghymru, felly pan yna'n ymdrech, roedd y pwmpen yn dod yma,

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.680
ac maen nhw'n rhoi unig.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.680
Ie, felly roedd nhw'n cael eu gynhyrchu yn y Gweinidog?

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.680
Roedd nhw'n cael eu gynhyrchu, nid oeddwn i'n bwysig o'r hyn.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.680
Felly roedd yn credu bod nhw'n cael eu gynhyrchu?

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.680
Ond maen nhw'n cael eu gynhyrchu, maen nhw'n cael eu gynhyrchu,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.680
ddweud, 10 mlynedd, felly roeddwn i ddim yn gweld y pwynt yn…

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.680
A oedd yna unrhyw ddysgwyr neu…

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.680
O, ie.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.680
…dysgwyr am hynny?

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.680
O, ie.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.680
Dwi'n meddwl am y pwynt…

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.680
Wel, ti'n gwybod…

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.680
…a beth oedd wedi'i creu problemau yma?

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.680
Yr hyn yn, yn fawr…

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.680
Roedd yna stricau?

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.680
O, nid, nid, nid stricau.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.680
Nid oedd gennym stricau.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.680
Roedd gennym argymaint, ond nid oedd gennym stricau.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.680
Beth fyddai'n ei fwyllgor chi'n ei fywyd, os nid oedd gennych chi uniaeth, a sut ydych chi…

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.680
Yn oedd y gweithwyr oedd yn dod yn y gweithwyr.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.680
O, iawn.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680
Yn oedd?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.680
Ie.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.680
Felly, fe wnaeth gweithio yn y brifysgol, yn y gweithwyr eich hun,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.680
nid yn unrhyw lline o unrhyw gweithwyr yn oed,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.680
a oedd yn gwneud ymlaen i chi'n ei hun?

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.680
Ie.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.680
Nid, yn oed yn cael ei gael i'r tŷ,

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.680
a yna mae hyn yn mynd i unrhyw gweithwyr.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.680
A bydd rhywun eich hun yn ei wneud?

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.680
A bydd rhywun eich hun yn ei wneud.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.680
Rhaid.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.680
A yna mae rhywun yn ei weithio,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.680
i weld a yna mae'n bryd,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.680
a yna mae'n mynd i'r was,

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.680
a hynny i'r gweithwyr,

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.680
a hynny i'r gweithwyr.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.680
Felly, oedd yn ystod ystod hynny,

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.680
a hynny'n mynd i'r gweithwyr?

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.680
Nid, mae'n mynd i'r gweithwyr sy'n cael ei gael.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.680
Rhaid.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.680
Nid oes gen i beth i chi.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.680
Ond nid oes angen.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.680
O, mae'n rhaid.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.680
Dyna'r peth.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.680
Dyna'r gweithwyr y gallwn ni gweithio ar.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.680
Yn oed, y gweithwyr.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.680
Dyna'r binellfa, yw'n i?

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.680
Dyna'r binellfa.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.680
Ie.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.680
Rhaid.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.680
Roedd hi'n cael ei gweithio,

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.680
ac yna mae'n rhaid i'r binellfa i'w gael ar y gwaith.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.680
Ar y gwaith, fel y gallwch chi weld yna.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.680
A yna rydym ni'n gweithio'r hynny yna, ar y gwaith.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.680
Ar y gwaith?

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.680
Ar y gwaith.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.680
A yna rydym ni'n gweithio ar y gwaith?

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.680
Ar y gwaith, a yna.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.680
Oes.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.680
A gallwch chi weld y...

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.680
Mae'n gweithio ar y gwaith.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.680
Mae'n gweithio ar y gwaith yna.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.680
Yn oed.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.680
Felly, y peth,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.680
yn oed y peth yma,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680
a yna ddim wedi gwneud amdano.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680
Nid yna.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.680
Yn oed.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.680
A dyma yna gyda'r ddyn yma.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.680
O, nid yna, yna'r peth yna.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680
Mae'n gweithio ar y gwaith, i weld,

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.680
felly mae'n gweithio ar y gwaith.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.680
Beth yw chi'n ei ddod yw hynny'n weith?

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.680
Mae'n weithio ar y gwaith.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.680
Mae'n ddod ymlaen i'r ddrydd.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.680
Ie, a dyna'r cabl.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.680
Yn oed yna, a rydych chi'n cael ystamp ar hynny,

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.680
a yna, yna?

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.680
O, ie.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.680
Yna o'r cyfnod?

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.680
Ie.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.680
Oes.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.680
Yn oed yna?

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.680
Mae rhywun o'n ddod hynny?

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.680
Ie, ie.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.680
Dyna ystamp ar hynny?

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.680
Dyna ystamp ar hynny,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.680
am y cyfnod.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.680
Ie.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.680
A yna oedd pobl yn ysbytio bob ymddiriedig

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.680
yn ymwneud?

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.680
Mae'n ymwneud bob ymddiriedig.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.680
Beth os yw rhywbeth yn ddaeth i'w?

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.680
Beth yna'n ddaeth i'w?

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.680
Mae'n ymwneud yn ymwneud,

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.680
ac mae'n rhaid i ni ddod ymlaen.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.680
Nid yn cael.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.680
Mae'n rhaid i ni ddod ymlaen.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.680
Nid yn cael.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.680
Nid yn cael am hynny.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.680
Byddwn yn gael gwaith yna,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.680
os oeddai gael gwasanaeth.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.680
Rhaid.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.680
A oedd hynny'n dda ar hynny?

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.680
Nid, nid yn eithaf,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680
oherwydd byddwn yn rhaid i ni,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.680
byddwn yn rhaid i ni'n bwysig.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.680
Ie.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.680
Yn oed yna oes ystamp ar hynny?

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.680
Ie, ystamp.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.680
Yn oed ystamp.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.680
Yn oed ystamp ar hynny?

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680
Yn oed ystamp ar hynny?

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.680
Yn oed ystamp ar hynny?

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.680
Mae'r casgliad eu bambinoedd.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680
Rwy'n mynd ni'n gwybod.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.860
Mae'r casgliad yn potential,

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.500
seeb o'r 160 m,

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.160
mae'r fasgliad bamboedd yn erbyn un peeioneddoriaeth.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:20.940
Mae'r fasfiadaeth yn ja

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:27.940
roeddwn i'n gweithio ar y cyfan, ac rwy'n gweithio ar y cyfan.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.940
Y cyfan hwnna yw hynny?

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.940
Nid, y cyfan hwnna.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.940
Y cyfan hwnna?

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.940
Christopher y cyfan hwnna. Mae hynny'n fater hwnna.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.940
Ie, iawn. Felly mae'r ffyrm wedi'i ddod yn y ffamiliau ysbryd.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.940
Ie.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.940
Byddwch chi'n dweud y mae'n gwych yn ystod y byddym wedi bod yma?

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.940
Ie, iawn. Oherwydd maen nhw wedi'i adnabod pwylofysau yn ymlaen.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.940
Pwylofysau.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.940
Ond yna, fe wnaeth y cyfan, maen nhw wedi'i adnabod sŵyn yn ymlaen.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.940
Roedd yn gwneud, yw, y tapestri, y beddau,

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.940
y ffrindiau.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.940
Roedd yn cael sgwrs o'r cyfan hefyd.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.940
Roedd yn gwneud hynny eich hun?

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.940
Roedd yn helpu.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.940
Os dydyn ni ddim wedi gweithio ar y sŵyn,

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.940
roeddwn ni wedi helpu yna ar y sŵyn.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.940
A felly roedd nhw wedi gwneud hynny, y tapestri, y clwyddyn?

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.940
Y clwyddyn.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.940
Roedd nhw wedi gwneud y tapestri eu hun?

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.940
Nid, nid, roedd nhw wedi cael hynny yn y ffamiliau.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.940
Roedd nhw wedi cael hynny yn y ffamiliau.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.940
Ond pan oedd hynny, yna?

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.940
Roedd hi'n cael llawer o ddynu pan oedd hi'n cael hynny?

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.940
Roedd hi'n cael hynny.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.940
Mae'n fy 20 oedd, dwi'n credu.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.940
Roeddwn ni'n cael gweithio ar y pethau'n bwysig.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.940
Yn oed, os dydyn ni ddim wedi gweithio ar un ystafell,

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.940
roeddwn ni'n cael gweithio ar un ystafell.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.940
Felly roedd yn gwybod y proses yw'r holl?

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.940
Yr hyn sy'n gwybod y pethau'n bwysig.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.940
Mae'r dydyn ni'n cael ei gweithio ar...

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.940
Yr un peth y dydyn ni'n gwybod yn fwy o'r...

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.940
Os ydych yn gwneud sox yn dda, nid yw?

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.940
Nid, nid, nid.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.940
Mae'n gweithio ar y pethau'n dda?

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.940
Mae'n dda iawn o ran y byddwn yn...

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.940
Rydw i wedi ymwneud yn y sox, oeddwn i'n gwneud y pethau'n dda.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.940
A yna...

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.940
Yn ôl, y dydd wedi dod yn ôl y pethau'n dda,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.940
mae'r ddyn Mr Jones'n yno,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.940

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.160
Nid.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.160
A oes genedlaeth chi'n gweithio'r uniformau

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.160

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.160
Roedd nhw'n dod yn y ddau.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.160
Roedd nhw'n dod yn y ddau.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.160
Ie.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.160
Yr unig peth yw,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.160
roedd gennych ni ddau.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.160
Felly,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.160
well, mae gennym nifer yma

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.160
ac roedd gennym i ddau'r ddau,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.160
ond maen nhw ddim yn gweithio'r ddau.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.160
Maen nhw'n dweud, roedden nhw'n cael ei chyfrifio.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.160
Why is that then?

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.160
I don't know.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.160
Does it dust maybe or something?

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.160
No, no.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.160
But now things have changed.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.160
You make socks and clothes for women now as well, don't you?

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.160
Oh yes, yes.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.160
And children.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.160
Were you allowed holidays?

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.160
Were you allowed so much time holidays?

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.160
Were there rules about that?

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.160
We used to have

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.160
when the colliery closed.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.160
You know, when they had a fortnight

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.160
and they shut down, we used to have

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.160
then.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.160
Stopped fortnights? Stopped fortnights.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.160
And when was that? Was it the same time every year?

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.160
Every year.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.160
I think it was last week in July and first week in August,

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.160
I think.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.160
Were you allowed to go on holidays in the early years?

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.160
Well, my first holiday was

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.160
Oxwich.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.160
Isn't it? Camping.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.160
And then I went to the Elamann.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.160
Did you go with the women

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.160
from the factory or not?

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.160
No, my friends. With my friends.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.160
That was it.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.160
Did you have any other days off then, like Christmas or?

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.160
Yes, we had. I can't remember.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.160
About a fortnight,

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.160
I think, Christmas.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.160
Like we've got now.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.160
So the factory would close then

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.160
for that time? Yes, yes.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.160
Easter? Easter.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.160
Bank holiday?

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.160
Bank holiday. All the bank holidays.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.160
You missed one though in August

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.160
because it was the beginning of August

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.160
and it was in your holidays, wasn't it?

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.160
Well, no, the 31st

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.160
is the bank holiday, isn't it?

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.160
But in the early years, it was in August

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.160
the beginning of August, wasn't it, I think?

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.160
The fort? Was it?

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.160
I don't know, anyway.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.160
I can't remember.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.160
I can't remember that.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.160
But you were paid for those holidays? Yes.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.160
OK. Yes.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.160
We used to have, well,

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.160
Mr Jones then, his father,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.160
his brother worked here as well

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.160
and his son

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.160
worked here, he was

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.160
a cousin, and

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.160
he used to have savings.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.160
You know, they used to take money out of LP.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.160
So that we had

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.160
quite a bit of money for the holidays.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.160
Oh.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.160
We used to do like a savings, you know.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.160
Savings account, is it? Account, yeah, yeah.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.160
Gosh, you don't remember how much that was?

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.160
A week or so much a week or?

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.160
I can't remember how much

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.160
they used to take out now.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.160
Did you have

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.160
a good relationship with the boss?

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.160
Oh, yes, Mr Jones.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.160
He was strict but you aren't straight, you know,

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.160
but I liked him.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.160
Did he come around? Did he know you?

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.160
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.160
So what would you call him, Mr Jones?

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.160
What did he call you? Margaret.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.160
Oh, Mr Jones.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.160
So how old were you when you got married now then?

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.160
Twenty-five. And your husband,

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.160
what did he do? He was a carpenter.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.160
OK. And so did you

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.160
leave the factory when you got married or just

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.160
carried on? No, no, I carried on.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.160
I worked three years

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.160
and I was a little boy.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.160
What happened then?

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.160
Did you have to leave then?

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.160
No, I had a machine home.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.160
I took a machine home and

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.160
So you worked from home then?

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.160
Yes.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.160
How long did that go on for?

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.160
Till he started school.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.160
And then I had a little girl

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.160
and then it all started all over again.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.160
So in that period

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.160
you were working from home?

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.160
Yes, yes, for the factory.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.160
They were happy to do that.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.160
Oh, yes, most of us, yes.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.160
Were there quite a few other women doing that?

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.160
Oh, yes, quite a few.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.160
So how did that work? Did they bring the work out to you?

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.160
Yes, if, you know,

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.160
or we'd come down

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.160
to see if

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.160
what they wanted.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.160
So you'd collect something from here?

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.160
Collect something. Did you have to produce a certain amount then

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.160
or was it just what you could?

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.160
What we could do, like, you know.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.160
As I say, it was paid for what you did.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.160
That was quite a good system, was it?

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.160
Yes, yes.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.160
Well, it's as handy.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.160
We didn't have babysitters, well I didn't.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.160
So you were able to keep up as well

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.160
with your craft into as well?

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.160
Yes, yes.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.160
Okay, good.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.160
And when did you come back then full time?

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.160
Once my daughter started full time.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.160
I did part time then.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.160
Nineteen, three, four, five years.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.160
And then I went to work

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.160
then nine till three.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.160
So did they have shift work here at all?

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.160
No.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.160
Or was it all the same?

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.160
No, they did, I didn't do the shift work.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.160
But how long it went on for, I don't know.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.160
That was on the next day.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.160
Was that, there wasn't night shift at all?

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.160
No, no, no.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.160
Just afternoons.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.160
Okay, so you came back for part time

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.160
while the children were in school really?

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.160
Yes, yes.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.160
And there were others then working on till five or half past five?

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.160
Yes, till twenty past five.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.160
Okay, good.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.160
Was there a shop associated with the factory

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.160
from the beginning?

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.160
Did you have any perks from working here at all?

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.160
Were you allowed to buy socks here?

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.160
Yes, yes, we could.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.160
There wasn't a shop

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.160
but whatever,

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.160
we could see.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.160
We used to go and ask one of the girls,

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.160
they used to keep them in boxes,

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.160
out in the factory.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.160
And if we wanted something, we'd go and ask.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.160
You could buy so little, so seconds.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.160
Yes, yes, seconds mostly.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.160
Wasn't there anything in some factories,

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.160
some girls used to pinfer some things?

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.160
Was that a problem here at all?

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.160
Once I think,

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.160
somebody's pay packet.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.160
But I think they knew who had done it.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.160
And I remember the misters

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.160
saying,

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.160
if you're short of money,

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.160
you come to ask me.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.160
You don't pinch off me.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.160
If you want something, I'll help you.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.160
But the girls didn't use to take some socks home?

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.160
No, no.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.160
No tradition of anything like that.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.160
Not that I know of.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.160
I think there is in some factories.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.160
You talked about the holidays now.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.160
Before you went on holidays,

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.160
did you have a good time the day before?

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.160
Was that a celebration that you weren't going to go?

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.160
No.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.160
You didn't like to have a bit of a jamboree before holidays?

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.160
No.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.160
What about before Christmas?

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.160
Once we finished work, we used to go then out.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.160
From work.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.160
They didn't decorate the factory, did they?

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.160
Yes.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.160
We used to all decorate.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.160
All trimmings hanging from...

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.160
You can't do it now.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.160
Because of the electric and things, isn't it?

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.160
From the lights, we used to have

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.160
trimmings everywhere. Christmas tree.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.160
Nothing else.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.160
Did you bring wine bottles in or bottles of drink at all?

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.160
Yes.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.160
I forgot about this.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.160
If it was cold, yes.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.160
We used to bring some whisky in.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.160
Because it was so cold.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.160
We used to have a break.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.160
We used to have a cup of whisky and tea.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.160
So that would warm us up to come out.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.160
We used to have a cup of tea.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.160
During any working day, it was very cold in winter?

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.160
Yes, very cold.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.160
Sometimes we had some quite heavy snows, didn't we?

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.160
Yes.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.160
The bosses did, no mind.

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.160
The bosses didn't.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.160
My snow is...

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.160
Am I supposed to say?

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.160
Yes, it's alright. Don't worry.

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.160
You won't have a sack.

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.160
I don't think so.

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.160
No.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.160
I don't think they'll sack me now.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.160
On a Friday,

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.160
if...

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.160
Just holiday time, like Christmas,

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:46.160
some of the girls used to do their own brew.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.160
We'd start at 10 o'clock in the morning then.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.160
By the time we were finished then.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.160
This was before Christmas, is it?

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.160
The Friday before Christmas.

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.160
You had a party, you said.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.160
Did you go out as a group then for a party?

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.160
Yes.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.160
Or they used to run trips.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.160
You know, to have a luncheon.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.160
Did you go on trips otherwise at all?

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.160
You know, like sort of to visit places at all?

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.160
No, we used to go strawberry picking on a Saturday with the children.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.160
They used to have a put a bus on and we used to go to Herriferd.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.160
Alright.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.160
Any other trips at all, do you remember?

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.160
I know before I came here, they used to go to Ilfracwm and all those places.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.160
But I didn't, you know, I hadn't started yet then.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.160
Was there a social club associated with the factory at all?

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.160
No.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.160
So there wasn't, there's no facilities like table tennis or anything like that?

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.160
No.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:50.160
How many women would you say were working here when there was most, you know, at its busiest of all?

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.160
100.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.160
How many are here now?

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.160
60 something.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.160
Right, so it went down for a period, did it?

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.160
Yes, yes.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.160
So how many women were working at one time?

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.160
Well, on the sock side of it.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.160
The hand socks, you know, the old ones.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.160
There's only two girls working on them now out of 100.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.160
And they're still wool, aren't they?

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.160
Yes, they're so expensive.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.160
They're high end, aren't they?

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.160
Very, very expensive.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.160
Hot socks and things, they still buy them.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.160
But they're a lot of money.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.160
Did you have a party for the children at Christmas time?

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.160
Was that organised as part of the...

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.160
No, no, we didn't have any parties for the children.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.160
Okay.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.160
So have any of the family followed you in the tradition here of working here at all?

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.160
No.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.160
No.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.160
How did you see your wage, you know?

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:48.160
Did you think of it as, when you were married now, did you think of it as the main wage earner or were you extra money in the family?

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.160
Extra money, extra money for me.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.160
So what did you spend your money on when you had the children?

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.160
Well, we bought the house, so we were saving to do it up and we were able to do it.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.160
We were saving to do it up and, you know.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.160
So really on domestic things.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.160
Yes, it just went.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.160
To improve quality of life really.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.160
Right, okay, fine.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.160
Okay.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.160
Right.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.160
You were talking about the toilets and going to the toilet here.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.160
What were the facilities like in the early years?

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.160
Were they clean and tidy?

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.160
Oh, they were clean but they were very old fashioned.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.160
Was there somebody coming in to clean?

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.160
Yes, yes, we had a cleaner.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.160
And the factory itself as well?

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.160
Yes, that was kept clean.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.160
Used to polish the floor.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.160
Were you allowed to smoke when you were working?

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.160
Oh no, no.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.160
I was smoking.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.160
If you wanted to smoke, I don't know if you smoke at all.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.160
No, I don't smoke.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.160
They used to go to the toilet to smoke.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.160
So that's why you were watching that they didn't stay in long, is it?

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.160
More than likely.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.160
And now they've got to go outside, have they?

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.160
Got to go outside now.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.160
Okay, that's changed as well, hasn't it?

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.160
Yes.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:02.160
In this factory, as workers, you were treated fairly?

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.160
Where Mr. Jones was here, yes.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.160
Okay.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.160
All right.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.160
Did you sort of look up to the foreman?

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.160
Was he sort of special?

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.160
Or were you just aware that you were terrified?

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.160
We were terrified of him.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.160
Was that because he was very strict and smiling?

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.160
I got on all right with him.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.160
I got on with my work.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:46.160
But he used to come around on a Friday then with a bag for sweets.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.160
He used to go round us all.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.160
He didn't give you sweets?

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.160
No, he wanted sweets.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.160
He wanted sweets?

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:58.160
Yes, but as I say, I got on all right with him.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.160
If somebody didn't do their work properly, what would happen then?

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.160
Mr. Jones would have them in the office to tell them.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.160
Do you remember any people being sacked?

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.160
No.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.160
A lot of them were older than myself.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.160
One of the younger ones was working here?

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.160
Yes, one or two of us.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:26.160
Were there somebody else who started the same time as you?

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.160
Yes, two of us I think started.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.160
Did you both stay on then for a long time?

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.160
No, I don't think the other girl did.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:46.160
When you started here, there were very few men working here you said.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.160
Has that changed in the time you've been here?

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.160
Oh yes, quite a lot.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.160
What is the ratio now about how many men are women?

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.160
Just an idea.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:04.160
I think there's about 10 or 11 working here.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:08.160
Are they treated? Are they teased? How are they treated?

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.160
They're in another part of the factory.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.160
We have got three out here at the moment but they're pressing.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.160
They're on their own over there.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.160
There's no sort of teasing?

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.160
Oh yes, there's a bit of teasing.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.160
There's a young, well he's not young, he's a disabled chap.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.160
He came from Remfoi.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.160
He's been here a few months now.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:36.160
Oh yes, the boys are teased.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.160
What way then?

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.160
I don't tease them.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.160
They're the youngsters, the young girls out there now, isn't they?

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:50.160
What do they say? Can you give an example?

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.160
No, I don't hear it because I know they're being teased.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.160
You can hear them laughing.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.160
I'm over this side, sir.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.160
What about the language on the factory floor?

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:06.160
Was there some quite, you know, because in some factories there were many who was quite rough language at times.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.160
Oh no.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.160
Would you say not at all here?

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.160
Oh one or two, if something's gone really wrong, but very rare.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.160
Was Welsh, were there Welsh speakers here?

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.160
There is Welsh speakers, yes.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.160
And they could speak Welsh, no problem?

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.160
No, yes, you know.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.160
I understand Welsh.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.160
I don't speak Welsh but I understand it.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.160
And I answer them in English if they speak Welsh.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.160
So there's no problem with speaking Welsh and not talking?

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.160
No.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:52.160
If you look back now, if you can think back over the years you've worked here,

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:58.160
what would you say are the things that stay in your memory, you know, when you look back?

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:08.160
I think it was just the company and, you know, we used to have such fun, you know, and everybody helped each other in those days, you know.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.160
If somebody was getting married, did you give presents to them?

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.160
Oh yes, they do that now.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.160
Was that a collection?

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.160
We have a collection and, you know.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:22.160
There's no tradition of them having to come into the factory in their wedding clothes, anything like that?

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.160
Oh, we used to dress them up.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.160
We used to dress them up.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.160
Tell us about that now then.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.160
You know, same thing.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.160
Just before getting married, isn't it?

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.160
Getting married, put a veil on them and dress them up in the wool.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:43.160
Or they used to sew up their coats, you know, but they couldn't put their arms in.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.160
They were sewn up.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.160
Well, the factory buses used to be outside.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.160
Well, of course, we all had to run.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:58.160
Well, I didn't, but the girls had to run because they used to just jump on and the buses used to go.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.160
It wouldn't wait for anybody.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:05.160
Of course, they were trying to get their sleeves, hands into the sleeves, but they couldn't.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:08.160
So they were all dressed, make-up on.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.160
And what did they do to them?

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.160
Dress them in what then?

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.160
In a veil and same thing, tie wool.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.160
Wool was everything then because, you know.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160
That's what you had, isn't it?

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.160
That's what we had, you know.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:23.160
Did they have to do anything in the factory, you know, like mop up or?

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.160
No.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.160
No, you didn't do anything after that?

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.160
No, no, no.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.160
No, we had to tidy up after us anyway.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.160
So you sewed the sleeves and the coats itself or just the sleeves?

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.160
No, just the sleeves.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.160
Did they know to expect this?

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.160
Well, in the end they did, but no, what else?

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:45.160
They had factory buses then, you said there?

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.160
Yes, double-decker buses waiting outside.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.160
Was that for all the factories?

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.160
Well, there was Pullmans.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.160
There was a big factory, Pullmans, Tenderton and Coggy.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.160
Because they used to come from the valleys.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.160
So what valleys were they then?

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:03.160
Tygwaith, Bryn Amann.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.160
Right, they came down here from the whole of Amann Valley then?

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.160
Oh, yes, yes.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:12.160
Did you notice there were differences between different people who came from the different areas?

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.160
No, not really.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.160
Everybody joined in, we still had some fun.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.160
There wasn't a lot really.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.160
Not in Coggy anyway.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.160
So these buses would serve the whole factory?

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.160
Yes, yes.

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:30.160
What about down towards, you know, Carmarthen?

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.160
Pen-y-Gros.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.160
I'm not sure about Crossharns.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.160
Can't think of anywhere else.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:41.160
We've got Joyce now, she's retired but she's come back to help us.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.160
She's from Tygwaith.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:48.160
And then we've got Laura, she's from Bryn Amann.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:55.160
It's very important really for the whole community, isn't it, for these factories?

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.160
Yes, yes.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.160
So when you look back then it's a sort of camaraderie with the girls that you remember, is it?

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.160
Yes.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.160
Was the wage important as well?

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.160
Well.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.160
Did that go up, do you remember?

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:11.160
Yes, when I got married I was earning £12.60 an hour.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.160
A week, sorry.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.160
£12.60 I was having a week.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:20.160
And then, do you remember what it went up to then after that?

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:24.160
Well, crept up a bit, it's not that big now mind you.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.160
Minimal wage we're having now, some of us.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.160
What about when you were working at home?

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.160
Do you remember how much that would have brought up?

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.160
No, I can't.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.160
That would have been quite difficult.

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.160
I suppose it varied.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.160
It varied, yes.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.160
It depends if the children were behaving.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:47.160
But I've got to say they are very good, even Mr Jones.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:54.160
If anything went wrong with your family, you could go home and, you know.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.160
So if you wanted time off for something like a funeral or something.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.160
Yes.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.160
Would that be all right?

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.160
Yes, yes.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.160
You can make up your hours.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.160
If you want to make up your hours, it's up to you.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.160
But when my husband died, they were marvellous, you know.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.160
So if somebody retired then, did they have a due for that?

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.160
Oh yes, we've had a due.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.160
We're having a due now at the end of this month.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.160
And were they given a gift of any kind by the...

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.160
Have you had a gift? You've worked here so many years.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.160
No?

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.160
Not as gold watch for all these years of service?

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.160
No, no.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.160
Might have a pullover perhaps.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.160
And do they give something to somebody who's retiring?

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.160
Yes, a pullover or whatever.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.160
A pullover?

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:47.160
A cardigan or a throw for a belt which Mary had.

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.160
She's just had it, Mary.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:53.160
One of the girls that was in school with me.

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.160
Right.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.160
The girls on the floor collect.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.160
You know, from my sixtieth they give me money towards...

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.160
A ring.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.160
Well, they give me money and said,

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.160
you can do what you like with it.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.160
So all my family, I didn't need anything.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.160
So they give me money.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.160
So I put everything in to having a ring like, you know.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.160
But the company itself doesn't give anything for so many years of service?

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.160
No, a bunch of flowers they had.

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.160
Right.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.160
OK.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.160
Do you know the women who've left then?

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.160
Do they keep in touch as a sort of like a club that they meet?

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.160
Well, yeah, no.

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.160
Or do you meet up with people who've left?

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.160
Because you've been here so long.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.160
Yeah, we've got this due now, September the end of the month.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.160
Christopher's paying for us to go to have an Indian.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.160
Right.

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.160
So Joyce has come in, the one has come back to help.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.160
And Mary now I'll give her a ring.

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.160
She used to be supervisor down the other end.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.160
She'll come and meet us.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.160
So there'll be a group of how many of you then?

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.160
Well, whoever wants to come from the factory.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.160
Right, OK.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.160
So did they used to pay in the old days for the Christmas party you went out on?

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.160
Yes.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.160
They did?

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.160
Yeah.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.160
OK.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.160
Fine.

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.160
We have a Christmas party now, mind.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.160
And they pay for everything, the drinks and the food.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.160
So is that a dinner somewhere?

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.160
A dinner, yes.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.160
No, just in there.

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.160
You know, when you were talking about the singing here,

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.160
was that to help you with the work or was it just to enjoy?

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.160
To enjoy, I think, you know.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.160
Yeah.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.160
Do you still sing here?

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.160
Nothing.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.160
No.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.160
We're not allowed radios.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:44.160
Well, we are, but the radio company, they need £1,000 a year.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.160
You know, like you pay for your television.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.160
So you had a record player playing then?

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.160
Yes.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.160
And so you bought it?

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:59.160
We used to have a wine list until they said that we've got to pay £1,000 a year for the company to...

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.160
License it.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.160
Yeah, a licence for us to...

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.160
Gosh.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.160
So the girls have got earphones now and...

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.160
They've got a little home for the person.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.160
They've got a little home for the person.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.160
So nobody talks now and they just listen to the...

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.160
I can't stand it, mind, all the time.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:21.160
When the music is playing, you'd have records that you enjoyed then,

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.160
and you could choose your own records.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.160
Did you choose a record at all?

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:35.160
Yes, we all used to pool in, but one person every week used to have a choice on the record.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.160
Which ones did you like?

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.160
I liked Cliff Richards, I did.

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:46.160
Right. If you had to go back again though, would you choose to come back to work in the factory?

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.160
Yes, I've enjoyed myself here, I've got to say.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:54.160
And there's been no break, except when you left out the children,

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:58.160
there's been no time when the factory's closed down or anything like that?

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.160
No, no, no.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.160
Employment has been constant?

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.160
Yes, constant.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.160
They've been into liquidation once or twice,

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:14.160
but we've worked until a founder by her came in and then called her back.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:20.160
I believe there's been some royal family interest here as well.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.160
Oh yes, yes.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.160
Do you remember their visit at all?

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:27.160
Oh yes, Princess Anne. She was very nice, she was.

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:31.160
When did she come? Do you remember how many years ago that was?

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:36.160
They've been, because there's been asbestos, yeah?

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.160
They've thrown a lot of stuff.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.160
I can't say enough.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:49.160
This lady here, Pam, I used to work with her, she went all straight to America.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.160
Ah, right.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.160
She's dead now.

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:57.160
So, Princess Anne came, did you have to demonstrate anything to her?

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.160
Were you demonstrating?

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.160
Yeah, they opened a new factory here.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.160
So she came to open it.

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:11.160
And anyone else at all? Any other royal family visitor?

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:19.160
Prince Charles. When he goes to Muddfey, he comes, falls here sometimes.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.160
I think he wears your socks, I think, does he?

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.160
Yes, and I've downed his socks.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.160
Did you do any downing then, you know?

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.160
Yeah, he's got hunting socks.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.160
Sorry?

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.160
He's got hunting socks.

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.160
Are they made here?

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:36.160
No, but he has sent them here for us to repair for him.

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:40.160
We would have a shock.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.160
Did you do that anyway? Did you do any downing anyway?

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.160
I do all repairs.

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.160
What do you mean by repairs now?

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.160
Well, if companies send something back.

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.160
All right.

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.160
You know, I...

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:55.160
So, on the machine or by hand?

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:59.160
No, by hand. I sit down. I haven't got a machine job or anything.

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:05.160
I just fix, you know, how can I say if there's a... sometimes...

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.160
Something you said. Obviously, that work has changed in the time you've been here,

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:25.160
but you said you also worked as a sort of teacher or instructor as well.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.160
Yes, yes, on the knitting.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:29.160
And what did you do there?

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.160
You just told the young girls sat with them and...

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.160
No, we have to stand up because the machines are quite big.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.160
I don't know if you...

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.160
No, but is your work standing or sitting?

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.160
Sitting now, but it used to be standing.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.160
All day?

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:48.160
All day. The girls stand all day on the knitting.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.160
And is that what you had to do when you were doing the socks?

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:55.160
No, not the socks sitting down, but the knitting, you stand up.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.160
This is the knitwear then?

00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.160
Yes, yes, chunky.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.160
That can be quite tiring then, can't it?

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.160
Yes, it's hard going.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.160
So, if you were doing... when did the sort of knitwear come in?

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.160
Do you have any idea what time that was?

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.160
No, no, when did it...

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:14.160
All right. So, when did you start doing the knitwear then?

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.160
Let's get that down on the tape.

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.160
1960.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:21.160
OK. And that was completely different...

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.160
To the socks.

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.160
Yes. How did you learn to do that?

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.160
Hew.

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.160
He taught you and set, did he?

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.160
Yes, yes.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:32.160
And what were you doing at the beginning? Was it...

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.160
Socks, knitted socks.

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.160
Yes, so what were you doing with the knitwear at the beginning? Was it jumpers?

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.160
No, no, socks.

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.160
The socks were flat.

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.160
And then...

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.160
I haven't got one yet to show you.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.160
They used to then...

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.160
They used to bring them forward.

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.160
They used to pick them up on the sock machine.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.160
After we'd done the leg.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:54:00.160
And then they used to bring them around and link them up.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.160
At the back.

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.160
So, quite a few different techniques.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.160
Yes, yes.

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.160
So, you were talking then about what you call it when there's different gauges.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.160
What are they that you use here?

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.160
The different...

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.160
Is it gauges?

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.160
Yes, there's fine gauge and there's heavy gauge.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.160
And which ones did you do the socks in?

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.160
Whatever.

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.160
Ah, right. Could be either.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.160
Could be either, yes.

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:32.160
Right, okay. So, to sum up, is there anything I've left out now that you want to tell me about the history of the factory or the stories that you want to say?

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.160
I think you've said all the naughty things.

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.160
So, okay. Well, thank you very much.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.160
We'll draw it to an end.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.160
A'i o.
