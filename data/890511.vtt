00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
But I love it. I've been here 56 years now.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.240
56.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.240
Same as me.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.240
Same as us.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.240
I love it.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.240
I wouldn't move from here though.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.240
Oh no.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.240
No I wouldn't.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.240
I love badness.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.240
I love badness.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.240
And when I hear people saying about badness.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.240
Oh I got that.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.240
And I get it.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.240
It's such a bad thing.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.240
I get it.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.240
Well it's better than duck rig.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.240
Well when I'm black.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.240
Yes.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.240
Everyone got their bat and couldn't.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.240
Yes.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.240
In lonely states.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.240
You shouldn't do that.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.240
You shouldn't run anything down.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.240
Well when I was young.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.240
In the spa room.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.480
In the spa on Malpers Road.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.480
There was people at work there.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.480
They came from Bettys.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.480
And if you heard them.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.480
You'd never think they came from Bettys.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.480
No.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.480
Oh everything is bad about Bettys.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.480
I know.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.480
And if you want.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.480
I say hang on a minute.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.480
Hang on.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.480
I do.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.480
Stand on the lane.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.480
And watch the children.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.480
The majority of them go at Malpers.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.480
That's what I say.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.480
So don't come here saying about Bettys.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.480
I won't have it.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.480
No.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.480
I don't want to have it.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.480
Well they got bad and good everywhere.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480
That's right.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.720
The hedgepats.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.720
The posh parts.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.720
Everyone.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.720
You shouldn't do that.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.720
No.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.720
You've got your good and your bad everywhere.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720
Don't care what they say.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.720
That's it.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.720
Yeah.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.220
Anyway.
