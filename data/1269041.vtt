Love is a very splendid thing, It's the April rose that only blooms in the early spring.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Love is which is way of giving, A reason to be living, That holy crown that brings the man of King,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The man on a high and with him, With the holy twist to love as this, And the world to see.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:11.000
When your fingers touch my silent heart, And thought enough to sing, Yes, true love is a very splendid thing.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:35.000
There is the rain wind and the Spanish hail, The shouts and the dances and the old shot's bale,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:54.000
The sweet breeze and the swaying the scale Of the Spanish rain will blow here.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And on white bed the highlights and the yellow moon, And in the cozy office the sleepy tune, And the quiet voice calling in,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:47.000
The long long runes of the Spanish rain will blow here.

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:56.580
to be a friend to the brave heart.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.580
I'll come on my knees after all,

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:08.580
to be a friend to the brave heart.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:14.580
I'll come on my knees after all,

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:19.580
to be a friend to the brave heart.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:25.580
I'll come on my knees after all,

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:31.580
to be a friend to the brave heart.

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:42.580
I'll come on my knees after all,

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.580
to be a friend to the brave heart.

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:58.580
those are the words of��라고요

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:09.580
I part for you with a line of engraving,

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.580
so that the dawn will come again,

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:21.580
A dear and kind family,

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:28.580
Our grandest boons are true.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:34.580
Our Lord, dear one, the wayward,

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:41.580
Very dear to our hearts.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:48.580
A dear and kind family,

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:54.580
Our grandest boons are true.

00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:03.580
For the whole world, for the whole world,

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:09.580
For the whole world, for the whole world,

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:15.580
But if it is a deadly thing,

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:22.580
Who will we find the truth?

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:29.580
Our Lord, dear one, the wayward,

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:35.580
Very dear to our hearts.

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:46.580
My love you'll be, and love you'll be,

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:52.580
O rising of the world beyond,

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:58.580
Growing chariots here, where death will be,

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:05.580
And rising up above the ground.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:11.580
Our Lord, dear one, the wayward,

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:18.580
Very dear to our hearts.

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:26.580
O rising of the world beyond,

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:33.580
Where death will be,

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:50.580
And rising up above the ground.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:11.580
My Lord, and me, and with me, Lord,

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:19.580
He sent me the devil.

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:27.580
And in that voice he vices the grave,

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:34.580
With honor, glory, and air,

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:41.580
For I feel his will.

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:49.580
The voice of glory and love,

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:57.580
The glory and air.

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:05.580
For I feel his will.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:13.580
The voice of glory and love,

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:22.580
The glory and air.

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:27.580
Scene 3

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:38.580
Love and wird conjugate

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:47.580
Love andteok, I give the fully load

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:53.580
I see, looks, how I love and envy thee,

00:49:53.580 --> 00:50:03.580
Because you're mine, because you're mine,

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:07.580
Because you're mine,

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:12.580
The breeze that carries my deep heart of melody,

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:19.580
And why, because you're mine,

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:25.580
Because you're mine,

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:33.580
I only know for as long as I live,

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:39.580
I'll only wait for the kiss that you alone

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:45.580
May give me,

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:50.580
And when we kiss,

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.580
That isn't unbelievable,

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:57.580
It's only my heart you hear,

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.580
And it's the bruised,

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:11.580
We have you mine.

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.580
When I was a bachelor I lived all alone,

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.580
And worked and to weave I strayed,

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:34.580
And the only, only thing that I did that was roam

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.580
Was to do a fey and gay,

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:41.580
I'd put her in the wintertime,

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:45.580
And in the summer too,

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:50.580
And the only, only thing that I ever did roam

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:53.580
Was to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew,

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:59.580
One night she came to my bedside,

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:02.580
And I lay fast asleep,

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:06.580
She laid her head upon my bed,

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:09.580
And she began to weep,

00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:14.580
This night she cried, she tarnished I,

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:17.580
She said, what can I do?

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:21.580
I only knew to learn to write,

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.580
To cover up the hand,

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:26.580
Just to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew,

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:32.580
Now I am a bachelor and I live with my son,

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:37.580
And we worked and to weave I strayed,

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:41.580
And every single time that I look into his eyes,

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:44.580
He reminds me of that fey and gay,

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:49.580
He reminds me of the wintertime,

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:52.580
And of the summer too,

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:59.580
And of the many, many times I took her in my arms,

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:04.580
As to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew,

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:35.580
Without a song the road would never end,

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:42.580
Without a song the day would never end,

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:45.580
When things go on,

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:49.580
I'm marrying from a friend,

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:54.580
Without a song,

00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:04.580
That field of gold would never steal now,

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:11.580
That field of gold would be at best now,

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:15.580
A man is born,

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:19.580
And he's no good no how,

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:24.580
Without a song,

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:29.580
I've got my trouble and woe,

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:35.580
But sure as I do, there's more than one,

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.580
I've been alone,

00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:47.580
As long as the song is sung in my town,

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:55.580
I'll never know what makes that rain fall,

00:54:55.580 --> 00:55:03.580
I'll never know what makes that grass so tall,

00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:12.580
I only know there is no love at all,

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:16.580
Without a song,

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:35.580
I only know there is no love at all,

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:44.580
Without a song,

00:55:46.580 --> 00:56:07.580
I am free of the mountains of my own,

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:14.580
Of the mountains where in sky I would grow,

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:20.580
I have wealthy summer skies,

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:25.580
Where the summer never lies,

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:33.580
But my heart is in the mountains of my own,

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:48.580
I can see the blue forest gate of the hill,

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:56.580
I can hear the magic logic of the wind,

00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:07.580
There is nothing to compare with the love that once was there,

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:15.580
In that groovy little house by the hill,

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:32.580
I can see the little church what down below,

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:40.580
Where the mountain ridges one word, hope and hope,

00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:47.580
And when all my soul shall be,

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:54.580
It is there my home to sleep,

00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:59.580
Where those heroes go,

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:11.580
And my dreams come true.

00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:28.580
Coral

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:09.440
Awaken, my holy people.

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:20.120
From theAgata, spotless,

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:24.700

Heidi D προ filbar,

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.980
Hmmm,

He will live, he will abide,

00:59:53.980 --> 01:00:00.980
Alive, he will be alive,

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:07.980
Alive!
