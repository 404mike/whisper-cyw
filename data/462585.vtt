00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
In the 1950s, television was only on in short bursts.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:13.920
You literally got a children's hour at five o'clock, followed by the news,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:27.120
and then television service resumed again. It must have closed down at half past six,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:35.200
and then resumed again around about eight o'clock and went through till ten,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.920
or perhaps eleven, because I can remember the epilogue man, known among school friends as the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:58.800
epilogue man, who was at one stage was one of the, it was, they had a list of people who did it,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.640
and we would watch the Padre and then we'd compare the Padre with the Methodi Mound and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.400
the Anglican Priest and so on.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.640
When we moved, when my family moved out of London, which was in 1956,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:37.760
so, and then we moved up to North Wales, actually higher up the mountain than here,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:51.120
up in Gwynfyn village. We didn't have television for about two years,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.480
and then I can remember going to a friend's home to watch, of all things, the Beverly Sisters,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.760
and then, and somebody else had television, and they were rather keen on Sergeant Bilko,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:20.560
which I didn't really understand. When we got television in our home again,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.200
when we got television in our home again, I remember sitting with my grandma,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:38.160
who was over on a visit from Leeds, and we watched a production of Bernard Shaw, Major Barbara,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.720
and the young woman heroine was Judi Dench, and my grandma said, she's good.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.680
We'll watch her, we'll watch out for her, and I still do.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.200
Grandma always also liked come dancing. Victor Sylvester.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.640
What did I watch? By then I was sort of at the leaving school age,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:26.400
school in Wrexham. It was differently orientated from my London school. My London school was

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:38.720
turning us out to be career women, and we were being told, assessed, helping our decisions for

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:46.400
which way we were going. Up here in Wrexham, we were much more being turned out to be good wives

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:57.840
and mothers, good housekeepers. So somehow the intellectual side of life wasn't brought forward

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:07.360
so much. Much better to be able to make a good Christmas cake or to be able to make a good

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:17.360
cake or to cut and sew your own clothes. And then when I left school,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:33.120
I was busy with a young life and we didn't watch TV. Not to make a thing about it.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:47.040
But in later years, after I was married and had a family, I watched TV. Ah!

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:59.120
My daughter fell into a category for the birthday trust, and when she was assessed at three and a

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:07.760
half, the lady doing the questionnaire asked me how much television my daughter watched.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:19.920
And I said, well, children don't watch a lot. And I told her what was watched. And she spent

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.560
three-quarters of an hour trying to trip my daughter up to find out if she watched more

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.520
television than that. Because she didn't believe you could just watch play school

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.920
and just watch part of the children's hour program. So I was always very selective.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.880
I also got indignant with the mothers who told me they were seeing the same Andy Pandy programs

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.440
over again with the third child. Because I'd watched those programs with my younger sister

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:59.280
in the 1950s. And I'm not quite sure how they coloured the film

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.840
for the later things. So yes, I've always been quite selective.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:21.360
And just at the moment, I don't actually have a television. Because about four years ago,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.880
I'd settled myself down on the sofa to watch Gardener's World and gone to sleep.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:37.520
And as that was one of the programs at Instagram, I was very, very, very, very,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.680
very, very, very, very excited. So then programs that instigated my husband and I getting a colour

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:58.480
television, I thought the programs had rather gone off. And so my licence was due within a few weeks.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.640
I wasn't having a television, I wasn't renewing my licence.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.480
And I haven't really missed it.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.480
Radio Times does a good job in keeping up with what's going on.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:19.480
Have you got any experience of watching television with a lot of other people or in a public place?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.480
Yes.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:39.480
These days I'm not without television altogether because I go to the gym and upstairs where the machines are, particularly the running machines, there's TV and you decide which one you want.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.480
So I look for a rugby match.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:56.480
Although the soccer and the cricket is quite good because you get to see the pictures and enjoy the game without the overpowering commentary.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:06.480
Of all the things you've seen on television, what's had the greatest impression on you?

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.480
Ooh.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:32.480
Obviously what we started with, the funeral of George VI, Michael Burke's Ethiopia,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:57.480
and possibly some of the natural dramas, volcanic tsunami.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:07.480
The power of what can happen that we as the human race have no control over.
