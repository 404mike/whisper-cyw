00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
During this period of time, obviously the community, the Jewish community in Newport

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.120
was beginning to decrease.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.080
People were going to London, the odd one to Israel, the odd one to Bournemouth and so

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.080
on and so forth.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.880
And we had a most wonderful minister there called Abraham Snaddle.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.200
And he did everything.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.240
My father thought he was lazy, even though he did everything.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.340
And he thought he was lazy because when it came to my bar mitzvah, I was quite capable

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.460
of doing a lot more for my bar mitzvah.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.100
But Snaddle said, that's enough, you know, that's enough, he can do this or that or

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.940
whatever and that's it.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.660
Anyway, the other interesting thing about those formative ears, because of my musical

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.740
background I had a very keen ear for music.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.620
I would pick things up just very quickly.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.340
And now, you know, in my dotage, my ear is even keener.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.300
It's amazing how it works, but it is very keen.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.020
I run a choir in Leeds at the moment, a men's choir in the synagogue.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.420
And I can hear when, you know, there's 15, 16 people there, I can hear when anybody's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.660
not doing what they should do.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.100
But during those formative years, regular attenders at the synagogue on Queen's Hill

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.380
Crescent and I learned many of the prayers.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.220
I learned Snaddle was a wonderful, not a lyrical tenor, he was more of a baritone bass.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.340
But he knew all the different tunes and you may not be aware, but a different, for a Shabbat,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.900
for example, there are certain tunes.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.660
For the High Holy Days, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, there are completely different tunes

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.180
for the same, essentially the same prayers.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.820
And for the other festivals, Passover, the Feast of Weeks and Sukkot, there's again a

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.660
different set of tunes.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.420
And these all kind of lodged in my brain and have stayed there forever, just stayed there

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.860
forever.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.420
So when I go to a synagogue somewhere else, I know what the right thing is to sing.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.980
And you know, I tell them afterwards, well, why did you sing that particular, because

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.140
that's not the traditional thing.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.900
And they're quite taken aback, because they actually don't know that they're not doing

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.140
the correct way of singing it.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.420
I mean, it's bullshit really, but you know, as long as the words are correct, it doesn't

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.420
really matter.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.020
But I was a regular attender, and by the time I was 10 or 11, I was actually taking some

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.700
of the services, even though I wasn't Bar Mitzvah.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.540
Anyway, following my Bar Mitzvah, I used to help with the services and everything else.
