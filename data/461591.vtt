00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What kind of emotions did watching Wales play evoke in you?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Oh, very much. Very much. Everybody in motion.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's an awful thing to say, I know.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But when you see France play England and France beat England,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
your emotions end. Anybody that beat England would be here with all of you.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But, er, very, er, yes. I really enjoyed the 70s rugby.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
How did you feel about the players then?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Oh, very good. And mine, they were amateur then.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I think since they turned professional, the rugby have changed.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But they were all respectful. They were all respected.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You know, you had Gareth Edwards, you had Barry John, you had Philip Bennett,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
you had Quinell and all. But every one of them that came along

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
was respected till they went north.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
When they went north, oh, God, didn't it?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They were everything but the man.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But, er, you know, that was my thoughts on them then.
