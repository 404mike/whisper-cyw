00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So the first question is if you'd like to tell me about your experience of coming to Wales.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It was very nice coming to Wales. I came from East Africa, direct to Wales.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Yeah, it was a seven-hours travel, two flights, changed in Amsterdam, then I got here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But I arrived in Wales very late, because there was a delay. I came in 2022 December.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So from 2022 December to date, I've been around.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So about a year and a half.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Yeah, a year and a half.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And what were your first impressions of Wales?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Oh, Wales is very cold. Oh my God, Wales is very cold.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I always feel like, come out of the house, it's warm, with no time, it's raining.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So the weather is unpredictable. But I like it because it's quiet. It's a quiet place here.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Wales is very quiet. It doesn't have too much activity like London compared to London.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So I like this kind of environment.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And over the year and a half that you've been here, have your impressions of living in Wales changed?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Like wanting to live in Wales?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Or just what it's like to live in Wales?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Yeah, of course. I came from abroad, and this was my first experience of leaving my home country to UK and Wales.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Definitely I'm trying to adjust to very many things, especially the dress code.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You have to put on a lot of things to cover yourself from cold.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:02.000
When I had just arrived, I froze. I was not told that I'm supposed to have a warm shoe on me and diaper clothes, stuff like that.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Our country is very warm. So these things of freezing on the street, I didn't have any clue.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I suffered. That day I had to go to the shop and I explained to the lady in the shop.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
She told me next time, don't come out of the house when you dress like this.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And that's how I started adjusting. And you know, if it is winter, you don't dress up like you in Africa.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Yes, you don't dress up like you in Africa. You have to really cover yourself nicely.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The cold can frustrate you. I couldn't lift my legs. It was that bad. I couldn't lift my legs.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
But this time, this year, I knew how to dress up. And I'm actually fine.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Do you have a favourite item of clothing that you would save for the day?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Yes, I have my favourite goods. My favourite trousers, my favourite jacket, my favourite cardigan.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Yeah, I put on my cardigan. I put on a jacket on top and a nice trouser.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Shoes that are covering my legs properly. Yeah, I think I'm now fine.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Now you've got your Welsh footwear.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Yes, yes, I've got it. But I learnt the hard way. It wasn't easy. I learnt the hard way.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So last year, it was around 5th. We were still staying at the seaside.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
That's where when I arrived in Wales, I went to work at the seaside.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We came out of the house. We went to the lodge where we used to stay.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
When we opened the door, oh my god, snow. First time we were seeing snow.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
We were like, goodness me. We just came out, stepped in the snow, took pictures.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
It was interesting. It was really fun.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
You say that's the first time you'd seen snow.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Yeah, first time to see snow in my life. Africa doesn't have snow. East Africa doesn't have snow.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So it was amazing. They took pictures, sent them home. It was fun.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And what was the reaction from them?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They were like, oh, she's experiencing the snow now. But this year, the snow has not appeared.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I think the weather has changed. I kept on waiting this time to go for it. Nothing.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Oh, fabulous. Thank you.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So you've talked about you came and you were at the seaside. Have you moved from the seaside now?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I moved from the seaside to the centre now.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So you've lived in a variety of places since you've been here.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I left the seaside. Now I'm at up here in town.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So does that give you a sense of having lived in a different, a series of different places in the last year and a half,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
do you have a place that feels home?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Of the three?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Or just what it is that makes it feel home?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Because it's shared accommodation and different cultures, different ways of doing things.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So to me, the three places, none of them has felt like home because the two were for workplace.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Then this one where I am currently, it's just a shared accommodation for working stroke students.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
But I'm not a student.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
When I'm living with students and it is six people, totally different.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
So when I'm in my room, that's it.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
When I come out, I have to go to a common bathroom. I go to a common kitchen.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
There's a way like looking at my things when I'm at home. It's totally different here.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
There are adults, you can't tell them do this.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
There's a time I was told to keep in my lens.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So I was like, OK, I think I have to slow down a bit.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Hygiene wise, I think I was looking at it, having the background that I told you all.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I was looking at hygiene, getting off my lens.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And I was like, guys, can you try to be adults and look neat?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Now I look at it the way it is.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I just pray that maybe before this year ends, I get a house which is one room.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I have my own bathroom. I have my own kitchen.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
That's when I feel like I'm home because I can do what I want there.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And do you have... So you've got your room, which you said feels OK?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Yeah, my room feels OK. But you see, my room is not complete.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
If I don't have where I can cook from, if I don't have my own shower,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I want to shower at a certain time. When you want to go and shower, you find a tochupai.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Then you have to postpone. Your brain is already set to go and shower.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Then you want to cook, you're hungry, go to the kitchen, you find the stove already full.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So my room doesn't... Just because there's a bed that I feel I'm comfortable with, that's it.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Yeah. So that's it with the home arrangement and accommodation.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
But home will be when you've got your own space.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
If I have my own space, I really, really would want it to be like home in the UK.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Yeah. I want to look at my dining, my kitchen, my everything. I want to look at it neat.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So I can't do it now. I only make my room neat, my bed neat, my room, and that's it. Yeah.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Yeah, that's a challenge, isn't it, Shad? It's a huge challenge.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
It's a big challenge because accommodation here is very, very difficult.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The nine months I spent, they would never afford to give us accommodation.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
They tell us, unless you're a student, you can get studio accommodation, you can get one room,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
unless you're a student, but I'm not a student.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Then I asked them, even those that have got offices that get people accommodation,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
you walk in there, they tell you, you have got property for students, yes,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
but those of you that are working, not in city.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So the priority here is for students because they are majority, actually.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
The universities have taken quite a lot of good accommodation.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I even told the landlady she has properties.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I told her, could you please get me one room house that has a sitting area?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I want to be like home. She said, no, it's not available.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
You just can't fit in the shared accommodation for now.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Yeah. Fingers crossed it comes through quickly. Yeah.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
It's one and a half years now.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
You know, you come from work.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
You want to be relaxed a bit, sit in the city, watch TV.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Where would you watch TV from?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
The common room, the common area, you can't put your TV there.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Some other person will come and break it.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
You do not know. It's so and so and so.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
In your room, it's a small room. It's not a big one.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You can't put all the things there.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
But anyway, slowly, like you said, fingers crossed.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
One day, one morning, I'll wake up and get the house.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Yeah, I'll get it.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I'm still having high hopes of getting that one that will make me feel like home.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Wales.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So if we think a little bit about any point in your life you want to focus on,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
so it doesn't just have to be the last year and a bit since you've been in Wales,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000
but anywhere, is there a place that's felt home to you?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Before I came to the UK, no, I'd never left my country.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I used to move within my country.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
But when I used to move within my country, doing whatever studies and so on,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I would get accommodation that would feel like home.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I would get accommodation that would feel like home because I was facilitated for that.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So they would know I'm coming.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000
They'd get me a place that I would be comfortable so that I'd do my work when I'm happy.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And thinking about, again, across your whole life,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
is there a place or a time that is very important to you?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So it might be a really happy memory or it might be a childhood memory

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.000
or it might be just a place that you've been that feels like somewhere you'd like to tell me about.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Maybe when I was doing the studies, there's a place where I went and I climbed a very steep hill near the equator.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The hill was too steep, but we didn't walk up the hill.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
We went up the hill with small bikes.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So there were expert people that rode us to that steep hill.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
You'd look down and you're like, my gosh, if I go off this bike and roll down, they'll never see me again.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So it was interesting.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And we went there for five days.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
The first day was terrifying.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The second day, but the fifth day, we were used.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Just sit on the bike, one and a half hours going uphill.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
It was interesting.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
What was the...

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So if you were to take me there, can you tell me what I would say if I was a bit on my own?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Yeah, if you were to go there, because our district, our home district, is a tourist attraction place.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
There are plenty of things to look at.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000
You'd really feel nice going uphill on a small bike, meandering around the hill.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And then you see yourself on the hilltop and you'd be like, he rode me all through here and he didn't trip off.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
It would be very nice. You'd really enjoy it.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
We get very many people that come from this side and come for holiday there.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
There are many things to look at. That would be one.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Then there would be another one where you go there.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Stones that drip like breasts.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Yeah.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
It's next to that place, that hilly place.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
It is still within the same vicinity.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
It would be very interesting for you.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So it's like a breast milk.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Yeah, like real boob of a woman.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
It comes out like real breast milk.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So we even call it breast of a certain woman.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
This was a historical woman.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So they say that these are when they were moving, they stopped there and they became like monuments.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
So people, very many tourists go there.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
It's like a cave you go in, but you find the breast, the milk like that stuff dripping.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It drips year in, year out.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
It's a tourist attraction.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
It's very nice.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
You'd love to take pictures, call others to come and look at it.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Yeah, that is it.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Yeah.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
It sounds wonderful.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
It's really nice. It's really nice.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I always tell people here, East Africa is a place to be.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And is there a time that you've been, have you been many times or once or?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
No, every time you go, if you want to, if when I'm home and I want to change environment,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
you actually can go there and sit.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
The trees are so refreshing.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
You just, people take tents there and camp there.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
You just go there.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
It's a home away from home.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Then you hear the birds singing on top of you in the trees.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
It's a really quiet place, nice place to stay.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Not the hilltop, but that other one where there are like breasts.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
What the colour's like?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
It's a tree. It's green. It's green.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
The colour of that one that drips is like a stone. It's brown.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
It's like a stone, but you really see it dripping like a breast of a mother.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Yeah.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Oh, it sounds wonderful.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Yeah, it's really interesting.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Would you like to tell me a bit about what your life was like growing up?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:20.000
When I was growing up, I at around five, I developed asthma.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
They first told, they first kept on saying I had bronchitis.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Then from bronchitis, they said asthma.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
It really disturbed me from five years up to 16.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Then I had to do it.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I had to leave my home district.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I came to the capital city.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And when I came to the capital city, the asthma checked out.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
They used to say you can take some local medicine.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
It will heal, but it didn't.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
But when I left the cold place and came to a warmer one, it went.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
You've come back to the cold and wet.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Yeah, but the cold one now, I completely healed.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Actually, my mum, because my dad does not exist anymore,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
my mum was worried. She was like, oh, you're now going to the UK, the winter.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I said no.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I'm no longer asthmatic. I outgrew it.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Yeah.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I outgrew it completely.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I had the same actually.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
I was asthmatic.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And then when I got pregnant, it went.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Yeah, you can outgrow it.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
You can outgrow it.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Some people don't believe that certain things happen, but it's true.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
It's possible.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I just changed.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Actually, it was the pediatrician who advised my parents then that this child, try this.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
We've given her plenty of meds.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
She's not responding.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Just remove her from this cold weather, take her to the capital city and see how she will be.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
As soon as I stepped in the city, the asthma checked out.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
That's a big move for you and your family, though.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Yeah. They brought me and kept me with my mum's sister.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
They remained there, but I stayed with my mum's sister.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And I didn't have asthma anymore.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Yeah.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
So that was it.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
So your mum and your mum's sister have been important people for you.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Yeah. Very important.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
My mum's sister, I call her mum.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I call her mum because from the time I was young, she was living with my mum.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
So when she got married, she came to the capital city.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
They were living in the capital city.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
My family remained back in our home district.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I came and lived with my mum.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
I call her mum, my young mum, my auntie.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
So she's really, really good.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
She's my friend.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And everybody knows she's my friend.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
So they've been a very, very, very strong rock to my growth.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And do you want to talk a little bit about that?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
You mentioned your studies a few times.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Would you like to tell us a bit?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
My studies? Yeah.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Actually, when I came to live with my auntie, she took me to the hospital.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
She went with me.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
She told me, come, let's go to the hospital together.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I think she was going for Auntie Nento.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
She was going for Auntie Nento, if I'm not forgetting.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Then when I reached there, I looked at the nurses.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Very smart.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:46.000
They were putting on a uniform that was white, red, and it was ironed with plates.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Very neat.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I told my auntie, I have to put on that uniform.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I like it.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
She was like, oh.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I said, no, I have to put on that uniform.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I like it.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
I want to become a nurse now because I like the uniform.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
That's how I became a nurse.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I actually went to that same school and I did the nursing.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I put on that uniform.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
I really used to iron it nicely.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
I would feel nice when I'm sitting.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I put all the plates together.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
No wrinkles.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
That's me.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
For three years, I did the general nursing.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
And then you specialized?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
No, I'm a general nurse.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Then after that, I started doing the studies.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I started doing the studies after that.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
But I'm a senior nurse.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Of general nursing, I did not specialize in anything, but the studies, we do them according to the seniority back home.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:57.000
If you're a senior of a certain level, you can do studies with the people who are current-night researchers.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Do you have a research specialism?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
I have certificates of participation and so on.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Is there a topic that you particularly loved working on?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
I worked basically on, like in my field.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
I never went out of my field.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
It was basically HIV.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Then I go to pediatrics.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Then, yeah, it was medical basically.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Yeah.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:40.000
But in the community, when I was doing my research, I would come across people who have got like domestic problems.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I was trained to do counseling.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
So I would do that also.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I would do counseling because that one also I specialized in it.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And is that something you do right?

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Very much.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
I do it even now.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Someone can be low, feeling really bad and so on.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:16.000
When I talk to that person, the person really feels, they still hope even after this, I still can make it.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Yeah.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I've spoken to many people who have challenges and they tell me, yeah, your conversation with me has impacted me.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
So I feel proud of that.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Yeah.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Really proud.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Yeah.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:41.000
That actually leads into a question that I have here, which is we talk a lot about magic moments.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
So a moment when something changed.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:56.000
So I don't know if there's a magic moment in your life you'd like to, you've obviously provided them lots for other people, but is there one that you would like to talk about?

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Something changed.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Something changed.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
When I came to Wales, I didn't have anybody I knew here.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
It was quite challenging.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:20.000
But through work place and church, there's a lady who told me, there's a lady from East Africa.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
I will get her contacts.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
You meet with her.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
She could be from your home district.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
To me, that was magic.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
She changed everything.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000
I was like, wow, I even have somebody who's from East Africa, even if she's not from my home district.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And she's Christian.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
That one was so nice to me.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
It really made me feel really good.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Yeah.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
And what was it about that that was so important for you?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
So important for me.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
I'm sitting with you because of her.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Yeah.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
I wouldn't have known that you exist if it were not for her.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
So that's why I call her magic.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
And another thing, I was, I had challenges with my first job.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
She still spoke, told me, go speak to certain certain people.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And right now I'm working.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
So to me, she's magic.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Yeah.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
She's magic.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
She turned around things for me in a joking way.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:32.000
She's a simple lady, but she's I don't know how we can mention it, but she came timely to me.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
She came timely because it was like going to be a challenge.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
But all of a sudden she had just a small sentiment.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Go to such a place.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And that was it.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
The story changed completely.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
And today I'm here with you.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
I wouldn't have known that you are here even if it were not for her.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:04.000
So we've talked a little bit about your hopes, which are around having another having a place where that can be tidy and your own.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Yeah.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Is there anything else you'd like to say about if you imagine the future, what you'd like it to look like?

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
The future in Wales could be in Wales.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Could be in Wales.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
I don't know what your future's going to look like.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
My future I would like it to be because I'm a mother of two and my children are not young.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
They are young adults.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:37.000
So in future, maybe if I settled down here, I'd like them to come to Wales and live with me.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Though my son told me, Mom, I can't handle the cold.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
I told him, you will get to know that people dress up like this and they handle.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
So he was still there.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Even if you're talking of me coming to visit, maybe when it's not cold.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
But with the cold, no.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:08.000
So my future, I look at it like settling down here, having my children come if they want to stay because you can't force an adult to do something.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
They can stay if they want to visit.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
They visit.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
So me, I'll be happy to stay here.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
I like Wales.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Yeah, I like Wales.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
That's fantastic. Thank you.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Is there anything that, thinking about this as a story that will, your story will be informing how future generations of people think about Wales.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
If it goes into the museum, it's about who are the people that live in Wales now.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
It's what we want to know.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Is there anything you haven't said that you would like to say that you would like to be noted or for people to know about?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Living in Wales?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Who you are living in Wales now, yeah.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Oh, me.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
No, I'm here.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
I haven't settled in very well.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:03.000
But I'm hoping to settle in because I came to work.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
And the job got some challenges, but like I told you, she was magic to me.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
She turned everything.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
So I'm hoping to see myself settle in when I settle in.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:25.000
In future, I don't know whether I can buy property here and I feel comfortable and I stop renting.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
I don't know whether it's possible, but that would be a very good option for me.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Buy property and stop renting.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
That's good.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
When people have had workmates, about two, they came from England.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
I even have a friend who came from England.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
When they come here, they don't want to go back.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
So they say Wales is very good.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Wales is very quiet.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Wales does not have too much traffic.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
I've also witnessed it.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
It doesn't have too much traffic.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000
The few times I've been to London, oh my God, it's too much traffic.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
The place is too busy and you feel like, no, I should go back.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Yeah, Wales is a good place.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
People come like they are visiting.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
People come like they are working.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Before they know, you've settled.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
My former workplace, there's a lady who said she came when she was younger than me.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.000
They've lived here for 45 years, but they just came like, you come on holiday with her husband.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
After today, they've never gone back.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
And they're from England.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:45.000
So Wales has got that gift of people wanting to leave the noisy place and coming here to settle.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Yeah.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Yeah.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
That's what I did.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Came from England.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Yeah.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
See?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Yeah.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
England is too much traffic, too much excitement, too much of everything.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Everybody is, oh, but here, people come.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
That's what I like.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
I like quiet environments and I like calm places.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.000
So when I get to England, therefore, a day or two, the third day, I'm like, I should go back.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
I should go back, yeah.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
That's brilliant.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Thank you.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Have you said everything that you want to say?

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Is there anything you'd like to say?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
I think so.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
If you have got more questions to ask me, I've no problem.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
We've covered all our questions, but so it's just if you want to.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Because it's a really good picture of what Wales is.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Now that the sun has come up, one person will like sitting at the beach all the time, looking at the water, seeing the sunset,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
seeing the water come towards me as I run away from it and back home.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
I did it a lot last year.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Every time I was free, I would go and see.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
I like looking at the water.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Yeah.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
I'm a beach person.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Me too.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Me too.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
It's so nice.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
So refreshing.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Just keep quiet there and look at the water.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Yeah.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Yeah, me too.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
That's brilliant.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Thank you so much.
