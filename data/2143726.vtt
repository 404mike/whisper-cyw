00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
Anyway, we arrived in Southampton and there was another enormous train.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.600
And on each seat of this train there were little boxes.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:23.920
And I vividly remember at home the only fruit you ate was what you picked off trees.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.080
I had never seen a banana.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.880
And I tried to eat this banana with the skin on because I had no idea what it was supposed to do.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.880
And there was an orange. I was trying to eat that.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.880
And people came along and showed us what to do.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.880
Another long journey.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.880
This time we arrived in London.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.680
It was absolutely terrifying.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.680
I knew nobody else.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.680
And we all had big labels on us with our names on it.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.680
Did your parents explain to you?

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.680
No. No one explained anything.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.680
No one ever explained anything.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.680
You had no idea what this meant.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.680
In those days one did not explain to a child.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.680
And I will suppose it to be a child.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.680
At ten, my father was too busy trying to cope.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.680
My mother trying to cope with the baby.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.680
Again, very pregnant.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.680
And the orphanage would tell you nothing at all.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:50.680
We arrived in this enormous, enormous hall in London, which was set in tiers.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.680
You know, platform.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.680
And we were all sort of spread out.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.680
And as your name was called, you'd have to go all the way down all the steps.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.680
And meet the complete stranger.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.680
Now with my luck, my name was Fairtime, so her tail ended again.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.680
I walked, my name was called.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.680
I walked down these steps.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.680
And I looked at this man.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.680
To me, he looked about eight foot tall.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.680
And he held out his hand for me.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.680
I put mine in his.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.680
And we walked away.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.680
He couldn't speak a word of German.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.680
I couldn't speak a word of English.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:53.680
We got to Paddington, which is the station, to bring me to Swansea, where I eventually lived.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.680
And he was so desperate, he didn't know what to do.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.680
And there was a little kiosk with soul sweets and chocolates.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.680
And there were some peaches.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.680
Now I knew about peaches.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.680
So I pointed to the peaches.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.680
And he went and got an enormous bag of peaches.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:23.680
And the journey from London to Swansea, where I eventually lived, in those days took about six and a half hours.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:33.680
And this poor man didn't know what to do, so he kept on feeding me peaches and wiping the juice off my chin.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.680
And then I would smile at him, because I didn't know what to say or do.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.680
And this poor man and I sat for six and a half hours with not one word between us.
