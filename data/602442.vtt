WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
How's that working? Can you tell me your name, just for the purposes of the recording?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Yes, Gareth Jones.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And are you from Swansea, Gareth?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yes, I'm from Morriston, Bournemouth.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So you grew up here, and when did you first go to a football match?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I think I was in my twenties, because I was working in town, and I finished at midday on a Saturday, so it was a kind of ritual.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I met some mates and made some prasada, do you remember the prasada? Are you from Swansea?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm not from Swansea, but where was that then? A pub, I presume?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Yes, by the castle, there's a green patch of grass to the right of the castle, and that's where the pub was, prasada.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Right by the old Eden & Post building.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And then we'd go down to the Wretch or St Helens.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Either or, you would go to whoever was playing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Because virtually one was home one week, and the other one the other week.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So whichever was at home.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We had no drafts, and it was very rare they were home the same day anyway.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So it would normally be like that every other week.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I used to go back to my mates then, to eat again, and then go down to Mumford Street with us.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
That was a busy Saturday.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It was a busy Saturday.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Sorry, can I ask you how old you are?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm seventy-six.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Seventy-six, right, so you didn't go when you were a child then?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Not a child.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Not when you were a grown-up?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I was in my twenties.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Yes, I was in my twenties.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I used to go there.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So that would have been, I can't word that out, in the 1960s.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Fifty years ago, was it?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Yeah, in the 1960s.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Yeah, yeah, sorry, I can't word that out.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I can't word it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Well, when were you born?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I was born in 1936.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So it would have been around the beginning of the 1960s.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Yeah.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And so was it more just like to go and watch a bit of sport rather than particularly the football or particularly the rugby?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Did you have a preference?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I've always had a preference for rugby.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Ah, right.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:26.000
You know, particularly now when people are playing football, I don't know what to call it.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I'm overpaid and...

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Overpaid.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I can't do that.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I can't do that.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I don't like it.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I did watch the Spanish game, the final.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It was the only one I watched.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And that was a good game.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
They were playing just like Swansea.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
They were.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Tim told you that there's a man here who used to play for us once?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Yes, but he's had a stroke.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
He's had a stroke, yeah, and he can't really...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
He'd be very excited that you were there.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
No, I was ashamed, but I understand we couldn't really talk to him.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Trying to remember the players around about things.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I go out yet, and then out yet.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Well, again, because they either had been away and come back again.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Yes, right.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Towards the end of his career.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Yeah.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And...

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Jones, there's a Jones boy, Jones, in the wing.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Barry, Barry Jones.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
No, I don't think it's Barry.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Cliff.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Cliff Jones.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Yeah, he was another international.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And of course the Swans had the best schoolboy team.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Indeed, yeah.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They were excellent.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
They were, it was really good.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And they came up through the ranks then, yeah.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:09.000
No, they had even back into the 1930s, they had schoolboy teams that won the cup, you know, for the whole country.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And there's a centre forward called Trevor Ford.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Oh yeah, he was a good local boy.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Oh yeah, he brought many in there, I think.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
He would just let it go in, otherwise he'd go in with it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I think there is a, I think I read a story about that, that he scored and the referee didn't give it, and he made them come and look, there was actually a hole in the net.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Yes, that's right, yeah.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
That's a...

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Which was good for...

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
He was very famous.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I'm trying to remember some defenders.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I can't quite remember.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I've been reading about them but I can't remember them all.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
No.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So then, but did you carry on going there?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
No, I...

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I stopped going to both actually when I got married.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Yeah.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I got married in 66.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Right, so...

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And I didn't bother.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And not only that, I just realised now, the company I was working for, I was a travel agent.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
They started opening all day Saturday.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Oh, so that was it.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
To now the naps.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So I've been down the stadium.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
The new one?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Yeah.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Did you go, because Tipper was saying he took a group of people down there, or have you been on the...

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:57.000
No, I've been down, yeah, I've just had to pluck up courage, you know, I'm starting to get myself, pull myself together, it's a quite fascinating time.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And I'm going out tomorrow with my steps and I'm coming over from Florida to see me, you know.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So I'm going down to Mumbles.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I'm going to be living only my second time out.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Really?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Yeah.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
You wouldn't be drinking quite as much as...

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Quite as much, but I like it.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Not when you were 20.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I got one there.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Oh, I like that.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
That's my lunchtime...

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Perotif, is it, Igor?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Excellent.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I stopped after that, so I was very short-lived in the vegetable.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We all was under the double decker.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Ah, right, yeah.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And that was a beautiful, well, it wasn't a beautiful stand, but everybody there in the vegetable did.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I don't know, it was a...

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Well, it was very, very swish and new when they built it in 1927.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It was quite modern.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:09.000
We were just under it, just under it to the right, so we could see the goal, the slide down there.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Right.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So many a goal going there.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Didn't the away supporters go up that end as well?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
No, I think the away supporters were on the...

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
On the little...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
What do you think about that?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
The towel end.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Yeah, of course they built a stand there after I left, so I think a lot of them were put in there.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I can't be sure about that.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Yeah, they...

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Because I think Leighton, yeah, I think they used to...

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Oh, I can't remember, I used to go down there in the 1980s, but I think they built that stand at the towel end.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
That's right, that would have been called the North Stand.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The North Bank was the main home, terrace was there all along that one side.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And there was a little bank at one end, the town, the bus station.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
The end behind one end, that's right, yeah.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And then they double-decked it.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Well, I'd stopped going a long time before that, so I can't be sure.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
But it was...

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It was a long time ago that I saw a football match, a live football match.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Oh, right, so you said you'd been to the stadium, but just to have a look.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I was just going to see Robbie.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I have come here to see the...

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Because I am a rugby man.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Yeah.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And I went with my sister and family there to season tickets.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Oh, right, right.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He and my mother, some of us couldn't go either, through the streets kind of.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Yeah, but was it a bit... because the Swans, I mean the Whites still play at St Helens.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
The Whites still play at St Helens, yeah.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Because they are not quite at the same standard.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
No, no.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And Neath, of course, they still got a side.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Yeah.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So... and that's in Neath.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Yeah.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And they all got...

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
The north.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
The north, yeah.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
But did... I mean, now you've seen... I know it's not quite as thing...

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I was a bit more interested in the football,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
but interested to know what you think about watching any game up at the Liberty,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
say compared to St Helens or the...

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Oh, I think the Liberty is a fine stadium.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Did you prefer it, do you think?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Yes, absolutely.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And the pitch was brilliant.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Yeah, I mean, it's great.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Yeah. It's the same at the end of the season, is it?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Or was it the beginning of the season, kind of?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And there's no... because the... I mean, people...

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Well, especially the Vetch people look...

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
But it's quite nostalgic, the vision of it, but it was pretty scrubby.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I thought this dude would be knocked down.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
It has been. It's gone now.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Has it gone?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Yeah, it's an empty space.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It's been left in circulation for the last six, eight months.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
But it's... it's finally been demolished.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Right. And they put in hoses and screws and...

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
There's nothing... I'm not sure if there's any real concrete plan.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
It's just an empty space at the moment.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And they stay as a park or something.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I don't really know, but they...

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I don't think it has gone, I see.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I've been on the circulation for...

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
...three, four months.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
They just sat there, falling down for five or six years.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I think they thought they'd better get rid of it before it falls.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Before it falls or something.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Yeah, well, there was always...

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Always people complaining that bits were falling off it into their houses and things like that.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
It was never...

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
You can't have that, yeah.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
No, but it was...

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So, was there any...

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Is there any particular soccer match you can remember, any particular high spot of your...

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I think it's when we went into the...

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
...the First Division, maybe.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Yeah.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
When we beat Leeds-Millard here.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
That was some of the red.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I think there was... I can't be sure, but I think there was a back here.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Oh, you went... So you did go back for the OB game...

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Yes.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
...after you were stopped in a regular.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Yeah, I was divorced by them.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Sorry?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I was divorced by them.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Oh, right.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
So I was in your game.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
But, no, I think I went there.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Hmm.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I just...

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
What was the...

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Very few.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Yeah.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000
But you didn't have any children to take down there or anything?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Yes, I did, however, but...

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
My son was, again, more interested in rugby.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Ah, he was over it, and there wasn't any pressure to get...

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And my daughter wasn't interested in any sport.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Oh, fair enough.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Well, drop this for a...

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
She was busy studying computer on the nurse.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Oh, right. That's fair enough.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
She's done very well.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Because it seemed...

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Because talking to quite a few people, it seems there's a real,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
oh, my grandfather took me down there,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
or my father took me down there.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
It's often been something that...

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
It's a kind of part of growing up in Swansea has been to be taken down to the...

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
For people all around me, but they...

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Yeah.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
They were, oh, fair enough.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Well, that's it. We've probably more sides at the moment.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Mmm, yeah.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Osprey's just won the...

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
...air championship.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Yes. What do you call it?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
God knows how I get confused.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
All right?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
How are you doing?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
OK, thanks, sir.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Excellent. Are you remembering?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Just, it's very hard.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Yeah, that's good stuff. He needs more beer, though.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Oh, you're right.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
That's good.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Well, at the moment, Jack is sitting in the dining room,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and he has an auditorium full of people.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Really?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Yeah, he's having...

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I don't know if he's going to get anything...

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Is he recording them?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
He is recording, yeah. He is recording.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
But I don't know if he's going to get anything of...

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
He's talking to one of the ladies who remember sitting outside the bench,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
waiting for her husband to come out.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Do you need more consent forms?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Probably, yeah.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I'll photocopy some. I've got some up here.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Don't worry. Sorry, Gareth, I think I'm going to second it.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
But if it's something that you need to do afterwards,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
don't worry about...

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
OK.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
There's no rush for us to take...

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Yeah, all right, it is.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Just to kind of...

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
You know, dotting the eyes kind of thing.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Just again, to make sure maybe you can see...

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
We would have had no way in.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
It's too bad he doesn't want to do that, sir.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Yeah, but...

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
No problem.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Right.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Well, that sounds quite exciting.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
God knows what he's finding out, doesn't it?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Mind you, having said that, I don't know what else I can ask you guys.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
But you never went to an away game or anything?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Oh, no, I wasn't that keen.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I wasn't that keen. It was right behind us.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
But it was just...

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
As a whole, mind you.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
It was just a bit of entertainment for you rather than a passion.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Yeah, well, I worked Saturdays, you see.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Well, that doesn't help, does it?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
That doesn't help, does it, sir?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Mm.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Don't know, yeah.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
But do you think...

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Yeah, I suppose it's always been a part of the town.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
They've always had the football and the rugby club.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Oh, yes, yes.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
But now...

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
But he was saying now, do you think it's more...

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I mean, is it a bigger thing now that they're premiered?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Oh, yeah, yes.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I think it will help to increase the crowds at the stadium as well.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Was it...

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I mean, William brings in people, doesn't he?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I think so.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Yeah, I think it puts Swansea on the map around the world.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Yeah.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
It's been great.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
They did very well to stay up.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Because very often people come up, go straight back down.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Because in the 1980s, the Swans came up from the 4th Division as it was.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Yeah.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Right up to the 1st Division.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Actually in the top of the 1st Division for one week.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Yeah, once.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Once.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And they went back down and they were up in the 4th Division again.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Well, they had one good year and they finished...

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
They were sixth when they finished.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And then there was the following year, it just went...

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Glance, yeah.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And that probably was the year that they, at the last game of the season, decided whether they stayed in the 2nd Division or...

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
There was a bit later, there was a...

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Yeah, sorry, carry on.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
The match they played was, if they won, they stayed in the 2nd Division.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I think that's the Lewis Division now.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
That was a bit later, yeah, that was in 2003.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
2003, was it?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Yeah.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And if they lost, they could go down to the...

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Into the...

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Abyss.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Into the conference, as it's called, out of the...

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
What's the word? Abyss, yeah?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
The what?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
The Abyss.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Oh, the Abyss, oh yeah, definitely into the footballing Abyss.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Oh yeah, you're quite right, they would have...

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Because Rexall was never come back.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Newport was never come back.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
No.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
No, Rexall nearly did last year.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Yeah.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
So they might do better this year.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
But yeah, you're right, it's...

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
So that one...

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
It's happening.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Yeah.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
The graph of the ups and downs of the 100 years.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
The unit team would have come straight up from the 4th to the 3rd to the 2nd...

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Was it the 2nd Division then?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Yeah, there were 4 Division...

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Anyway, I think they had one stop along the way, I think they were 2 years in one.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
It was still the quickest rise, I think, of anybody in that.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
And the quickest get back down again.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Oh, they went down quick and they came up.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
But yeah, I think this coach will do well, because he likes...

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
He used to play our style of football.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I think that's why they liked him.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Yeah.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And they... yeah.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
I think hopefully they'll do well.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Nice.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
It's a 2-year contract, but hopefully they'll extend it.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Well, we'll see.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Yeah.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
That'll be fun.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Watch this space.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Yeah.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Oh, that's great though, but is there anything else?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I hope they have some help.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
That's brilliant.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
It's all... yeah.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
See, it's a project just trying to get...

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Just all the memories and experiences of the fans over...

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
It's a pity you can't speak to them.
