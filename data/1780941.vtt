WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
So I'm just switching this on now Sue, so this is running.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.320
This is running.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.520
Are you OK there?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.520
Mm hmm.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.520
It ended up though.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:24.120
Erm, erm, yeah just talking about the erm, the, did you ever go fishing in the reens

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.120
or anything like that?

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.120
Oh yes, yes.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.040
From time, about four or five of you always had a jam jar with a string on it and went

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.480
for tadpoles because once the frogspawn was out, yes I used to do it with my children

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.680
and my grandchildren and er, yeah there were always things in the reen.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.360
And here, er David growing up, they had flatfish, they had eels, er they even caught place in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.400
the stream, amongst itch and children used to come out of town to fish on our bridges

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.960
and oh yeah, it was quite the thing.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.800
So you, you, as a young girl, you know entering your teenage years, I've heard that erm,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.360
the young farmers clubs around here was erm, like a marriage bureau in many ways.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.120
Yes, we're all guilty of using it.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.960
Because it's very quiet.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.800
What did you do as a teenager here?

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.480
I mean where was the focus?

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480
Was it Newport?

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.480
Was it Chepstow?

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.480
Was it Nash?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.640
No, erm, you see there wasn't a local young farmers club.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:42.480
We'd go into Newport to join the Beyslic and Hentless young farmers club and erm, we depended

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:52.000
on erm, David's cousins who had vehicles, er, who were quite a bit older than me and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.400
they would take us.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.880
The only other club was Maga and there was no way of getting there.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.840
David, my husband, belonged to Maga.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.160
And I spoke our lives to really, erm, we went to, erm, to Trudiga House to the convent to

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:16.440
And all our friends there were farmers daughters, so we would join young farmers and still be

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.440
all together.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.800
And in fact, 70 years later we're all still together.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.760
Same girls we were at school with, young farmers and all our lives.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.640
So yes, it was erm, it got us out.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.880
We took part in competitions all over the county, erm, there were the rallies, there

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:47.520
was drama, erm, public speaking quizzes and then you got to know young farmers from all

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.600
over Monmouthshire.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.000
Erm, and there was always a dance every week somewhere or other.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.720
Only this week there was a picture of the ballroom in the Westgate Hotel in Newport

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.960
and David and I were looking at it and saying, we went to balls there in our black ties and

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:17.200
sequin dresses and, erm, it was a wonderful organisation.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.680
We went to hunt balls at the King's Head Hotel in Newport.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.760
In those days when everything was, I suppose, totally different as we know it now, as a

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:47.800
child, erm, you see in 1950, oh, 53, 54, they decided to send the children from Nash School

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.400
to a newly opened Langstone Primary School.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.360
So I was nine at the time and I was sent, and we were picked up by bus in the village,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.320
all of us children at that age, sent to Langstone School.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.160
Well, we started making friends over there and most of those were rural families.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.040
So you got to know people there and I even moved on to the convent with one friend.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:27.120
Erm, so it just seemed quite a small, although it was a large area physically, it didn't

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.000
appear to be to us as children because our parents knew most of the farming families

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.600
and we were all drawn in together and young farmers just seemed to be a culmination of

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.760
us all still being together.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.120
And yes, I met David there at Magy Young Farmers, we had a, there was a dance, I believe

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.400
it was Redwick Hall when I first met him, and although we lived in the same villages,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.120
Nash never seemed to come to Whitsun and Goldcliffe and vice versa.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.680
You see, we had our own vicar at Nash and Whitsun and Goldcliffe had their vicar who

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:16.800
lived in the vicarage here and it wasn't until 1953 that Nash was taken in.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.280
Excuse the phone, it's just ringing.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:32.240
So yes, and then things changed because the churches were brought together, people, we

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.680
formed social committees and so forth.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:43.320
So I didn't know him even though we only lived three miles apart.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.920
So it just didn't really mix with the other villages on the levels?

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.520
So you were saying for Redwick as well?

00:05:49.520 --> 00:06:00.240
Well yes, we had family out in Redwick and we would, you see, only my father and Donald

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.040
and Dorothy Waters had a car in our village in Nash, they were only two cars.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.360
Well you can't imagine life like that.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.160
And yes, so people didn't drive around the villages.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.760
So you said you had to finish policemen, did you have a, I'd like to know a bit more about

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.160
him, did you have a Finnish midwife?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:32.480
No, no, but we had a lady who was a district nurse, not for this area, we had two in the

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:41.760
village, one on Broad Street Common, Nurse Griffiths, and one at Burned House in Nash,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.720
Margaret Waters, but she was a district nurse in another area.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:57.040
But there was a story that when Nurse Griffiths, when David was born, it was the winter of 1939

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:06.960
and it was one of the coldest winters apparently, and when he was born his mother brought him

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.240
home from the nursing home and he was very sickly and they didn't quite know what to do.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:20.160
So Nurse Griffiths, now there were no cars, there was nothing, Nurse Griffiths came over

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.240
and they would have walked across fields in those days and she said to my mother and father

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:35.200
in law, you give me the baby, you bring him down, I'll look after him, otherwise he'll

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.520
die.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.840
So that's what happened and she kept him for several weeks and kept him alive.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.920
I don't quite know what was wrong and every night David's father, after he had milked,

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:56.840
put a sack around himself and he'd walk down to the common, which would be a little way

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.920
across the fields or round the road, whichever, and he said that he could hear the icicles

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.920
banging on the trees.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.720
Anyway a couple of weeks later they brought the baby back.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:21.480
So that was one experience that we know of where a district nurse kept her eye on everything.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.960
But I remember my mother in law saying before her time even, they always had a midwife or

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.120
nurse to come and live in the farmhouses when the baby was due.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.120
Really?

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.120
Yes.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:43.320
She remembers her mother having for her siblings and obviously could remember being told all

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.320
that, told me.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.320
Amazing.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.520
So you said you went to the convent in Tredegar.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.520
House, yes.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.520
So I'm imagining it was a Catholic convent.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520
Yes.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.520
So are you a Catholic?

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.520
No.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.800
So why would you have gone there?

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.320
In those days we had a system of you had to pass your 11 plus exam to go to a grammar

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.560
school.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.640
If you didn't you went to a secondary modern school.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:19.560
And I guess my parents felt it might benefit me not going to a secondary school.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.960
So it was a fee-paying school.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.520
It was private.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:31.080
They had a system that they would take Catholic children if they passed the 11 plus without

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.960
fees.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:40.760
So a lot of families had the chance to go there who couldn't probably afford it otherwise.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.840
I passed the entrance exam to go.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.120
My father paid the fees.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.960
I went along with, as I say, quite a few other farmers' daughters.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.320
If you weren't clever that's what you did.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.920
So what was it like?

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.520
Oh absolutely, absolutely brilliant.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.600
Looking back how lucky we were.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.680
There were only three, just under 300 children altogether.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.040
And I don't know if you've ever been to Tredegar House, the National Trust place now.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.360
Most of the school was open, all the rooms, I mean they've closed a lot off and you don't

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.640
see those these days.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.320
But there were borders there.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.440
I think there must have been 40 or 50 borders.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.120
So you'd have service families sending their children there from abroad or, well they were

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.440
out in services.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:38.960
And yes it's hard to describe.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.160
The rooms were as they are.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.680
They were in good condition and the nuns took it over.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.520
Did you have a uniform?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.520
Oh yes, yes.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:57.720
Yes, navy blue and blue, dark blue.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.920
It's not long ago I gave my school scarf to the exhibition in the house.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920
Really?

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:09.160
Yes, us old girls put an exhibition on in one of the classrooms of life as it was when

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.160
we were there.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:19.000
Yes, we had nuns for most of the lessons but there were other teachers there besides.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.440
There was nothing we couldn't do.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.840
We had tennis courts, hockey pitches.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.920
We used to have art classes in the gardens in the summer.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.800
You'd sit on the wall by the lake and draw the lilies or sit in the garden and draw Sir

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.240
Briggs' memorial.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.520
The Orangery as they call it now was our gym.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.360
The gilt room was our art room.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.560
All the nuns were pretty nice.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:54.080
We had one or two that perhaps weren't so kind.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.920
We had the brown room where all the carvings were.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.320
We were told at the time it was by Gryndle and Gibbons but they say it might have been

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.360
his school but not him.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:11.000
That was our music room and we had several grand pianos in there.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.800
We would have music every week, theory of music.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.080
Beautiful library underneath the stairs.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.080
Which is no...

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.560
So why you received your schooling there?

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.440
Were you also schooled in the connections of Tredegar House and the estate with the

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.360
levels or was that something you learned after?

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.280
I suppose we grew up knowing that most of the farms in this area were owned by the Tredegar

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.640
estate and it was in the 50s that they had to sell them off because of what Evan had

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:49.480
done with the money and all the farmers round and about bought them at a very reasonable

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.640
price I understand.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.000
I don't think the nuns went into any great detail about it.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.840
I do remember and I've said this to some of the guides and I'm not sure they believe me

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:17.680
that I remember in the late 50s Olga, the French countess, coming to the school.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:25.440
We were told to be on good behaviour and she came in a car, a chauffeur driven car, very

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:32.640
tall elegant woman and I often wondered if I dreamt it because nobody else seems to remember.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.080
I'm curious.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.200
But I remember her coming up the steps you see into the front hall, whether I happened

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.800
to be in the vicinity at the time I don't know.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.720
But as you come into the house and you've got this big hall that was where we had our

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:57.560
assembly every day and Sister St. Brendan would stand on a big tall seat so she could

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:04.000
see over the top of us and we'd sing all the Catholic hymns before we went into our classes

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.960
and have prayers and pray for everybody that needed help or you know prayers for that morning

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:18.640
and we would disperse to our classrooms and before every lesson we said Hail Mary.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.640
I can recite it now as quick as lightning.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720
Oh my goodness.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.480
Do you remember what order they were, the nuns?

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.280
Yes, St. Joseph's.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.280
St. Joseph's?

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:41.480
Yes because as it happened during that period my grandma owned Tearshift Farm which is the

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.920
Abbey Farm belonging to St. Joseph's at Lentarnham.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:52.160
And our farm was on the same drive as theirs and when I was a little girl I spent all my

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.880
summers back and forth with my grandmothers and then of course when I went to the convent

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.440
they used our butcher shop for their all-in-meat because we were right against them.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:10.400
So yes and I had a cousin who was head girl when I started the convent and she became

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.800
a nun there.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800
Really?

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800
Yes.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800
Goodness.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.760
So yes, St. Joseph's.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:26.560
And of course they opened a nursing home there at Lentarnham and at that time my mother had

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:32.280
poor health and she used the nursing home quite frequently so I got to know the nuns

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.280
over there quite well.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.280
Oh gosh.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.280
Yes.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.480
So presumably when you were going there were you going by bus or bike?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.480
To the convent?

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.480
Yes.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:47.640
Yes we'd catch the bus at Nash Arch just after eight o'clock.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.520
You'd get into Newport and the bus station was in the centre opposite the market in those

00:15:52.520 --> 00:16:01.440
days and we had three double-deckers all lined up with our name on it which we got on and

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:09.200
went to school and they parked in the driveway, not the front drive where the lodges are,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.520
and we had a back drive and the buses pulled in and we would have to walk the whole end

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.360
of that drive to school then, no matter what the weather was like.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.240
And I do remember once it had all been flooded that both lakes came over, the Red Lake and

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.880
the Big Lake, they met in the middle and we all had to walk through it.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.400
Yes, I remember that.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:39.480
So we started school then at twenty to ten, so it took us from, I don't know, twenty

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.400
to nine to twenty to ten to get from there and walk and assemble.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.400
Yes.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.760
So, and then the same thing, we finished school at quarter to four, got back into Newport

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.560
about half past four after you.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.960
You know, it's a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes to walk up the drive.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.520
So that's quite a bit, isn't it?

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:08.240
Yes, but it was, I suppose at the time we probably didn't enjoy school that much, but

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.720
it depended how good you were at things.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.520
Looking back, I think we were very privileged, very privileged.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:23.080
Do you know, as a child growing up in Nash, were you, do you remember what the wildlife

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.000
was like or were you aware of wildlife?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.120
Oh yes, very much so.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:37.560
Yes, because, you know, it was all under the, you know, under the farmer's jurisdiction,

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.560
wasn't it?

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.400
And we didn't have nitrogen and fertilizers and such.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:52.760
Yes, I remember, perhaps, we didn't have rabbits in the village, you see, whereas now we've

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.160
got some leopards outside the door virtually every morning.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.120
My daughter sees them feeding.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:06.120
We've got a lot more wildlife here than there used to be when we were farming intensively.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:14.520
But as a child, yes, we used to go looking for bird's nests.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.680
We didn't used to take the eggs, but we knew where all the bird's nests were.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:27.840
And if you were down the field, there'd be wasps and bees' nests and we had adders.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.080
And my father used to, we had long grass in one of the orchards.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.880
Father used to say, now don't you go down there, the snakes will bite you.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.800
And we didn't used to listen.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.560
So we got up one Sunday morning and there was this adder.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:47.240
He'd, obviously it had been killed or dead or some reason or other, and he'd wormed

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.400
it round the plum tree as a warning to us.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400
Really?

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400
Yeah.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.120
But mind you, I'm never quite sure if it was a real adder or whether it was a grass snake

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.840
because we couldn't tell the difference as kids.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.080
Yeah, owls, you always had owls hooting.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.680
Yeah, I can't explain really.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.880
But you were always aware of it.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.880
Yeah.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.560
Did you ever do things like fruit picking or...

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.160
Yes.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.160
...things like that?

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:30.400
Well, when they were building the power station, we had this couple of orchards on the farm.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:36.240
So my brother and I would pick all the plums and we'd set a stall up on the road outside

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:42.200
the, what you call it, the hedge.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.280
And we'd put plums, tuppence a pound, and we'd sell every plum we could get.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.280
Really?

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.280
Yes.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.280
Oh.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.280
It was brilliant.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.280
How lovely.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.280
You know, tuppence in those days was quite a lot for children.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.280
Yeah.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:01.120
And then in the autumn I used to pick loads of blackberries and we'd take them into the

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.920
butcher shop and they'd sell them for me.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.920
Really?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.920
And I'd get sixpence a pound.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.920
Well, the butcher shop in Newport.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.920
Yeah.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.920
Yeah.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.880
Yeah, you did things like that and all local farmers would sell their apples.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.400
You could only keep so many.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.600
Did your farm make cider or anything like that?

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.600
No.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600
No.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600
No.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.160
Quite a few of the Waters family used to make cider.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.160
I know.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.880
Oh, there's lots of stories about the cider.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.880
For another day perhaps.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.880
Oh gosh.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.880
Yeah.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.720
Because you see it was such an industry down here.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.000
What do you mean cider?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.120
Cider, the villages were plastered with orchards all along the Severn.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.120
Yeah.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:21:01.360
And cider was a, you see, when you had men working for you back in the 1900s, you paid

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.040
them with cider and bread and cheese.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.840
They didn't expect wages, a lot of them, if they just had food and shelter.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.320
So cider was the drink.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.520
I mean, you've got to imagine now there was no fresh water going back in the 1800s, haven't

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.520
you?

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.840
And everything was ale and cider.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.120
And I assume that's why all the orchards were.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.200
I mean, we had an orchard full of peri-pears.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.560
So they were obviously making the peri-drink or the champagne or whatever they used them

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.560
for.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.200
So lots of the orchards have gone?

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.760
Oh yes, yes.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.640
I mean, this, where you've parked the car, opposite there's a big tract of land.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:47.160
When I came here, that was a huge orchard, it's an acre and a half almost.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.880
And the cows ruined that.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.080
And we had four orchards here, all quite large.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.200
So we had a couple of acres.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.920
And did you have a press here?

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.920
Cider press?

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.920
No, no.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:04.520
They used to, you see this cider press of Duthies used to travel around the village

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.640
and do it.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.400
After that, when tractors and trailers came into being, they used to take them up to us

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.960
college and have the cider pressed up there.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.280
Oh, right.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.280
Yeah.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.800
I'm not aware of anybody having a stone cider press in this area, except the one at Redwick

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:29.400
in the, that Hubert Jones renovated.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.960
So we've got a mill wheel in the back garden.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.040
And that obviously from a local mill, I would think.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.440
But no, everybody had cellars with their cider barrels in them.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.120
I can remember as a child.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.120
Really?

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.120
Yeah.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.120
Yeah.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.120
Did you ever try it?

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.120
Yes.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.440
You weren't meant to, but you did.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:59.160
Elizabeth, my friend, we'd be sent down the cellar.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.280
And these cellars were above ground mined.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.240
We'd be sent and they built onto the house.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.840
We were sent down the cellar to collect the cider for supper.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.840
In what?

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840
What would you collect?

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.840
Jugs.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.960
You'd take a jug and they'd have a tap on the barrels.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.680
And yeah, you'd have a little sample before you got to the back of the house.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.400
It's a horrible mind when you're a child.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.400
You don't enjoy it.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.400
So that was normal.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400
Oh, yes.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.400
Cider with supper.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.400
Yes.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.400
Yeah.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.400
I can remember going to houses and having cider with supper.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.400
Gosh.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:39.400
And what, are there any other cider stories you alluded to that?

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:46.400
Well, you see, you always sort of gave the men cider.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.800
I remember my mother, when we were children, and you'd always have a lot of people come

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.160
for haymaking look.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.000
Every farmer did.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.720
And she would have, we had what we called the tea basket.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.360
And it was like this, really big.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.520
And she'd fill it with food.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:10.400
And then you'd have cider or something to take down for them to drink with it.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.920
You didn't have orange squash in those days.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.200
You didn't have pop, nothing.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.360
And it was difficult taking tea because you didn't even have flasks, probably.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.080
So cider was the answer to everybody's needs.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.320
And we'd walk down the fields.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:31.000
And I suppose we used to have to help her carry things that she didn't want on her arm.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Yeah.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:43.640
So did you have much, I know we talked about this earlier, but so you growing up and living

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:50.440
on the levels or the moors, what's special about it?

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.040
What's different about it to somebody who's not from the area?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.800
What could you say?

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.720
I wouldn't know.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.600
That what you could say specifically.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.560
I used to spend a lot of time with my friends at their farms as I was growing up in my teens

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.760
now, late teens, mid teens.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.440
And it would be very difficult to pinpoint.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:24.720
If you lived in a village, a village life was different, wasn't it, to living in a town.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:31.640
I suppose we took everything for granted, you see, living on the levels.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.320
That was just where you were.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:40.880
I found it very funny because my friend lived at Deustoe House in Caldecott.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.800
When I went up there, I was constantly ploughing up hills.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:52.120
I used to think, oh, this is not so easy as living on the levels.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.520
So I do remember that.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.560
That's funny.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.520
And they had a lot more trees up there.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:07.480
I think there weren't that many trees down here of various varieties.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.720
Oh, yes, there was ash everywhere.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.760
And that's where, as you know, Nash got its name from.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.760
No, I...

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.280
Was the ash used for anything in particular?

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.760
Was it a crop in any way?

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:33.000
I think I've read where they used to feed the cattle in the winter, holly and ash.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.400
But I suppose there would still be the ash keys still on the trees in the winter.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.400
I don't...

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.400
Not specifically.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.080
It was just the grove of ash trees, wasn't it, Nash, was?

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:54.560
So on your land, say, now, when they was a child, would you know what reams and water

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.240
courses run through your land?

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.800
Would you know the names of them?

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.600
Yes, yes.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:07.400
In fact, I've mapped most of the area with the reams, marked on them.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.840
For future generations, that is, who...

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.960
It's one thing looking at a big map where you can barely read what's on there.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.040
But I've detailed absolutely everything.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.840
And I'm in the process of...

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.360
Oh, there are dozens to do, and I've only done perhaps four or five.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.600
But it's still in the process.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.160
Of the whole area?

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.480
Yeah, well, Goldcliff, Whitsun and parts of Nash.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.680
Really?

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.200
Yes.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.040
Has there been any surprises for you?

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.120
Do you have any favourites, any names you like?

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.000
Um, they all...

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:49.080
There's a reason why they're all called what they are, like Monkscroft just above us.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.000
And Windmill Ream, as you can imagine.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.480
I know Tony Pickup said something to me about Windmill Ream, and I said, which one do you mean?

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.920
Because there are several, you see.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:07.000
All close to where the windmills were originally.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.360
Yeah, Elver Pill, a lot of them are self-explanatory.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.280
Ah...

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.880
Yes, when you're farming, you see, you've got to be able to know the names,

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.240
so that when you're talking to the drainage or the riverborders, as it once was,

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:28.840
you can tell them the name of the ream that you want cast, or something done to it.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.960
There's no good just saying, I want that ream down there.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.480
And do you know where the water runs, which direction it goes?

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.440
Yes, yes.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.320
Like Parish Ream goes basically right round the parish.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:46.280
And then we know where the outlets are, the gouts,

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.160
all the things that farmers should know,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.600
where the intake of water comes out of the pill into our farm,

00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:00.080
we've got sluices, and we know if we need to cast a ream,

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.040
the water isn't getting down to a certain part of the farm.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.120
When you say cast a ream, what do you mean?

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.120
Oh, clean it out.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.800
Oh, right, OK.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.880
Yes.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:17.240
I remember most of my younger life, before they had the ditches and machinery,

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.200
there were a couple of old gentlemen who used to clean the reams out

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:28.080
with their billocks and their various named instruments,

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.040
and they spent the entire summer doing that, well, under winter,

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.040
but you saw the difference in the summer.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.520
I can see them out here now.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.080
You can?

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.080
And they cut my Witson boss tree off one year and I was very cross.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:49.360
Bill England, Alv Stevens, oh, Hubert Jones was another one,

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:54.080
and they would keep those reams as clear,

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.400
far better than they do with the machinery today.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.600
You know, it's...

00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.640
Who were they paid by?

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.640
Were they paid by...?

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.080
It was the river board in those days.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.840
Yes, we pay a levy, you see.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:17.120
I think we've just paid about £280 for natural resource whales now, it is,

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:23.560
and that's towards maintenance of our drainage system.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.400
So, if they're managing that for you as farmers,

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.520
do you still have to keep an eye on it?

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.720
Oh, yes, because last year, for instance,

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:38.040
we've got a main ring called Wainbridge ring going right up through our farm.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:43.520
They come with the ditcher, they cast it,

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:53.560
so then you've got, oh, 20, at least 20, 25 feet of spoil all over your grass,

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.360
just when you want to make silage or hay.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.280
And that, if you take it right through the farm, adds up to several acres.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:10.520
They go away, and we then have to get somebody to spread it, which costs.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.600
Then you have to...

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.800
This year, our tractor went on fire.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:23.560
We couldn't do what we normally do by rotivating it and breaking it down

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.080
and sowing the grass.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.560
So we then have to pay for all that.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:33.680
And this happens every other year that some ream or ditch needs to be done out,

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.600
and we have to bear the cost of it.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:42.080
So they all, of the maintenance then, they pay for the ditcher to clean it out.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.200
After that, it's our problem.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:49.560
So when it was the internal drainage board, did a farmer have more of a voice?

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:53.760
Yes, yes, because the farmers were on there to represent the farmers.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.520
OK.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.240
And they knew exactly what should be done and how it should be done.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.120
Yeah.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.880
Since then, we have people who have no knowledge of our area.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.280
Yeah.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.680
They don't understand what we're talking about.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:13.160
And we're having to put up with what we consider may eventually end up with floods,

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.520
because they're not taking any notice of the farmers.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:20.160
So even though there is an advisory board now, that doesn't have as much...

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.600
Cloud, no, no.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.840
I mean, Neville Water was... our cousin was on it.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:35.400
And whilst he was on it, we knew that things were done according to spec as they should be.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:42.960
And then when you lose people like that, who've also passed this knowledge down to others,

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.800
when you lose that, yeah, I think it's the end of an era personally.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:55.160
See, that's what interests me, is this knowledge that's embedded within...

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.960
The local community, isn't it?

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:05.160
Because this whole water network is so curious to me that...

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.640
How do you pass that knowledge on?

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.920
Well, this is the sad part about it, because we had no sons.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.920
And our daughters don't know what we know.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.120
It's never interested them.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:24.800
I shall leave my maps, and I hope one day they may be interested to look at them.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.640
But I wasn't interested until latter years, I guess.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.640
And suddenly you think, oh, well, we've told them where the feeding areas are,

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:42.040
and they must make sure how to feed the land from the pill.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:46.320
Rick Turner was amazed when we showed him our noggle.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:54.400
A noggle, it's a key we turn to let the water in from the pill to feed our farm.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:02.160
Because if you don't turn it on here, on our bridge, there's hundreds of acres it feeds.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.760
So you have to be so acutely aware of the conditions.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.720
Yeah, so if we don't teach our girls after our days,

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.280
they won't be able to tell anybody else, will they?

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.160
So that's what's so special about this area, isn't it?

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:20.560
This part of its specialness is this water drainage system.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.680
Oh, yes.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.560
It's very...

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:29.200
I suppose it would be terribly complicated for a new person moving in, needing to know.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.560
But you see, most of these farms are passed down.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.240
People don't come in and buy these farms.

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.360
They just keep going.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.640
So would you say most of the farms are several generations strong?

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.400
Oh, yes, yes.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.760
I can't think of any that aren't, really.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.800
Yes, you get people who come in and buy a few acres, perhaps 12 acres with a house.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:55.280
That doesn't really count in my book.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.360
What about the, you know, the putcher ranks that used to be out there?

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.400
Do you remember them?

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.640
Oh, gosh, yes, yes.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.040
Which ones do you recall?

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:12.040
Well, mostly the ones at Goldcliff Point, and there were some at Porton.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.480
I remember those.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.520
Yes, when we were children, we'd come down...

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.520
I don't know.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.960
I'm just wondering how we did come down.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:30.480
We'd walk from Nash very often along the Seaball Bank.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.240
Yeah, we did that on many occasions.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.560
And then you'd have to come in and buy the pill and then get back out.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.720
It was difficult, but we did it.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:46.240
I suppose as we were growing up, I used to hear stories from my mother-in-law, who was

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:56.280
born at the hill, and they had a house there, not as it is today, obviously.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.560
And Mr. Fennell owned the house, and he owned the fisheries.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.880
And every summer, they would decamp from Newport.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.960
They were quite wealthy people, and they would decamp to this house, bring the servants

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.960
as well.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:17.560
And my mother and Nora, who lived with her family there, would...

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:23.920
You know, they were really good friends, and mother said they got that they were so fed

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.160
up with salmon by the end of the summer, because they had it for most meals.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160
Gosh.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.800
Yes, and then there were stories about Eaton College having the salmon being sent up to

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.320
Eaton College once a year on the train for a big supper.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.320
Yeah.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.080
Did they own some land here?

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:50.720
Eaton College owned all the land around here after the Reformation and all of that period

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.720
in time.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.720
Did they?

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.600
Yes, they owned all this land until the squires came in and bought...

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.120
Because it had been owned by monks?

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.120
Yes.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.640
Of course it was taken over, wasn't it?

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.640
Yeah.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.640
Oh.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.640
Oh, yes.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.640
I've got loads on that in my book.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640
Oh, goodness.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.240
So, the putches, yes, we...

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:17.480
And then as we were here farming and so forth, you always went down and got several salmon

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.480
in a summer.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.480
Did you?

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.480
Oh, yes.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.480
And there was nothing.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:28.240
The taste of a seven salmon, there is nothing like it.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.360
We'd cook whole salmon and...

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.360
Wow.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.360
Did you have a fishing kettle?

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.360
I've got one, yes, on my shelf.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.360
Oh.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.160
Yeah, so it was absolutely amazing.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:47.320
This went on right up until the late 90s, 96, 97, when Adrian Williams' family bought

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:52.080
the fishery some while before...

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.880
I can't remember what year.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:59.880
And yes, I've got pictures of him with the putches.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:12.520
And of course, the Howells used to work for the fishing, whoever owned it.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.520
I can remember old Mr. Howells making the putches even.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.520
Really?

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:24.840
If I went down, sometimes you'd see him out on the shingle or in front of the shed, there,

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.240
making the putches.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.240
Monica will tell you more about that.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:34.240
I've got lots of pictures of him doing it.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:41.880
Yes, it was part of, again, part of our village life, that everybody in the village had salmon,

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.640
if you could afford to buy it.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.640
It wasn't a problem.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.840
So you call it the Moors to you, Sue?

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.240
Yes, you live on the Moors.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.240
Live on the Moors.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.640
So we have the Caldecott and the Wentlewg levels.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:04.440
Do you feel a connection with the Wentlewg side at all?

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:09.360
Only because we know some of the farmers through young farmers.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:14.520
And again, we went to school with some of the farmers' daughters because they were just

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.520
close to the convent.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.920
And again, they'd all come there if they failed the lemblers.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.760
I think, I don't know what there was about farmers' daughters.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.280
But that's what happened.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:30.280
So we knew them through that, probably through markets and things like that.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.280
But no, there's no real connection.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:42.280
And when we did Flood 400 in 2007, we got together with St. Bride's Church and sort

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:52.800
visited and encouraged the commitment between us to do exhibitions.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.800
And that's about where it finishes.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.800
So you married.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.800
When did you marry?

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.800
1964.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.800
1964.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.800
Did you get married at Nush?

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.800
Yes.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.800
And so then you started your married life here at Whipson.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.800
Yes.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:17.320
So your husband's family at Longtime Whipson, Bessargeant, is that right?

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.320
Yes.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.320
Yeah.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.320
And so are you able to tell me some of their stories?

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320
Oh, yeah.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.320
Yes.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:33.320
Well, we're pretty sure this house, the barn especially, was built by the monks because

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:39.320
they had a grange and a moor barn, which is over on the common.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.840
And these were the two biggest barns built down here.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:51.840
And we know the monks owned all this area when they settled.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:41:02.840
So the next thing we know for sure is that in the 1600s, David's mother's family were

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.840
living here.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.840
And their name was Keane.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:17.360
And we have their wills, copies of their wills, to prove where they were.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:22.360
And they also owned land, which was extraordinary at that time.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.360
They were yeoman farmers.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.360
And it wasn't just this place.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:34.360
They lived in, they were a huge family, and they lived in most of the farm houses in the

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.360
villages.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.880
And I can trace exactly where.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:47.880
Now, we know the Wartyces were here, I think it's 1500.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:55.880
Neville's daughter, Catherine, she and I worked together on family history.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:02.880
And there is something that tells us they were here at that time.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:12.400
And it's quite likely when people's surnames were given them from the area and their livelihood,

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.400
that they were connected with the water somehow or other.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:32.400
Then, looking back, the Wartyces originally, David's great, great, great, great, great,

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.920
great, great, great, great's grandfather lived at Castle Farm in Bishden.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.920
And this was in the 1700s.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.920
I must have put my other book.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.920
He, he'd been to market to sell cattle.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:54.920
On his way back to Castle Farm at Bishden, he was killed by a highwayman, and his money

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.920
was all stolen.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:06.440
So, we know that, again, they were in this area, and then they moved into Nash.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:11.000
But the other side of the family were Joneses of Tatton, and they'd been here again for

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.240
many hundreds of years.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:21.520
I've got, you know, in the church registers, we can only go back to about 1750, 1760, and

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.920
they're all in there.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:31.920
And I've done a family tree, which tells me who, who's descended from whom, where, and

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.920
when.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:38.880
And that is encompassing the three parishes, which would make sense because they had no

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.600
transport.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.200
But they had a lot of links.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:54.520
You can see the Morgans of Tridiga have signed some of their marriage things in the registers.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:04.640
There were the Baptisms, and there was another family, the Arneys and the Seys.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:11.440
They were all people who had land and could write, you see.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.720
This is where you learn a little bit about them because you see where there's a cross.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:20.200
You know that they haven't had the education that some of the families where they've signed

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.840
their names.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:31.840
And then I guess they had to move out of the villages if they wanted farms before their

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.120
fathers had given up.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.360
And that happened with David's grandfather.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:44.240
He went to St. Brides up at Magher.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:51.840
And when he got married and his children were born up there, and he was farming 600 and

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:58.880
something acres in the 1880s and 90s.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.160
It was tremendous.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:06.960
And then eventually when they were able to, they came back down to this village.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.840
So they just waited their time to come back to the village.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.160
And then they moved back here.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:21.520
I'm not sure about the 17, 1800s exactly who was here.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.600
It's on my list to do.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:29.800
But they came back here in 1907.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:37.920
And then the family, I think there was a slight gap.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:45.840
During the First World War, David's father and his brother went to war and left Neville's

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.000
father, his brother.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.240
And one brother died.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.600
And I think grandmother had an awful job to run the farm while the men were at war.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.600
Wasn't that unusual?

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.880
Because we're in the reserved occupation.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.880
In the Second World War.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:02.880
Yeah.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.560
Yeah, but no, this is the First World War.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.560
Oh, I see.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:06.560
Okay, yes.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:11.280
And they didn't have the sufficient men to run the place.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:19.240
So in 1919, just as the war came to a close, she sold up and went to a house they owned

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.720
down the bottom of the village, the Molens.

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:31.800
And it wasn't then David's father came out of the war and he had no farm.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.400
So what happened then?

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:42.500
Monmouthshire County Council decided they'd let the soldiers have small holdings.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:48.880
So he managed to get a small holding up at Crick as an ex-soldier.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:47:00.360
I read my mother-in-law in Irene Green in 1924 and they farmed there for 10 years.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:05.600
And this place came back on the market.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:14.000
So they came back home because he'd lived here for 25 or 20 something years as a young

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
man.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
That's amazing.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
So, yes.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.560
So what year did they return?

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:25.120
1934 they came back here.

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:32.840
And it wasn't until 1942 they could buy it when it went for sale because the Agricultural

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:40.080
Mortgage Corporation had received it from a farmer who went into liquidation and they

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:44.200
owned it for 10 years, I think.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:50.480
And anyway, it was bought back and we've been here ever since.

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:56.640
So I get a feeling sometimes about it.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:02.320
David's grandmother living here with all her children and they only had one daughter and

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.120
five sons.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:09.640
And I knew Auntie Kathleen quite well and she lived here as a child.

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:17.200
And I still almost feel a presence in the house of a kind of warmth.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:25.240
And there's an awful lot of people who have come in this house and have felt how welcoming

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.240
it can be.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.240
Thanks for that.

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.240
It's really welcoming.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.320
It's like coming home in the way.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.240
And I like that feeling and it gives me great comfort.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.500
And David said he never wants to move.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:41.140
And I can understand why because I love it as much as he does.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:44.900
Well, you're very welcoming too though, aren't you?

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:49.300
And I love the idea that coming in and tea and biscuits done properly.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.820
I love all that.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:52.820
It is.

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.660
It's almost like a ceremonial.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.500
It's how we grew up, you see.

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.540
My mother was like it.

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:02.140
And it came through a lot, I think.

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:05.260
Yes, and David's mother.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:11.060
This is something about the village people.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:14.220
They were always pleased to see somebody come.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:19.100
And I can remember my mother used to feed the tramps and the people used to be in the

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.180
village who had very little.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:23.660
She always helped people.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:26.460
And I suppose it stays with you, doesn't it?

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.460
I think it does.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.460
I think it's ingrained, isn't it?

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:32.860
So is this one of the oldest houses on the level?

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:33.860
We think so.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:40.980
I have seen it in a history book when it was called G-R-A-I-N-G-E, which would have been

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:45.660
the Monks' Grange, you see.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.900
And of course they built it in stages.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.900
It wasn't like this.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.340
I mean it was a long house.

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:56.420
And the barn was obviously the first built.

00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:06.780
And then there was a stable attached to it with a living quarters above.

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:12.140
And the little room, we think the back of the house was attached to it, a single, probably

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.460
a single story to start with.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.340
And it's three stories now.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:19.940
And when we had a new roof put on the house you could see where it had been hired and

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:20.940
hired.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:21.940
Oh really?

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.780
And that's why we've got three stories at the back.

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.340
And two in the front.

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:31.340
Have you ever found anything while being on the farm, anything that indicates its age?

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:43.300
No, well the only thing that I was looking back, there were gravestones in the barn where

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:47.020
they used to do the winnowing.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:50.660
And also a squint window within.

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:55.420
And I wondered if there was some sort of chapel.

00:50:55.420 --> 00:51:01.380
And when we converted the barn I meant to rub the gravestones.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:05.980
And I didn't do it and the builders had the stones up and gone before I could.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.700
And oh I regret that so badly.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:13.060
A number of times I said I must go out.

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.900
And there's a yew tree in the garden.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:18.100
There's no other yew trees in this village except in Whitsun Churchyard.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.100
Really?

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.460
That's curious isn't it?

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:24.700
I'd love to know how old it is.

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:30.140
And I wondered if there was a single cell here for a monk.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.140
Or a hermitage I'm thinking.

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.140
Yes.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.140
I don't know.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.060
It does make me wonder.

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:44.220
And as time went on of course they built the house bigger and more impressive I guess than

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.180
a longhouse.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:54.860
My father-in-law told us that, or told David, that the back of the house was the front originally

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.980
facing the sea, facing the sun.

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:03.780
And this garden here where the cedar tree was the orchard.

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.820
And there's still a pear tree on the back drive.

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:06.820
Is there really?

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:07.820
Yes.

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:13.020
So would it have the drive sweeping round maybe?

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:18.700
We don't know because we think the building, our dairy and old kitchen, are built on what

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.820
was originally Wainbridge Lane.

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:21.820
Really?

00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:23.420
Wainbridge Lane was there.

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:26.660
There's still part of it down there and still part up there.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.660
Yeah.

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:30.940
And we've still got the old stones where the bridges would have been.

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:31.940
So where did it go?

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:35.420
Well it would have gone from the monastery you see up to Llanwerne.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.420
Oh goodness.

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:37.420
It's a direct...

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:38.420
Yeah.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:39.420
Let me show you on the map.

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.420
Gosh.

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.180
Now, if we're here...

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.180
Yeah.

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.180
It started...

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.860
Well there's the monastery.

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.740
It would have come up.

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:54.060
There's the lane, look.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.420
And it goes behind Pilfarm.

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.420
Up here, past...

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:04.340
Where am I now?

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.340
Past us.

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:10.020
So it comes up here and it went past our house.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.020
Up here.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.380
And we built that house there.

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.380
Yeah.

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.060
And it comes out the other side of it.

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:19.420
And then that road went straight on up to Llanwerne Lane.

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:21.180
Well has there ever been any work done on it?

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.780
I mean archaeological work on it, on the lane?

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:24.780
No.

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:25.780
No.

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:26.780
Well where's Monk Stitch?

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:27.780
Right along it.

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.780
Well that's curious, isn't it?

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:30.780
Yeah.

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:31.780
Oh.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:37.740
People don't seem to understand how important these green lanes once were.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.220
They were the original routes.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.220
Really?

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:41.420
The road here.

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:45.900
David's father in his lifetime remembers them making this road.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.900
Putting the...

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:47.900
The one outside?

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:48.900
Yeah.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.340
Putting the... breaking the rocks up to make it.

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:52.340
Really?

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:53.820
Oh yes.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:59.260
So they would have mostly used green lanes to travel around the village and footpaths.

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:00.260
Footpaths everywhere.

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.260
What about footpaths?

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:02.260
There are lots of footpaths.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:03.260
Oh, tremendous lot.

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.100
And we've got a couple going through here.

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.380
Do they have names?

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.380
No.

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.620
Not specific names.

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:21.660
So yes, so going back to the family, as they all had a lot of sons, so whenever a farm

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:27.980
was available they normally bought it or got tenancy of it, whichever.

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:34.660
And I could pinpoint on here, they lived at nearly every one.

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:35.660
Really?

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:36.660
Yes.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:43.420
And the Patton Farm was David's other part of the family on his grandmother's side.

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:52.740
And they lived farm field and then the waters lived here, there, there, there.

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:56.860
You know, and you virtually looked at them all and knew family were there.

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.300
Do you have names of fields at all?

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:00.300
Oh yes.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:04.060
Now this is another project I started in my book.

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:05.060
Yeah?

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.060
Yes, all our fields and I've taught the children and the grandchildren the names of all the

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.060
fields here.

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.060
Yeah.

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:13.060
A lot of them are obvious.

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.060
Yeah.

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:21.780
But the one that interested me most was reading about the history of villages.

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:27.820
Every village had a north field, which was north of the church.

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:33.180
And we own a north field, which is north of the church.

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.780
And that fascinated me.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:35.780
Yeah.

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:43.620
So, ours are basically mundane, but at home we had the Crowners field.

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.780
I don't know why it was called the Crowners.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:52.460
Obviously you had a pylon field and you had a shed field.

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.460
Yeah.

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:55.300
And we've got a moutpen.

00:55:55.300 --> 00:56:00.980
Now that's called the moutpen because they used to have the mows in there, the hay mows.

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.980
The hay mows?

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:04.580
Yeah, M-O-W-S, mow.

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:05.580
What's that?

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:06.580
A rick.

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:09.580
I've never heard it called that before.

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:10.580
Oh.

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:18.060
Well, they used to make ricks of hay when you gathered it in loose, long before balers

00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.060
obviously.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:22.060
And make it into that sort of shape.

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:27.780
Yes, and you'd thatch the top virtually and you'd have perhaps six or eight of those and

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.780
we call them the mows.

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:29.780
I don't know who it was of mine.

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:30.780
All right.

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:31.780
Perhaps this local.

00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:33.580
Okay.

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:38.580
So did you thatch the top with, how did you thatch the top?

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:39.580
I don't remember.

00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:45.780
Because somebody was telling me that they used to go off on this bike to buy bundles.

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.780
Oh, bundles of reeds.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:49.780
Yeah, to thatch the top of the rick.

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.780
Yeah, well there's reeds growing all around here.

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:57.780
Has there always been reeds growing in the reeds here?

00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:02.780
I don't remember them when I was a child and David says they've colonised the place.

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:05.660
So we don't quite know where they've colonised us from.

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:10.940
But we didn't have the trouble casting the reams that we have now because they've certainly

00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:17.460
increased over, whether it's because we've stopped using fertilisers, I don't know.

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:18.460
Could be.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:25.780
So do you as a farmer down here Sue, what are the challenges or the delights?

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:31.780
So, you know, I think that the drainage, the grips, that sort of thing that maybe a farmer

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:33.780
elsewhere wouldn't have to deal with.

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:46.780
Well, over my life for farming, 55 years now, when I came here, yes, there were grips in

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:48.980
all the fields.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:56.980
And then you had to consider the cost of draining your land to get rid of these grips.

00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:04.980
So, we put under drainage in, we ploughed and we reseeded nearly the entire farm.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.980
Why did you get rid of the grips?

00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:13.980
Well, when you're farming and you've got, the machinery was improving and if you were

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:18.980
mowing a field, the difficulty of mowing these grips was incredible.

00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:25.980
I'd have to go and rake back as David was mowing and they would break the machinery

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:33.980
because you'd go down and there were verus, you see, all the fields had verus.

00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:39.980
So, you just needed to have flat fields for all your crops.

00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:44.980
It made it easier for harvesting, made it easier for everything.

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.980
We filled in blind ditches.

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:54.980
There were often blind ditches where nothing had been done for centuries, you see.

00:58:54.980 --> 00:59:01.980
And that mean you were then by flattening the fields?

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:02.980
Yes.

00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:06.980
What did you have to do a lot then with making alternative drainage?

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:09.980
No, because you put an under drainage system in.

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:11.980
That must have been massive.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:17.980
Well, it was because they would come with loads of gravel and then put the pipes.

00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:18.980
Gosh.

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:23.980
And then, yes, it cost us a great deal of money, but in those days they also gave you

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:26.980
grants towards it.

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:30.980
In the 60s they were handing grants out because they were so short of food.

00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.980
They wanted us to become efficient.

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.980
And that's what we did.

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:40.980
And we were building our dairy herd up, which was very necessary to be as efficient

00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:42.980
as you possibly could.

00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:47.980
And so, are there farms down here that still use that sort of system, the grip system?

00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:49.980
Very few, very few.

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:55.980
There's a couple I know of, but most farmers had to do exactly the same as us

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.980
and get rid of them.

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:03.980
And this was the one thing that happened during the takeover for the wetlands.

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:10.980
Neville and some of the other farmers, John Waters and a few of them, they'd

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:18.980
under drained all their land and they were growing wheat, which is not so usual for

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.980
this part of the world because of the dampness.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.980
But once you've drained, you see you can grow any crop.

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:29.980
And he'd done, oh, acres and acres of land down that way.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:35.980
And when it was compulsory purchased and he saw them breaking up the drainage system

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.980
that he'd put in, it's enough to break your heart.

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:42.980
But of course, that didn't matter to them, did it?

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:48.980
And I think that was one of the heartbreaking things about everything coming to our

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.980
village.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:54.980
It didn't matter what any farmer did, it was taken off them.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.980
The steelworks took, what, 1500, 1800 acres?

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.980
That's a big piece of land.

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:05.980
Was that a shock when that came and the size of it and the scale of it?

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:17.980
Well, I think what really made us sit up after was in 1953, Electric came to

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.980
Whitsun and Goldcliffe.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:20.980
1953?

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.980
Yeah, Whitsun, Goldcliffe and Nash.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:29.980
But there were several houses that weren't offered it, like Newhouse, Greencourt,

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:33.980
Tatton, quite a few of them.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:35.980
And that was in 1953.

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:39.980
Well, 1958, they announced the steelworks was coming.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:44.980
And of course, it made sense because they were being bulldozed down anyway.

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:50.980
So they knew six years in advance of us that it was going to, it was earmarked.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:56.980
So, you know, we had before that been told that Whitsun was going to build

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.980
factories here.

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:06.980
But because it was very, very poor land, it was virtually bogged because it was

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:11.980
the area where what we call the bottoms, where before the wall was built for the

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:17.980
sea, the water would come over, run down into the bottoms, as we called it,

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.980
fill it up, and of course it couldn't get back out.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.980
So it was just full of old rush.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:23.980
Yeah.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:28.980
Whether it could have been with modern farming methods made more productive, we

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.980
do not know.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.980
But it was an ideal site for them.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:36.980
But what we didn't realize how far it would encroach into our village and take

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:43.980
away railway stations, our lanes, our roads, our access to other villages.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:46.980
So which station did it take away?

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:51.980
Clan Wern was the main one because it was one mile from here.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:56.980
And David always rode his bike there to catch his train to school in Newport.

01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:03.980
And all the, during the First World War and previous to that, the trains would draw

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.980
up there and all the feed for the animals would come into the village.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.980
The coal would come into the village.

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:17.980
David said his father would take his horse and cart up and collect all the coal for

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.980
the winter.

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:24.980
They sent all the fodder for the ponies in the First World War out by train.

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:25.980
Really?

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.980
From here?

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.980
Yes, from the whole of the villages.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.980
So it was very, very important.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:31.980
Yeah.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:36.980
And was it just a small village as well, Clan Wern, was it?

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:37.980
Yes, yes.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.980
I haven't got it on there.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:44.980
But yes, I mean, it's not, it wasn't a lot bigger than what it is now, but of course

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:46.980
they're expanding it.

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.980
But it was a main archery for this area.

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:54.980
Because we people didn't want to go to Newport if you had one one mile up the road.

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.980
Yeah.

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:56.980
So they went.

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.980
Oh, yes.

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:04.980
There was a mile of road and they just took it away, built all sorts of things over it

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.980
and then took the end of the village off.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:13.980
They took all the green name system out, the whole lot where we'd, you know, have gone

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.980
from one area to another.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:16.980
Yeah.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:22.980
And knocked some of the most beautiful farm houses down in the process.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.980
So yes.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.980
And people wonder when we are protective of our area.

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:33.980
This is why this living levels is suddenly bringing, it's almost 50 years too late.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.980
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:46.980
Why, oh why did they constantly want our villages when it was such a beautiful little area?

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.980
It wasn't beauty by the standards of the Cotswold villages or anything like that.

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.980
It's got its own beauty though, hasn't it?

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:55.980
It had something special about it.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:00.980
But the minute they started putting dozens of modern houses into it, it lost its character

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.980
as far as I was concerned.

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:08.980
So was there was a mixed feeling towards Langwurming because it bought work, didn't it?

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:09.980
Yes.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:16.980
But of course then, although it brought work, it doubled Newport, the size of Newport.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.980
It made it less of an attractive town.

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:27.980
We had caravan sites put, our schools filled up and they were plonked in the centre of

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:28.980
the village.

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.980
And I can remember the school was overwhelmed.

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:32.980
Really?

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:35.980
Yeah, they had to put another part of the school into being.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.980
Which is Nash School?

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:38.980
Yes.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.980
They had to bring in what you call portable buildings.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:41.980
Oh really?

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:42.980
Yes.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:48.980
Because somebody told me that at High Cornwall there was a camp there for Irish Navvies.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:50.980
Yes, that's it.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.980
Yes, they all came over and looked to work.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:56.980
But they had to have a place to send their children to school.

01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.980
So we got it.

01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:04.980
And then there was another camp put there for experimental something or other to do

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:05.980
the steelworks.

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:06.980
I forgot what they called it.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:11.980
And that's just an overgrown field now.

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:13.980
Nobody could even get in there, I doubt.

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.980
So did you feel the effects here?

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.980
What sort of changes did you feel?

01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:21.980
The worst was going to school.

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:27.980
And we would catch the bus to go to school.

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:34.980
And within ten minutes of being on the bus, the bus would be stationary and crawling

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:38.980
for an hour and we would miss our convent bus.

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:45.980
So you got out of the bus after three miles and you walked the other two to get your bus.

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:50.980
Because there were so many shale lorries and we only had one bridge in Newport.

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:51.980
Of course.

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.980
The main bridge next to the railway bridge.

01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:59.980
And it was totally snarled up.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.980
So they decided they'd built George Street Bridge.

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:08.980
But of course it was too late for the use of the ship, you know, to stop all this happening.

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:17.980
And that was a horrible feeling that everything started to change.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.980
And we had no control whatsoever.

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:25.980
And there was no previous thought of the infrastructure at all.

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:30.980
So you must have been delighted with the news of the implore coming through?

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.980
This time?

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.980
I don't think it made a lot of difference to us.

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:41.980
Obviously it would have been half a mile or more away and we wouldn't have wanted it.

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:44.980
But I do think Newport needs help.

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:52.980
Because I don't think people fully realize what a problem Newport has.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:56.980
I wish they'd find some solution to it.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:04.980
I don't think also that the people who were against it coming for the habitat and so forth

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.980
fully realize that we have had this happen so many times.

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:15.980
With the power station, with the ash ponds, Llanwerne.

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.980
The habitat has been eroded in those areas.

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:26.980
But the wildlife will move around and they will, you know, thrive wherever.

01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:34.980
Because we have found that with the fact that we had, from farming very intensively

01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:37.980
and all the slurry we used to put on the land.

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:40.980
We didn't have a lot of wildlife at that time.

01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:46.980
But since, we have got far more wildlife here than you ever see down the wetlands.

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:49.980
That's curious really.

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:51.980
It is.

01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:55.980
We always had a heronry on the farm.

01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:00.980
Herons, swans, ducks, owls, every type of bird.

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.980
Hairs.

01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.980
And you know, they're thriving.

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:13.980
We've had fields of lapwings and the swans are with us and have them young every year.

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:17.980
But then they've been here for the last, you know, ever since I came.

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:24.980
Because you read some stories, people compare this to the Amazon for its, you know, diversity.

01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:25.980
Yeah.

01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:35.980
But I can't see, as far as I'm concerned, everything has come back that once didn't thrive perhaps

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:38.980
where we were farming intensively.

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:40.980
And it's all come back.

01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:44.980
I mean, how many people can hear the owls in their trees at night?

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.980
And we've got them on the farm.

01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:54.980
No, there's nothing, you know, I've got wild ducks that come in the garden.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:59.980
And every year you see the swans teaching the signets to fly up our orchard.

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:00.980
Delight.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.980
It's amazing.

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:13.980
So, no, I find it difficult to believe that it's the same when they lock the gates at the wetlands.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:16.980
You mustn't walk through there whilst the birds are breeding.

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:22.980
How do they think farming works when we are making haze, silage?

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:27.980
I can walk through one of the fields and you'll hear the birds singing and they'll go quiet.

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:31.980
But you know they've got young or eggs in there or whatever.

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:35.980
But they'll fly back in as soon as you've gone.

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:44.980
I mean, that must seem kind of strange, people around here, to be told it's almost as if you don't know your land or how nature works.

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:45.980
Yes.

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:48.980
And you've got some experts coming in saying you'd better listen to us.

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.980
That must be a bit frustrating.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.980
Oh, it is terribly frustrating.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:11:02.980
And I found that really, really hard down the seawall where we've gone all our lives to walk where we wanted to go and suddenly you've got padlocks.

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:10.980
And I would get over the gates and take no notice because I was thinking I know more about it than what they do.

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:13.980
But then they put barbed wire and you can't do that.

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.980
And you think this is absolutely dreadful.

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:24.980
Do they think that wildlife takes any notice of human beings?

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:25.980
They don't.

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.980
We've coexisted for so long, haven't we?

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:28.980
Yes.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.980
It's respecting one group over another, isn't it, really?

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:42.980
And perhaps you've been able to glean a picture a little bit of how anxious I have felt through my life that they're going to take more and more of us.

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:43.980
Yeah.

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:45.980
And destroy what was here.

01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:46.980
Yeah.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:52.980
Well, I think it's obvious why you would be anxious about that because so much has been taken, hasn't it, really?

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.980
I'm very anti-development.

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:57.980
Well, you've seen enough of it to be anti-it, haven't you?

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:58.980
Yes.

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:02.980
Yet there is an idyll here still, isn't there, I feel, when I come to...

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:11.980
Well, I find it more in Whitsun than I do in Nash because I lost that idyll a long time ago when they built all around our house.

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:24.980
But I'm already incredibly aware that you're a very modest woman, but you've done some fantastic work recording history locally.

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:27.980
Why have you taken it upon yourself to do that?

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:34.980
And what things have you learnt and researched that have thrilled you or amazed you or whatever?

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:39.980
I... It's a job to define.

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:47.980
I don't know why I suddenly became... I used to always listen to the old people.

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:52.980
I used to like sitting quiet and taking it all in, so to speak.

01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:56.980
My father used to say, oh, she's got her ears flapping again.

01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.980
And they were right.

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:03.980
We had an old gentleman who used to come to the house.

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:07.980
He lived up the road, Mr. Lamprey.

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:12.980
And he was bristly and he used to ride his bike down.

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:18.980
And he loved coming to see my mother and he'd sit in the rocking chair while she was cooking or doing something.

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.980
And he was a herbalist.

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:21.980
Herbalist?

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:22.980
Yes.

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.980
And he'd come and he'd say now, I think...

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:30.980
And in those days everybody called Mrs. This or Mr. That.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:32.980
Now Mrs. Collymore.

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:38.980
I've brought you some nettles today and perhaps if I tell you how we'll make some nettle soup.

01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.980
I don't know where my mother wished him to.

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:47.980
But he never stopped coming and he always had some ideas about...

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.980
That used to fascinate me.

01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:52.980
I don't know.

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:57.980
There was things I used to take on board, I guess.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:06.980
And then suddenly I thought, well, I used to say to the old people, will you tell me or will you talk?

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:10.980
Like Mr. German, who was the local blacksmith.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:16.980
His memories went way back, probably to the beginning of the century.

01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:21.980
I think he must have been born about 1912 or something like that.

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:26.980
And now what do you want to know, my dear?

01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:31.980
Things like that used to happen and I didn't record it.

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:34.980
I just remember some of it.

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:38.980
And we had an old gentleman, Andrew Greenhouse, who lived opposite us here.

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.980
He knew everything and I didn't record it.

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:47.980
So at one stage I thought, you see, when I was farming I had an awfully busy life.

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.980
Running this place, I had children.

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.980
I used to work for Cruz Bereavement Care, 20 hours a week.

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.980
And that was voluntary.

01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:01.980
I used to help run the church.

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:09.980
And we were a big family, always visiting somebody in the family who needed something or other.

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:13.980
My mother became very ill and I had to look after her.

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:16.980
There was an awful lot going on.

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:20.980
And it wasn't probably until 2000.

01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:30.980
I used to help my girls run their businesses because one was a ceramicist and the other made clothes and whatever.

01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:36.980
So there was all that going on and the cows, which took most of our life up.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:46.980
And I started writing my book of my life story, thinking, well, this would be nice for the grandchildren

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:52.980
to know a little bit about when I used to say we had no hot water in the house.

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:56.980
We didn't have a bathroom. We didn't have electric.

01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:57.980
And this was our life.

01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:59.980
And my word, we were happy.

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.980
It never made any difference to us.

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:05.980
My mother created a wonderful home with very little.

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:13.980
My father and mother worked hard with the business to afford to pay for the four of us to go to private school,

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:19.980
which must, looking back, have been a great sacrifice for them.

01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:22.980
But they thought maybe it would do us good.

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:31.980
There was all sorts of things that made me realize that we had a different life to other people.

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:41.980
And I guess I started writing it down because my own family, it was such a large family,

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:49.980
all very interesting people who did things that you didn't hear about other people doing.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.980
So you've written that, have you Sue?

01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.980
Not all of it. No, no, nothing like.

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.980
I've got quite a few chapters under my belt.

01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:01.980
But I want to do the detail, you see, and that's what takes the time.

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:06.980
And then as soon as you think of something, then you're reminded of something else, I'm sure.

01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:09.980
You just can't encompass it all.

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.980
It's in exhaustive, isn't it, just trying to get it all done.

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.980
Yes. And then we're coming from generation to generation.

01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:23.980
But mostly I wanted to write about my farming life and how it evolved

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:28.980
because it saw huge differences from beginning to end like my father did.

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:38.980
Yeah. So you have taken it upon yourself to maybe record your community.

01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:40.980
Oh, yes. My community is in my book.

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:47.980
All the people, who they were, what they did and how we lived.

01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:50.980
Who was Hubert Jones?

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:56.980
Hubert Jones. Well, you see, his family, the Joneses, I don't know how far they go back,

01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:59.980
but I know it's hundreds of years.

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:08.980
And again, they had their own land.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:12.980
So if people had their own land, they stayed.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:17.980
He was one of several boys.

01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:20.980
I don't quite know how many.

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:23.980
His daughter, Lynn, lives in Redwick,

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:27.980
and she gave me access to all his papers that he'd written.

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:35.980
And he had been writing his history since I would think he was about 30 or 40.

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:40.980
So his memories went right back to the beginning of the 1900s.

01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:45.980
And he sketched. He would go.

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:52.980
He didn't drive, but he would go by bus into the library and he would order books.

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:57.980
And they always sent them by post so that he would read his book

01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:01.980
and then correspond with the head librarian, send them back.

01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:09.980
So everything he wrote or copied, rather, to do with the history was factual.

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:13.980
He didn't do a bibliography as such,

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:20.980
but he wrote down which book it had come out of so that I know that it's not fiction.

01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:24.980
And then he was writing, and I can show you.

01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:36.980
I have written stuff myself, which has copied down a lot of his memories.

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:45.980
This is what's fascinated me, what he can tell us.

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:53.980
You see, there's Broad Street Common in the parish of Goukli,

01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:57.980
and the land was once part of the estate of the College of Eden.

01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:01.980
Now, his diction wasn't terribly good.

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:09.980
He was not terribly good at putting words into sentences, if you know what I mean.

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:19.980
And he was very clever, but I've sort of rewritten what he had done

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:24.980
so that it makes perhaps a little more sense to people listening these days.

01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:28.980
It would have made more sense to him at the time when he was writing it.

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:32.980
And here he's like, I remember.

01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:37.980
So everything's I remember.

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:39.980
And this was the fascinating bit.

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.980
I'll just read the first bit.

01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:50.980
I remember there had been talk of a large docks being built on the Nash side of the River Usk.

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:57.980
However, it did not materialize as the 1914-18 War changed everything,

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:01.980
putting an end to all the dreams of new prosperity.

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:07.980
And there had long been speculation before of another railway line from Seven Tunnel

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:11.980
across the Caldecott levels to the mouth of the Usk.

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:14.980
However, this idea did not come to fruition,

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:19.980
and many people who had speculated on the project burnt their fingers.

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:25.980
And it goes on then to explain who it was and how they'd got it.

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:28.980
What a fantastic document.

01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:33.980
And then, yes, and there are names like the Brewer Williams,

01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:36.980
and they're connected to David's family.

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:40.980
And I know where they fit into the history in Newport.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.980
Wow.

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:47.980
And yes, there's all these names.

01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.980
And the thing is, I knew these people.

01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.980
Yeah, you can make the connections, can't you?

01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:52.980
Yes.

01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:54.980
And you can also give them context.

01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:59.980
I know who they married, who their families were.

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:00.980
And if that...

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:03.980
You're going to have to do a huge wall chart, aren't you,

01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:08.980
with all these, you know, locations and then family trees associated with them.

01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:09.980
Yes.

01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:13.980
The interesting thing was when I was doing the soldiers,

01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:19.980
and I think there were 70 or more or less, for the exhibition,

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:23.980
I found it fascinating when I looked back into their past,

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:29.980
how this went round and round in circles,

01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:32.980
all the intermarrying, because they couldn't go out of the village.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.980
They had kind of married into their community.

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:36.980
Oh, yes, yeah.

01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:39.980
And very often they were first or second cousins.

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:43.980
Yeah, it's just a wonder there weren't more problems locally.

01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.980
So what did Hubert do? Was he a farmer?

01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:51.980
Well, his father was, and some of his brothers were,

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.980
but he chose to work for the river board, you see.

01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:55.980
Really?

01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:59.980
So he was maintaining a lot of the waterways.

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:04.980
So he knew virtually everything that was going on locally.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:05.980
Did you ever meet him?

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.980
Oh, yes, I knew him. Not a lot.

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:12.980
But I remember him going round giving talks,

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:14.980
and people used to call him the local historian.

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:15.980
Really?

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:16.980
Yes.

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.980
It's almost like he's passed on the mantle to you.

01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:22.980
Well, I feel that he and I would have got on really well.

01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:23.980
Yeah.

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:30.980
Yes. I mean, this is a little bit about down on the wharf.

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:35.980
Who built the tavern? And this is the windbound.

01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:42.980
We do not know, as like its owners, it is lost in history and forgotten.

01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:46.980
It was a very old house. Now, I have a drawing of it.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:52.980
Nobody else has, but I've drawn it from a sketch he did.

01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:53.980
Yeah.

01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:57.980
When I knew it, yes, it was a very old house when I knew it,

01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:00.980
and was built possibly about 1700.

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:04.980
It was fairly isolated and was on its own,

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:09.980
but there would possibly have been a group of old fishermen's huts

01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:11.980
there sometime previously.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.980
It appeared to be in fairly good condition when I remember it.

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:18.980
Whitewashed with four largest rooms downstairs

01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:23.980
and two large bedrooms in the front, looking out across the river.

01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:26.980
And so it goes on.

01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:31.980
And Lyn Jones from Nash, her family lived there.

01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:32.980
Yeah.

01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:34.980
So why?

01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:40.980
So, and she didn't even know a lot of what I read at the meeting.

01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:41.980
Really?

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:42.980
Yeah.

01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:48.980
It's just fantastic document to have, but you have transcribed it.

01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:50.980
It's there for the record now, isn't it?

01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:51.980
Yes.

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:53.980
While it's being lost and thrown into some stick.

01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:58.980
Yeah, I was just wondering where I got to in the end.

01:24:58.980 --> 01:24:59.980
Yeah.

01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:04.980
Every, everything I've written is, and again,

01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:07.980
I don't know if you've heard of Dr. William Price.

01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:08.980
No.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:12.980
Well, he was the one that introduced cremation in this country.

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:13.980
No.

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.980
Oh, my word, you don't know anything if you don't know about Dr. William Price.

01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:18.980
Oh, my goodness.

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:22.980
But he was very, I wrote the history of the farmer's arms in Goldil.

01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:24.980
And he was very much connected to that.

01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:26.980
How was he connected to that?

01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:30.980
He used to come to the village and stay and he used to, he was a doctor.

01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:31.980
Yeah.

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:36.980
And he used to heal people and treat them free because they were poor.

01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:39.980
And he would stay in the farmer's arms.

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:40.980
Really?

01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:41.980
Yes.

01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:44.980
So, you know, I've written bits and pieces.

01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:46.980
Oh, my goodness me.

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:48.980
Yeah.

01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:50.980
Extraordinary stuff, Sue.

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:51.980
So.

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:52.980
Oh, my God.

01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:54.980
Look how lovely I've written.

01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:55.980
What gorgeous writing.

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:56.980
I don't know.

01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:58.980
I don't write at all like that.

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:04.980
When I'm writing, I just do, you know, free fall, as we call it,

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:09.980
and trying to write the history of Whitsun, the Philipses of Whitsun House.

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.980
Did you ever go there with the zoo?

01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:12.980
Oh, yes.

01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:15.980
Did you ever go there with your children?

01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:16.980
Oh, I was friendly with Mrs. Mabry.

01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:18.980
I used to spend a lot of time with her.

01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:19.980
Did you?

01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:20.980
She and I struck up a lovely friendship.

01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:21.980
Yeah.

01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:29.980
And she, yes, when the children were little, she had the zoo.

01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:31.980
So I would push them over in the push chair.

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:36.980
And I obviously sit by her and talk to her.

01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:37.980
She was interesting.

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:38.980
Yeah.

01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:43.980
And she, we could set up a conversation, again, a little bit about history.

01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:44.980
Yeah.

01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:47.980
And, yeah, we used to talk for a little.

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:52.980
And as the children grew up, she used to say, well, you come over whenever you want and bring your friends.

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:53.980
So they never had to pay.

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:59.980
And then as time went on, I would go and sit with her afternoons and keep her company.

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:02.980
And she'd make sure we had a lovely tea on the front or something.

01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:07.980
And, of course, she was a bit of a benefactress.

01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:13.980
So we used to have fundraising events for the church there.

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:18.980
And she'd say, right, you can have the house as long as you clean it before and after.

01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:19.980
So we did.

01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:23.980
And we had beautiful events there.

01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:28.980
And what was the motivation behind the zoo?

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:33.980
Well, somebody gave her one or two things to look after.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:34.980
And it just seemed to grow.

01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:36.980
People were always giving her things.

01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:44.980
And then eventually, I suppose she thought, well, I might just as well have a bit of a zoo.

01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:50.980
And she had local people who made cages and so forth.

01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:52.980
And it just grew.

01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:56.980
I can remember one night we had a church meeting there.

01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:59.980
And the lion was on the settee.

01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:06.980
And she said, well, will you wait a minute while I put the lion back in its cage?

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:08.980
That was quite funny.

01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:09.980
I mean, it's hello.

01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:14.980
Stopped by and she said, oh, she said, I've lost a snake.

01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.980
Have you seen it anywhere?

01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:20.980
I looked at her and I said, well, no, is it poisonous?

01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:25.980
Oh, no, she said, it crushes you to death.

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:27.980
That made us laugh.

01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:33.980
Thankfully, I don't know what, I'm sure they recaptured it or something.

01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:35.980
Could you hear the lions roaring?

01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:36.980
Yes, especially in the summer.

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:39.980
We'd have our windows up because we sleep in the front.

01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:45.980
And you'd have this roaring through the night because they didn't like the discomfort of the heat.

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:49.980
But I would have thought they would be bred into that.

01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:50.980
And peacocks.

01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:53.980
She always had peacocks and they'd scream as well.

01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:55.980
And monkeys as well.

01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:57.980
Yes, but we didn't hear the monkeys.

01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:59.980
It's hilarious, really.

01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:00.980
Yes.

01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:02.980
I'm very conscious.

01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:03.980
I've been here a long time.

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:05.980
Sorry, Sue. You're just so fascinating.

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:06.980
It doesn't matter.

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.980
Are you too young to remember the war?

01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:10.980
The war.

01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:11.980
Second World War.

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:14.980
Oh, yeah. I wasn't born till after it finished in 1945.

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:18.980
So do you remember the winter of 63?

01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:19.980
Oh, gosh, yes.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:20.980
Yes.

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:21.980
What was it like here?

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:22.980
Oh, horrendous.

01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:23.980
Horrendous.

01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:35.980
Here, well, and I remember especially the 83 one, and I took pictures and film of the 83 one here.

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:39.980
But 63, people couldn't move around.

01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:44.980
And it stayed from Boxing Day until March almost.

01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:48.980
And here especially, all the water froze.

01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:59.980
And they were trying to get specialist people to come and unfreeze the water under the pill and came in under the pill.

01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:03.980
Because that would have been particularly here.

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:08.980
Yes. The only water supply in the house, we had a huge water tank in the attic.

01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:14.980
And they would carry churns of water up there every day to fill it.

01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:20.980
And I think David had probably 50 head of cattle in the sheds.

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:24.980
And they drink, I don't know how many, 25 gallons a day.

01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:33.980
And they had to carry water from the pill, because it was a running stream, up to the sheds every day.

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:36.980
There was an Italian man working here at the time.

01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:45.980
And most of their day was taken up between milkings and just hauling water.

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.980
And it was cruel, you know.

01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:50.980
There was ice on every reen.

01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:51.980
Gosh.

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:57.980
You couldn't turn the cattle out anyway, which you wouldn't have done.

01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.980
So, oh no.

01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:04.980
David, he could talk for ages on that.

01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:05.980
It was horrendous.

01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:08.980
And the drought of 76, was that equally as bad?

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:10.980
Oh, terrible for us. Terrible.

01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:18.980
We always reared all our heifers, because heifers were very expensive to buy in 76.

01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:20.980
So we had about 23.

01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:26.980
Now, we would have had 70 or 80 cows at the time.

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:28.980
And there was no fodder in the winter.

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:30.980
In the summer there was no grass for them.

01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:34.980
And we had to feed straw, because it was the only thing we had.

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:38.980
We had to keep what hay we had for the winter feed.

01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:40.980
Was straw not a good thing to feed, Kathy?

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.980
No, it hurts their mouths.

01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:43.980
Oh, really? Yeah.

01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:46.980
So we went into silage in those days.

01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:48.980
It hadn't taken off.

01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:52.980
And we'd taken land all over the place.

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:58.980
We always had to buy 100 acres, very nearly, of grass keep, as we call it.

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:06.980
And we had some at Katzash, up at Harry Ross's.

01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:08.980
Oh, I don't know where else.

01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:09.980
We had some at Wilcric.

01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.980
We had some at Redwick.

01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:14.980
And our cattle were starving.

01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:16.980
We had to feed them straw.

01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:21.980
So you'd have to go all over the place with your trailer full of straw to feed these every day.

01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:27.980
And when it came to the time we had nothing left, we had to sell our heifers.

01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:29.980
Oh, God. It was that desperate?

01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:30.980
It was desperate.

01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:36.980
And I think our neighbor bought most of them in market.

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:40.980
And that set us back farming-wise for years.

01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:41.980
Oh, gosh.

01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:44.980
You know, because you have a three-year cycle with your heifer to cow.

01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:45.980
Yeah.

01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:47.980
We lost a lot of money.

01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:48.980
Yeah.

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:55.980
But there was no recompense for farmers who had lost money in any circumstances.

01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:57.980
So, yes.

01:32:57.980 --> 01:32:59.980
Foot and mouth were different crises then.

01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:02.980
Yes, foot and mouth didn't affect us here.

01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:06.980
I can remember we had all the signs up and we had disinfectant.

01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:10.980
There was one in 1966 we had.

01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:13.980
And that was a bit closer to us.

01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:17.980
But the 90 whatever one didn't affect us.

01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:19.980
At all.

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:23.980
Sorry, Sue. I'll bring it to an end very soon.

01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:24.980
You'll be delighted to hear.

01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:25.980
I just wondered about...

01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.980
Oh, I'm loving it.

01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:27.980
Oh, are you?

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:29.980
Oh, good, because I am too.

01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:34.980
Newport. Would you consider Newport to be part of the levels?

01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:37.980
No, not from Liswery onwards.

01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:45.980
Once the land starts to rise at Liswery towards Summerton, towards Chepster Road, the land rises.

01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:49.980
No. Up as far as Summerton.

01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:55.980
And you can imagine it's got its name from the fact that it was the summer grazing grounds.

01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:59.980
It doesn't look like spelling the same.

01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:11.980
But David will tell you his father remembers that farmed right up as far as what we call Corporation Road where the bridges are.

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:12.980
And they go over.

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.980
And that would have been flat up to there.

01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:22.980
And that would have been levels going back 150 years.

01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:29.980
So no, we wouldn't consider...

01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:35.980
Once we get up through Liswery, we don't think of it any longer as being part of the Moors as we called it.

01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:39.980
So was Newport the place where you would go shopping or livestock market?

01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:41.980
Oh, yes, yes.

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:45.980
The fresh fruit and veg market?

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:51.980
Oh, definitely. On a Wednesday, the farmers would go to market.

01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:54.980
Their wives didn't drive, so the wives went.

01:34:54.980 --> 01:35:00.980
And I remember all my aunts who were farmers' wives who had all meeting Newport.

01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:06.980
Every shop, every building was a shop with something that people needed.

01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:10.980
And the market was a hive of industry.

01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:14.980
Griffin Street, where our shop was, was alive with shops.

01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:17.980
And people could park anywhere.

01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:23.980
I remember we used to park outside the town hall where the clock was because the bank was next door.

01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:26.980
I remember feeding the babies in the car.

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:30.980
We used to take hot water flasks to feed.

01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:34.980
And you met everybody. You bumped into people.

01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:38.980
There was every type of business you could imagine.

01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:47.980
Expensive jewellery shops, beautiful cafes, all with different character of their own.

01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:54.980
And you always had a second story like the Cardoma where you could look down into the street and see what's around.

01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:59.980
Beautiful dress shops, lovely stores.

01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:08.980
I can remember one shop EG Taylor where they had a machine that took your money and it flew right across the shop on a chain.

01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:16.980
And it came out the other end and then you had to change back and unscrew these little pots and your money would be in it.

01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:24.980
So, yeah, beautiful shoe shops, wonderful tailors, bespoke tailors as well.

01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:30.980
I can remember my father having his coats made with this bespoke tailor and his shoes.

01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:34.980
He used to wear britches up to his knees.

01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:37.980
Britches, no, what do you call them?

01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:38.980
Leggings.

01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:40.980
Leggings up to the top of his britches.

01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:41.980
That wood button.

01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:42.980
Yes, that's it.

01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:45.980
He used to wear those and sports coats he'd have made.

01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:48.980
Yellow waistcoats.

01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:52.980
And my mother used to have her suits tailored.

01:36:52.980 --> 01:37:00.980
Oh yes, Newport was alive and gorgeous properties like the town hall and the library and everything.

01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:02.980
And they just knocked it all down.

01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:10.980
And the Lyceum Theatre with these wonderful structure with all these pillars, a bit like Covent Garden, the Opera House.

01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:19.980
And I can remember my mother taking me to pantomimes there and seeing ice skating on ice in those days.

01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:24.980
There were music halls, there were dance places.

01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:28.980
It was just wonderful.

01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:38.980
And we used to have a carnival and we'd be taken in and you'd sit on the windows of the bank or something and wait for the carnival to go past.

01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:40.980
It was huge.

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:47.980
But the population of Newport wouldn't have been any more than about 25,000 in those days, maybe 30.

01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:49.980
And now we're looking at 100 and not 1000.

01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:51.980
It sounds like it was a thriving place.

01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:52.980
Oh it was.

01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:56.980
But you had lots of industry and the docks were huge then too, weren't they?

01:37:56.980 --> 01:38:03.980
Yes, there was industry down there and of course there was Lysats and all the other places, all of that.

01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:13.980
But the farmers would stand market Fridays and Saturdays and the market, at the top of the market you had this huge floor

01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:19.980
where all the farmers would have their chicken and their produce, their butter and their cream all the way round.

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:27.980
And our shop was absolutely thriving in Griffin Street because people could pull up outside the market opposite the shop.

01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:31.980
We had mobile shops that used to go around the villages on a Tuesday.

01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:32.980
Oh really?

01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:39.980
They would deliver all the meat on a Saturday for people's roasts in all the villages.

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:43.980
So all my aunts and uncles worked in this business.

01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:48.980
So it was one of the bigger butchers' shops in Newport.

01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:57.980
And yes, and I was told many stories by many people that during the war,

01:38:57.980 --> 01:39:04.980
my grandfather used to supply an awful lot of businesses with meat.

01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:12.980
But on a Saturday night, there were a lot of people down the pill area and the poorer areas of Newport who didn't have money

01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:16.980
and the kids would be without shoes and so forth.

01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:22.980
And my grandfather would hold an auction on a Saturday night because they had no cold stores you see.

01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:25.980
So all the meat that was killed had to be got rid of.

01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:32.980
So he'd auction off this meat and he used to make sure he'd auction it off to people for nothing.

01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:34.980
So they had meat for Sundays.

01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:35.980
Wow.

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:43.980
If anybody came up with, looked a bit poor, he would make sure they had.

01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:51.980
And one day I was with the NFU doing a stand-up job in Newport Square

01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:59.980
trying to present to people what farmers could produce.

01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:04.980
So we wanted them to know that we were still around producing their food.

01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:08.980
And a little old lady came along and we got talking.

01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:15.980
And she said, oh, I've always bought my stuff in the market and I liked fresh food.

01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:21.980
And she said, and there was an old gentleman, Mr. Collymore, when we were children, we couldn't afford meat.

01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:28.980
And my mother used to come and take us children down there and we'd always have something for Sunday.

01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:30.980
And I thought, oh, well, that story was true.

01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:32.980
Oh, that's lovely, isn't it?

01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:33.980
It was nice to hear.

01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:36.980
Yeah, yeah, to have it confirmed by a third party as well.

01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:42.980
Yes, because a lot of people used to talk about it and I never knew for sure until this lady.

01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:48.980
I thought, what a coincidence that I should talk to her.

01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:54.980
Do you know places like Redwick and Furtherfield, Mega and Rocket?

01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:59.980
Do you consider them, they consider themselves to be the Moors?

01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:00.980
They talk about the Moors.

01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:01.980
Yeah.

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:03.980
Do you from here consider them to be the Moors?

01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:04.980
Oh, yes, yes.

01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:12.980
And so is there any relation to them or are all the villages here quite separate?

01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:19.980
I think we've become more related of latter years since the children have been going to Mega school from this area.

01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:20.980
Oh, OK.

01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:23.980
And you get to know all the mums and whatever.

01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:33.980
We've always connected from the farming point of view because a lot of my relatives and a lot of David's relatives live in those areas, in all those villages.

01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:41.980
When I was at school and my friends lived over that area, I was often staying up there.

01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:44.980
And I remember the hunt coming into the square at Mega.

01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:49.980
And it was just a tiny little village, Mega was, when we were children.

01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:54.980
That you'd walk down to from whoever's home you were staying at.

01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:55.980
Yeah.

01:41:55.980 --> 01:42:00.980
And I suppose we've seen that grow into almost a town size.

01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:01.980
And that's strange.

01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:03.980
It's changed everything.

01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:05.980
And the road system round.

01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:14.980
When they came and put Tesco's there, that change started to change Mega and the brewery and all of that.

01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:16.980
So, yes, we still feel relatively.

01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:22.980
And of latter years we've become a ministry area, a benefits area.

01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:33.980
But through the churches, for the last 30, perhaps 35 years, I've been connected with all the churches out there through my work.

01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:34.980
Yeah.

01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:36.980
And you get to know more people.

01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:40.980
So, I have felt connected for a very long time.

01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:42.980
And I'm sure there are other people like me.

01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:52.980
Maybe not many, but some of us have been involved with church life in that particular area.

01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:55.980
Would you say it's still strong here, too, church life?

01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:57.980
No, nothing like it was.

01:42:57.980 --> 01:42:58.980
No.

01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:00.980
No, it's quite sad.

01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:04.980
Our congregation has dwindled with age.

01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:10.980
And, yes, it is a huge change.

01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:15.980
So, perhaps we could talk about that again sometime.

01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:16.980
Yeah.

01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:19.980
I'm just very excited about the time because...

01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:21.980
Do you have other appointments now?

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:22.980
No, for you.

01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:24.980
I mean, what time is it, Sue?

01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:25.980
Oh, it's 25 to 2.

01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:26.980
Yes.

01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:27.980
So, I've got one at 2.30.

01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:28.980
Yes.

01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:30.980
So, is there anything else you'd like to add?

01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:34.980
I have so much I'd like to add, but perhaps we could do more another time.

01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:35.980
Yeah.

01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:37.980
Should I turn this off now?

01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:38.980
Mm-hmm.
