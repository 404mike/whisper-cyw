00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Extract from the life of St. Ultid.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.240
A solitary wayfarer, whom God accompanied,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.640
having abandoned all secular things,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.760
kept on his way until he arrived at the valley

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.000
called Hodnant,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.960
which not without reason means in Latin

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.580
prosperous.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.060
About it stood no mountains or steep unevenness,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.940
but a most fertile open plain.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.620
There was a thick wood,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.300
planted with diverse trees,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.220
the crowded abode of wild beasts.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.020
A pleasing river laved its two banks,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.640
and wells intermixed with rills along their pleasing courses.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.260
After he had rested and examined everything,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
the delectable spot pleased him,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.340
as the angel had indicated before in dreams.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.620
Here is the woody grove,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.300
a sunny spot to those who tarry there.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.600
Here too about the plains is rich fertility.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.580
Through the midst there runs a flowing stream of waters.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.980
This, I know, may be said,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.980
it is the most beautiful of places.
