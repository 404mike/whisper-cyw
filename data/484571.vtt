Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Interviewee Liz Price.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Location of the interview, Swicker Office.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And today's date is the 29th of September 2015.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Liz, for the record, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That's fine, yes. My name's Liz Price, which is L-I-Z-P-R-I-C-E.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Liz, how did you first get involved with the Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I got involved with Swicker because I volunteered for them.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So I was studying graphic design in Cardiff and I'd just come to the end of my course,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
graduated and had a minor, oh my God, what am I going to do moment.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And I contacted a load of different organisations and said, can I come and volunteer on some projects?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Because I'd always enjoyed doing things with school kids and, you know, like projects and things like that.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So I got in touch with the Swicker office and I think the first project I did was the Cofilly Lantern Parade.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So I volunteered over three weeks, three weekends doing that, enjoyed it, had a great time.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And then when it came around to the carnival project the following year,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
you guys got in touch with me and asked if I'd like to work as a trainee.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I believe we felt that the force is strong in this one.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And it was great. So it was working with Ben and Jude, who I'd worked with on the Lantern Parade.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So it wasn't quite as frightening arriving there on day one.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But yeah, then working with all of the guys from St Vincent.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I think it was St Vincent guys and Amara was leading it.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Ben and Jude were working as artists and Zoe Hewitt was fellow trainee with me.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And it was the year of Spirit of Mother Earth when we did a lot of spray dyeing.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I think it rained almost continuously through the summer.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So it was like working in a Chinese laundry.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We were spray dyeing costumes.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I mean, it was great because it introduced me to loads of different techniques.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So we were doing a bit of batik and a bit of spray dye and stamping and things like that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And then these people were hung up on ropes in the carnival camp, which looked like a Chinese laundry.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There's a lovely image.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It was lovely. I think Ben and Jude were doing it part time.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So yeah, it was a lot to take in, as I remember it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And a really intensive project, but people made me feel really welcome.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It was great fun.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And the first year was really just getting my head around it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Can you remember going on parade for the very first time?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I remember it lining up behind the Butte Town Youth Pavilion and it just being enormous.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And just that whole day of organizing people, the amount of time it took to get everything out there, get people in costume.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
What's it like being under the intense, but everybody wants your attention, don't they?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Everybody needs that additional staple, that additional complete.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So you're like this magnet with sort of people accreting themselves to you.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I can see you and the other tutors sort of walking around and people, yeah, they spot you.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And then it's just a whoomp. You can tell where any member of the team is because they've got a little world to them.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So how do you manage to, because I always say you with a very calm demeanor and a fabulous smile.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
What's happening below the water line?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm paddling like crazy.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Really?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Yeah, no, it's.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I thought you were superhuman.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Well, you just deal with whatever's in front of you as quickly as you can, because it's like I always think of it like being on a very busy bar on match day.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I used to work in emails.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So on match day, the minute you'd served someone, there would be someone else in their place and it would just go on for hours and hours and hours.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Of course, I've now got machines that can pour 10 or 20 pints in one go.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Have they?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
They have, allegedly. I wouldn't know.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
That would have been good.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Yeah, and that and that.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But yeah, so.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Robot tutor.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
That's what you need.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I serve your cultural needs.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
No, it's great.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And you know, you just remember that that people people get in a bit of a tis and they get they're very excited and the energy is rising and the noise levels are rising and they're not trying to do your head in and they're not trying to stress you out.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.000
They just, you know, they've got something that has broken or a bit of elastic that's come astray or they're not entirely sure what they're doing.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So all you can do is just try and direct them.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And on the on the big day itself, would you be of course garbed in the what would you call them?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The workmen sort of.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Tool belt.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Tool belt.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Something about Batman and his utility belt and you guys or RoboCop.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
It's like, you know, there's almost like nothing you're not carrying.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You know, it's like your wrists have got gaffer tape on, you've got the tool belt on with additional bits hanging off in the rest of it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Absolutely.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And there's no question that you've been asked to which the answer is I don't know or I can't help.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Yes, I can.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Yeah, you've got to figure it out.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Supreme positivity.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
It's just like no barrier.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
It's just like boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You can't get through it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
You're going to go round it.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
You're going to go over it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Yeah, you just figure it out because on that day it's not like, right, I'm going to go away and think about it.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
It's just, well, it's going to have to work.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The clock is ticking.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So the first year, it was pretty, I remember it being pretty overwhelming and just trying to take it all in.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And I tend to be someone who learns by by doing.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So I've got to go through something to then be able to reflect on it and figure out, OK, how can I approach this differently next time?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
How many paracetamol?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Absolutely.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So the second year then, once you understand the process, you can take a bit more ownership of it.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I think the following year was all to do with the abolition of slavery.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Right, yes, absolutely.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And it was great.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I really enjoyed having the themes to work from, actually.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000
As a designer, I really enjoy having having a limited set of rules that I have to work to.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It forces me to be more creative.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Yes, something terrifying about a blank piece of paper, isn't it?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Oh, God, yeah, absolutely.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
What? An infinite variety of possibilities? What?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Well, you just do nothing at all.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It's very difficult.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Community participants used to, left without, used to come up with the Simpsons or Power Rangers.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
We very early had a rule saying there's nothing Simpson-esque or Power Ranger-y going to happen in this grade.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
No, definitely not. No Simpsons.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
We did have a Lego, what was it, something from the Lego movie.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
There's public culture snuck in once we've had our...

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
She did it well, though, fair play to her.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I haven't even seen the movie, but it did look good.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
But yeah, no, I really enjoyed that one.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Because it was quite a meaty theme to get your teeth into.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So, Heloise Godfrey and I made some quite large puppets with enormous heads that were big backpack costumes

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that were like the people profiting from the slave trade, the people importing the sugar and all the rest of it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Yeah, but it was great.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I really enjoyed making something large and having to figure out all of those problems.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And then you've got to find someone to go in the cost.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Yeah, absolutely. Would you care to portray a baddie?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
It's never a good opening line, is it?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Yeah, would you like to be a...

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I remember Sambergalaius had to be colonialist 18th century troops

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and effectively subdue Caribbean slaves who escaped and the rest of it.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
They weren't best pleased.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000
They weren't best pleased. It was like, we'll do it this time, but we don't actually want to play the forces of oppression.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
They don't want to be meanies.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Yes, we don't want to play the forces of oppression in the future.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So yeah, that's what's the dilemma if you're trying to actually tell the story.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Yeah, absolutely. And we used to make for all the bands as well.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So all of the bands had headdresses and costumes.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And although, I mean, that was full on making for all of the bands as well, because they're not in making with you.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You're just trying to find members of the public to help you with it.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:44.000
But the good thing about that was that you get this mass of 30 of the same things, which I always thought was just great.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
They also look beautiful. They're pleasing to the something about, as you say, multiplicity, which is just like good for the brain.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Yeah, pattern. Yeah, exactly.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Look at Ikea. Repetition.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Look at Ikea.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Yeah, many things on a shelf. Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And so I did enjoy that, although, you know, that is easy to say that with hindsight when you're in the midst of making.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Oh, God, what did Anna Rutter designed a headdress one year?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:22.000
It was that year, I think, and it was ships and they all had these tiny little fiber pole masts on them.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And there were about 30 of them. And halfway through, you're just thinking, why are we doing this?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
There has to be a simpler way of doing this.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And she she, you know, she was very interested in making things that pleased her and that were a particular form.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And I think she made some fish where you had almost all of the rib, the rib parts of the fish and the fabric joined it all together.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And they looked amazing. But my God, it was absolute.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And it's all very well, they're going, oh, I've designed this marvelous thing.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Now I like to. Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But the interesting thing about when I first started was that we used to run and we used to run the carnival in Swansea as well.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So everything we made in Cardiff, you could then add to when you got to Swansea.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And although we'd be making new there as well, it gave you a base to build on.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Yes. And I loved Swansea.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I mean, it was a very different beast, really, being because we were living there as well.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So everyone was staying in a shared house, which made it just that much more intense.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
No escape to Hammersmith.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And when the parade set off, and I do remember this, the first.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So the first year I did a traineeship, I was in Cardiff, but I didn't go to Swansea.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I think they were. Heloise was one of the trainees in Swansea then.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
But the second year I did, we both did both.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And Anna Rutter was working that year. This was the Spirit of Resistance one.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And she, as the carnival went off, and you know, you've been running around like a headless chicken,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
trying to get everyone into their costumes, everyone into their sections, all the sections in the right order.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And it went off down that road because we were right at the top of the hill, weren't we?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And she stopped me and she said, right, look at that. You did that.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And it was just the most amazing moment to see it all spread out ahead of you.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Certainly seeing it up and down the hills in Townhill and knowing that, in fact, Swansea Carnival,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
about the time you're talking about, was at its peak.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And simply in terms of numbers, there were over a thousand costumes there.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And certainly I have never seen a swifter, has never produced a bigger parade before or since.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And it's beautiful sunshine. But something about seeing it being at the bottom of a hill and seeing it going up a slope.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And, you know, we talk about rivers of light or rivers of colour.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I mean, you know, that was just like astounding. It was, wasn't it? Absolutely.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
It was a high point in many ways.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And you've come to the end of essentially a whole summer of making because you've done three weeks carding for Week Off, three weeks Swansea.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So you're completely spent. No, no, absolutely.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And the concept of a summer holiday just didn't exist for ten years.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Absolutely. Yeah. But it was I mean, that was that was a moment that I'll never forget, actually.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And I'm so pleased that she, you know, had the foresight to stop me and say, right, just take this moment.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Oh, bless. You know, she's very sweet.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And I learned a lot from from her and from Ben and Jude and from all of the artists I worked with, really.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And they were all very welcoming and inclusive.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Your hands don't seem unduly scarred by glue gunning.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I have learned. You have learned.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I did get a glue gun injury, one that went under my nail. They're the worst.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And it had been on, I think the gun had been on for quite a long time.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I think that was in Blind Avenue. Oh, right.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Blind Avenue Carnival.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
There is a tendency, you know, to associate the creative carnival with the smell of burning flesh.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
With the advent of the glue gun.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
It's true. It's true. Yes.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Yeah, no, that was quite a while ago.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And I learned not to not to do that again.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Yeah. And then, of course, you took a break from Carnival and rejoined us in 2014.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I did. So I I took a break because I went and did a teaching qualification.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
So I was working, teaching, studying, studying, teaching and teaching at the same time, which was interesting.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And then I got a job working for a charity, Vision 21, who have some of the members of Vision 21 have been involved in the project as well.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So while I was there, I built up a bit of a collaboration with Swicker and Vision.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.000
The difficult thing with Vision 21 is that the students desperately want to come, but it's not up to them whether or not they can, because they need someone to bring them.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Absolutely. So they loved being involved.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And Becky would come over and make things with them.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000
But anything where you asked for participation on a weekend, it was very, very difficult to guarantee.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000
It's very sad that there's that barrier that for many, yes, almost insuperable at times.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Really frustrating, because if you try to do anything extracurricular, they used to do almost like a sports event on a weekend and we'd managed to get maybe six or seven students out of, God, you know, there must have been close to 100 attending.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
That's a very poor turnout. Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So it was a rush. And they were all winners. They all got medals. Yeah, it was all good.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000
But yeah, so I sadly then I had a proper job, which meant I couldn't take three weeks off to play with sequins and feathers and get involved with that.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So I had a bit of a break and then I went freelance again.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Yes. Tell us a bit about your freelance artistic practice.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
OK, so I'm a graphic designer and an illustrator.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I kind of straddle the two. So I'm not quite one and not quite the other and a bit of both really.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So, yeah, visual communication, really.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So I do some bits of graphic design work like logos, brochures and stuff for web.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
But then I also do some illustration work for people when they need it.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000
But also I teach. So I'm a lecturer up in Hereford College of Arts and I do bits and pieces in Cardiff as well.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So I'm a bit of a jigsaw of different bits and pieces, really.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:01.000
But having done the proper job for a few years, I just got to the point where I was like, oh, you know what, this isn't me.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
All I was doing was managing other people and not really getting to even teach.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I was very much in a in a in a middle management role.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And although that was challenging in its own way, I wasn't getting the contact with people or the chance to to really be creative myself.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So I just got to the point where I thought, you know what, I've just got to take the plunge and see what happens.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
If it doesn't turn into anything, then I can get another job.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
But it did. So it's all good and I'm happy.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Excellent. Excellent.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.000
So, yeah, I came back and it was the first year we were in Fitz Allen High, which was such a such a good venue.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Yes. Really good space.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
The I didn't do it at the sports place.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Where was that?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
At Townsview Leisure Centre.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
So I know natural daylight.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Lots of space, no natural daylight.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And really, we didn't have access to sunlight outside either.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
So, yes, it was it met the brief.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
It had to be in South Cardiff.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
But other than that, it was a and then the noise down there as well.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I mean, you're in a big booming sports hall.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Very echoey.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Yes, it was.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Yeah. Well, I popped down and visited.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
But yeah, I was pleased not to have.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And Fitz Allen was a great space being able to have an area for the larger costumes and an area for public and for the smaller stuff that we were doing with the groups and things.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And for the boys to go outside and do everything from sit around and chat or kick a football around, you know, far more community orientated.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Definitely.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Yes, definitely.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Yeah.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
So 2015.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Yeah.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
You were with us again.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Would you tell us a bit about the section and your designs in particular?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
What what moments stand out for you?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
What challenges you faced this summer just gone?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
What?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
OK.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
How was it for you, Liz?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Well, because since I've returned to the carnival, there isn't really a theme linked to to the parade.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
I tend to impose my own theme because I can't I can't just pick things out of thin air.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
So 2015 was the year of light, according to a scientific association somewhere I discovered.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
So all of my costumes were based on on that as a starting point.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So I'm just thinking I had a section of fireflies who had lighter bums.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I wondered if that was going to come up.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
No, yeah, that was like a bums.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Is there anybody out there?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Which was really fun.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I mean, that was that was something to get my teeth into.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
I really enjoyed that.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
What else did I have?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
I had a large costume, which was a Zeus based on the fact that he has lightning.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I had a Las Vegas section.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Was that it?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Did I have anything else?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
I think I was going to have a little section of lampshades, but it didn't happen.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Nobody was terribly excited.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I like the whole of the audio visions, but Las Vegas in particular quite fun because if you could get them to that, they actually had letters, didn't they?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Yes.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
To explain who they were.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Yeah.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And if the unlikely event you could persuade them to stand still in the right order, it totally decoded it.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
And then within two seconds, it was like, hang on.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
There we are.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
You know, it was like, yeah, it was dyslexic nightmare.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Well, and the last one was the last one.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
It was dyslexic nightmare.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Well, and the Las Vegas, the Las Vegas thing, it wasn't about Las Vegas.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
It was about the neon signs, which is how it linked back to the Nation of Light.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
But also for me, a massive love for me is typography.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I was about to say there was something about that.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
I could tell instantly where this had come from.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
So it was a nice productions.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
It was a bit like that.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
No, but it was entirely good like that.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
It was very clear as well.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Well, and I do have a bit of a love for that old circus type.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
It's called bifurcated.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Is that what it is?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Because I like that as well.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And recently I'm a veteran charity shopper and I got a national geographic from, I think,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:34.000
it's about 1913 and I got it because it's got its principal articles about circus.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
And they had an older version of exactly what you're talking about.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000
And I was trying, you know, the minute you get to a charity shop, you can run in there forever.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
But as soon as I saw that typeface, it made me think of what you've done.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
And I just thought, oh, and it was circus.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Yes.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Sold.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Yes, very much so.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I must get a frame for the cover, which I just thought it was.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
It's just very beautiful artwork.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
I bet.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Yeah, it made me think of lots of positive times.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Well, sign writing is having a bit of a resurgence as well.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000
The people who do the lettering on ferris wheels and all that kind of stuff.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
It's seen as quite a hipster thing.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Is it?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Because there's an old time, I only know one sort of sign writer in Cardiff.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
It's the guy in Clare Road.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I don't know him.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
He does all the work for Mario Morris, our carnival emcee.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And it's very distinctive, his writing and the way he approaches it.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
So I always know it's, oh, that's the Rangetown man, that's the Rangetown man, that's the Rangetown man.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
You can spot it a mile off.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Yeah, it's his.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
That's what he does and that's how he does it.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Doesn't matter what message you want to put on it.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Yeah, they could be, you know, two antipathetic ones next to each other.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
They're still his work.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
So it's like, you know, and there's something about the fact that, you know, that they were made by machine.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
They're also, you know, that's, yeah, no electricity was used in the production of this.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Absolutely. Yeah, you haven't just typed it into words.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Which could explain the odd spelling mistake in his work, truth be told.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
But there we go.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000
There are many heroes in Cardiff Carnival, but I hereby declare Liz Price, you are a Cardiff Carnival hero.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Thank you very much indeed.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Thank you.
