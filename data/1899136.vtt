00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And in a way you can relate that to an anti-establishment view.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I mean, she lived under the National Socialist System in Germany.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, I mean that could be regarded as how an establishment can rule immorally, etc. etc.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So, she was quite willing here, if she saw injustice by the establishment.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Well, dear me, I'm not going to give in to that kind of immoral establishment.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So, you can link it then to two experiences.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I mean, positivity for gaining basic rights for the Welsh language would be compatible to her opposition to the regime in Germany.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You sometimes see refugees becoming more English than English in order to fit in.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Well, I don't know whether she became more Welsh than Welsh, you know.
