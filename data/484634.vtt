00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.480
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.920
Interviewee Stephanie Gowna.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.840
The location is the Swicker office and today's date is the 1st of October 2015.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.480
Stephanie, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.480
Thank you.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.480
Okay.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.480
G-A-W-N-E.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.480
Thank you very much indeed.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.480
Steph, how did you first get involved with Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:50.000
I first got involved with Cardiff Carnival probably a decade ago and it was being approached

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.440
for my belly dance group to join in the carnival which was then going down from Grangetown

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.440
up through to town.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.440
Got it.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.840
And the name of the group at that point, can you remember?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.440
I don't know if we were the Persian Bells then, I've got a feeling we were just Stephanie's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.440
belly dance group.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.440
It did what it said on the tin.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.440
Yeah, I remember.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.000
I've always thought of you as the godmother of the burlesque scene in Wales and particularly

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.800
in Cardiff.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:30.400
With your burly girl hat on, of course we got together to plan a fun carnival back in

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.160
2013 I think.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:42.200
Yeah I think it was, if not 2012, it was one of those, I can't remember.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.480
This is when you had the stages in town and I think we've had three years of stage, being

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.480
on the stages.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.440
Immediately you said that, I thought one of the highlights of our working relationship

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:05.240
and it was the first time we got to work together with you on the carnival was to actually watch,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:15.040
I think there were 23 of you, 23 wonderful dancers doing the can-can in the sunshine,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.240
in the centre of Cardiff, in Queen Street and of course the traditional can-can, we

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:29.520
had the music, but it's that fantastic, what can I say, Apache war-whooping split at the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.520
end.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.920
I was thinking, well if Two Losers Trek was here now, the absence would be on him, putting

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.920
you on the spot, would you care to give us a can-can, what's that noise like as you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.280
girls finally go hit the day?

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.160
Thank you very much, that was exactly it, in one.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.880
Of course carnival, even the carnival, has had many different formats and many different

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.160
routes, the carnival camp has changed etc.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.240
Back in 2012, no it was when we first started working again together, the idea was to broaden

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.880
carnival and bring in other groups and the rest of it and I can remember going the December

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:25.880
before, so it would be December 2011, to the Masonic Lodge and I haven't been to, I think

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.880
then you were the?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.880
Burlesque Cardiff.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.200
Burlesque Cardiff, so I went to see Burlesque Cardiff to see what it was all about, I'd

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.880
heard lots of good things, great night out, very very creative, very very humorous and

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.040
I went along and I just fell in love with you and your community group and I also saw

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.320
one thing there which I hadn't seen before and of course it was part of your crossover

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.840
between belly dancing and cabaret, was I saw my first ever pair of ISIS wings, would you

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.200
like to explain what an ISIS wing, where it comes from and what it looks like, because

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.600
even as we sit in the swicker office there's a whole bevy of them behind us in amazing

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.960
colours, so I hadn't seen one before and I just thought oh.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:21.560
Yeah, yeah, well the ISIS wings, it's a belly dance prop, it doesn't actually have any historic

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:30.600
basis in belly dance, it's a completely modern prop that dancers use, it's a pleated, permanent

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:40.400
pleated cape which goes around the neck and it will open out to 360 degrees, so it will

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.640
make a complete circle, at least a decent one will make a complete circle or near enough,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.360
so when you open the sides of the cape have got sticks in them, so when you lift the sticks

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.680
up you can make this big circle and you can make lovely shapes with your cape as you're

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.680
dancing.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.560
Yeah, it was interesting because immediately I saw a point of contact with carnival and

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.320
one of my gurus, even to this day of creative carnival, is a man who revolutionised carnival

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.800
in Trinidad, a man called Peter Minchel who went on to do fabulous things, he reintroduced

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.120
the artist back into the Trinidad carnival, his group were part of not one but two Olympic

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.520
Games ceremony openings and his breakthrough movement was creating a costume called the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.960
Hummingbird where you had those wings and you had the extension of them through the

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.160
hand and through the sticks and immediately I thought, oh my gosh that looks carnival-esque

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.040
for me and the fact that the Isis wings that you were performing with and which we have

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:58.480
adopted in a lot of our work were made in bright, shiny, scintillating colours which

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.480
really caught the light and were magical, so that was immediately one thing I was thinking

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.560
oh my goodness we've got to get some of those in the wonderful world of carnival, I think

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:18.320
originally we ended up importing some via a belly dance organiser in South Wales but

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.080
importing them from Egypt. Yeah that was through Sue, that was through Sue who calls herself

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:32.840
Sophina in Newport and she's married to an Egyptian. This is just how times have changed

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.280
because actually now you were just, I mean this was only a few years ago, whereas now

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.080
Isis wings you would just easily, easily buy them off the internet directly. Yes and in fact

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.320
that's ultimately what we do now. Yes well I think I certainly think that you and your group

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.160
were part of popularising them here in Wales because you know they were used them to such

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.320
good effect and it's that whole thing of carnival about how do you transform someone and make them

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.000
larger than life and a pair of Isis wings you know and the way they respond to movement it just

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.320
touched a chord in me immediately and I thought like oh these are these you know we've got a lot

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.800
in common with these people. Yeah we started, I taught a workshop for the carnival crew didn't I

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.480
for your dances and chapter when you first got your Isis wings just kind of showing them you know

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.320
what you could do what the what the limitations were and how to use them which is fun but the

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.560
actual routine that you saw me do in the burlesque show must have been my war of the worlds

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.320
which sounds like the whole you know which is a real steampunk number which is

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:44.320
miles away from from from you know carnival. I'm glad I made a leap. Yeah yeah you did make a real

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:51.440
leap because it was quite a tenuous one yeah yeah yeah great though. No I mean the other thing that

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:58.320
was quite obvious as I sat there in the Masonic Lodge in Cardiff equally was that here was a very

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.000
upbeat exciting group of people you know with you at the helm and perhaps we should come back to

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.160
your pivotal role a bit later but the the costumes and the props there was there was a

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:18.240
a crossover in terms of what can I say transforming dressing up with style and sass and pizzazz

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:25.680
and I was thinking oh you know here we are coming from we've recently sort of left behind us

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.520
our principal international influence of being Caribbean carnival and we were very interested

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.360
at that time in taking on more of a Latin American feel to our work so particularly with

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.200
Adrian Spinola becoming our artistic coordinator of the carnival camp here in Cardiff and elsewhere

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:51.680
and his interest in headdresses again with the internet making feathers and sequins and braid

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.840
much more cheaply I mean you know feathers used to be an incredible luxury for us and now

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.440
we can import them from China at a massively reduced cost I always think there must be a

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.920
lot of very bald pheasants in China. I don't like to think about the animal husband

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:18.320
feathers. Absolutely so having done that I know you and I chatted and in the the format

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:25.120
that we had for 2012 onwards where we we returned to the city centre we had these street stages

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.800
I mean your groups you had two groups of course you had your balesque group

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:41.680
also your Persian bells belly dance group and if I mentioned the time warp from

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.840
the Rocky Horror Picture Show this is another standout moment for me so on the one hand

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:53.120
we've got the first and probably only time that the cam can has been performed with such energy

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.600
yeah right in the centre of Cardiff I mean yes there was an audience but as you know people

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.720
gathered I mean there were people coming out of the Queen's Arcade shopping centre and just

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:12.320
completely yeah their jaws dropped and you know that can-can moment but another standout moment

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:19.280
for me was let's do the time warp again what's that what's that bring back in terms of yes

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:25.200
yeah that was that was a great idea so the time warp is we dance the time warp with the with my

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.200
burlesque treat with the cabaret girls and it comes out quite a lot Halloween events it comes out at

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:39.600
our sci-fi shows and putting together we always with the carnival we always have a little bit

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:46.080
of an issue trying to put together routines that don't involve any striptease which is and

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:53.280
obviously the time warp we do it as as in the Rocky Horror Picture Show film and we keep our

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.480
clothes on and it's and it was it was it was great we did doing that in the carnival I think

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:09.120
was just the year before last of 14 I think yeah yeah it was a real real crowd pleaser and and

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.760
people remember it you know to do routines where people know the music and they you know the

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:19.680
Rocky Horror Picture Show what are we in the was it 40 years ago it came out Richard O'Brien's got

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:27.280
a lot to answer for in a good way it's a part of a lot of people's you know childhood or

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:35.600
early years so people enjoy watching it and and it's it's it's it's quirky you know the costumes

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.280
are fun and it's accessible for people so no it went down really well absolutely I mentioned that

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.880
the the the headdresses and particularly those with a sort of Latin American samba feel with feathers

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:54.160
has it has been something that's a crossover that both our art forms have enjoyed and certainly

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:01.680
Swickr Carnival organized specifically for your group headdress making workshops I remember on a

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.400
Saturday morning popping in to return some bank keys I'd forgotten of course that there was another

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.960
sort of carnival workshop going on and this was the caged bra workshop I hadn't quite understood

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:19.680
what caged bra was until I opened the door would you care to elucidate yeah well we

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:26.480
we were going to do some work we did some other work with you which was going to be more carnival

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:38.640
more Rio style so I we had to do a swift learning curve I learned how to do a non-pay samba and

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:45.760
you know a basic samba and worked out a basic samba routine for for my performers who then needed

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.160
to be dressed and I think we did that in yeah we did that in one of the Burlesque art of shows and

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.920
when we did the same routine in the carnival so then the girls are looking at costumes and there's

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.640
all these amazing costumes on the internet yes they're seeing all the girls all the professional

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:07.520
dancers from Rio and the big carnivals and a lot of whom are wearing caged bras so it's like an

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:14.720
underwire so it's the underwire of your bra and so the underwire is kind of keeping the boobs

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:21.520
up and then you've got which is always good and then you have pattern within that the the cup

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.040
shape so it might be a flower or a star or or whatever pattern you've got all this is made with

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:35.360
wire which is then covered with tape and then embellished and decorated so it's an it's an

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.720
underwire I mean it could be as as naked or as covered as you wanted it to be but it's very much

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:50.400
a sort of a staple of the um of the traditional you know Brazilian sort of samba um carnival

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.320
and and what's great is is through doing that doing the workshops with the girls so I just and

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.120
I was actually teaching a samba work you know a weekly class for a while here in chapter

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:10.480
um I had um Mitzi come over from Bristol teach me and then I taught my my girls and and um and

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.000
found what I could on YouTube and stuff and taught you know for for for six months uh kind

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.760
of explored the whole sort of samba samba side of things what was nice was Mitzi then picked

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:29.760
off one of my dancers Gillian and Gillian you know works as a samba dancer for Mitzi where Mitzi needs

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.200
professional performers for her you know her the gigs she gets in restaurants or or whatever it

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:44.240
being so through us having the link together you know we brought that awareness of of the authentic

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:50.080
cabaret costumes to the I don't know 50 or whatever girls I was teaching at that time

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.120
some of which wanted to explore it further and came and did samba classes and actually learn a

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.320
proper to do the proper samba step and some of which went off and actually performed you know are

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.200
you know for want of a better word professional samba dancers with full costumes and and a little

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:11.200
costumes as well but they made themselves you know some of these samba costumes you see them on the

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.880
internet and they are amazing but we're looking at there's you know 400 500 quid with amazing

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:23.920
headdresses you know the g strings the the thong bottoms the underwire the cuffs and the headdress

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:30.000
you know and the the things on the shins as well but you know Gillian made all her own costume you

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.960
know a bit of help from swicker well a lot of help from swicker a lot of help madrian and a glue gun

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.560
and they're off as she's away and that's 500 saved and it's amazing what you do a little bit

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.520
gardening wire isn't it amazing when you do gardening wire and you know yeah it takes the

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:52.800
whole it takes people's experience of dance and where it's going to go where it will lead so we've

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.880
done every single every so many different styles for swicker everything from the time walk to the

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:06.960
can can to you know samba dances um yeah it's been great um obviously uh when you've been performing

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.880
with card of carnival which is very much a a family orientated as you say uh no striptease no

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:19.040
titillation i think it's safe to say that uh uh you know uh we were we were both in family friendly

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:27.520
mode oh definitely um burlesque in cardiff in wales um i always refer to you as the godmother

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:35.200
of the the welsh burlesque scene uh i i yes how did you get into it and and perhaps

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:42.480
yeah is it even now understood i mean uh what what kind of barriers have you met historically and

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:53.040
and do they exist now or whatever so um i got into burlesque as i was teaching a lot of belly

00:16:53.040 --> 00:17:02.240
dance i i was uh living in turkey married to a turk and and got into belly dance that way

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.680
kate got divorced came back here did a lot of teaching and i was very popular at the time there

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.880
was no i think there was one other maybe sophina there was one other belly dance teacher in cardiff

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.960
so i was doing well i was picking up all the work all the professional dancing work very busy

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:21.040
classes um that started to pitter off a little bit the edge started to come off it as other

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:29.120
people started to come in and teach belly dance um and you know the the whole you know with the

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.400
internet things get uh people are seeing more and the whole thing has become slightly more diluted

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:44.720
at the same time um i met my partner robert um so that must have been about eight years ago from

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:52.960
now well my background before moving to turkey was um very much commercial theater so cabaret

00:17:52.960 --> 00:18:01.680
floor shows pantomime summer seasons um musical my training was in musical theater um and i you know

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:07.600
when i was 19 i was working in floor shows in japan and china hong kong um i mean i was a i was

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:14.320
a topless dancer in in japan when i was 20 um i and then came back and do you know come back and

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:20.560
take a part in pantomime you know it was behind you behind you yeah exactly so it was is really

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.800
just coming from that jobbing background well it made perfect sense when there was this burlesque

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.840
revival for me to think well this is my background you know i've got the belly dance i've got the

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:36.560
bumps and grinds i've got the physicality um and then there's all this other stuff there's the

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:43.520
all this you know the the showgirl stuff the jazz dance the funky stuff that i've done

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:50.880
in my work as a commercial dancer um you know from the age of sort of 19 to sort of i suppose

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:59.520
27 when i moved to 28 so i have all that all those different um genres behind me so actually to

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.760
then go i didn't think about necessarily burlesque we were cabaret when i started the classes and i

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.240
think the first class i did was with my belly dance group and that was mine hair again which

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.680
has been a great staple that's come out we've done it at the carnival we've done all over the place

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:22.800
um and then from mine hair i i did a few choice i did a few solos um i did the mariontonette solo

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:30.080
i did little red riding herd i did just a few solos um as a burlesque performer but there was

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:37.440
burlesque there was the um in carnival before i started because i remember going to see um lady

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:47.760
lollipop and um johnny cage's ex-wife um at minskies when it was what the butler saw i don't know if

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.920
you ever went to any of those so there was there were i went to minskies i didn't catch that there

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.360
was a little bit of an underground burlesque movement but i think what i did was i kind of

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:03.520
um branded myself as burlesque cardiff which was a little bit like it was a big which is a good

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.560
thing to do and because my background has always been teaching i had this big band of ladies around

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:14.480
me coming to classes those people then became in the went into the shows and then through those

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.600
lessons we've had some amazing international performers have come through so we've had

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.400
the likes of sandy shaw who you know is all over the place we've got betty blue eyes who's a

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:32.800
fantastic international performer barry island who's my drag king we've got had katie von cupcakes

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:40.080
yee-hee sexton we've had a lot of again gillian who is is uh epic so she's you know bonita boudoir

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.600
she's going to be in the culture wars at my festival in november so it's it's created this

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.960
real um this real little sort of workhouse of performers and shows and you know the amount of

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.280
material that you know we've done over the last eight years with sort of i don't know how many

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:03.440
shows a year probably about five five or six different shows a year um always putting out

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.720
always pumping out new material yes i mean to some people but particularly those who well

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.720
exclusively those who actually haven't been to see what you do they in their minds i have some

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.560
kind of sleazy connotations whereas it seems to me quite plain and particularly you know when you

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.480
meet the group and then get a sense of who these women are what they're getting out of it and the

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:32.560
way they treat each other um don't put words in your mouth but yes where would you say it's

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.400
coming from you know faced with that criticism all that all that unfounded prejudice i mean i

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.040
think it is i think it's quite threatening for people when they're not involved in it and i

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.400
think when i i know talking talking to people who i think you know at the school gates who i think

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.200
are going to be you know um we have we have a friendship and i think that they're just about

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.920
this is the right time to tell them you have to judge the moment um but i am actually koo koo

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:04.240
labelle and i'm a international burlesque performer it it's it's people don't really want to

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:11.440
know they want to think oh that's stephanie that's meg's mum they don't want to think about you as a

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:18.160
striptease artist when they see what i do when they see me come in say as the butterfly in my

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.120
cocoon crawling along the floor i mean there's a lot of humor in your work and in the group's work

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:30.880
my work there's there's an awful lot of humor yes um and and i think burlesque it's it's not

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:37.920
striptease and it's not necessarily very even very sexy and i think this is what people have told me

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.760
when they've seen the shows in the nicest possible way no absolutely that's great fun but it's it's

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:50.800
not sexy because the girls are so in control so it's not like you're watching anything that's

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:56.000
particularly pornographic or anything like that unless you you know you might have a performer who

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.040
who has that sexuality but they're always dressed to a degree yeah and let's say there's no full

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.320
nudity there's no nudity you know we're we're by law not allowed to show any genitalia which

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:13.760
includes clues areola so there's no nipples on display there's no nothing on display the

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:19.760
costumes can get very very risque but it's all to do with the with the um the environment that

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.960
you're putting on the shows and how the shows and how the acts are set up um saying that you know we

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:31.200
have some brilliant soloists and we invite people to perform with us who are internationally known

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:37.680
and very very very high standard standard very high caliber of performers but the group that performs

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:44.240
um it's rare that everybody who comes to my class wants to do a full striptease and actually bear

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:49.280
all and the women i think get an awful lot of you know for me as a person it's made me a lot

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:55.040
more empowered and a lot more aware of my sexuality and women's sexuality as a whole um

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.200
and i think that's what they get out of it i think that's what the women get out of it who come to

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:05.440
the classes and and other professional performers i know are very um i don't want to buzz things

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:12.080
about um you know are amazingly sort of strong strong women no i i i as i say i mean one of the

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:16.480
things i like about the group is the group identity yeah the way they look after each other

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:24.160
as you say strong independent and but also a cohesive group um and and the last thing i

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:32.240
associate with you know yes anybody who's hoping for some kind of uh what can i say uh dark erotic

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:38.640
buzz is is it's far more likely to get yeah is it i don't associate burlesque and as you brought it

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:44.560
and made it popular in cardiff with salacious material far more with belly laughing and grinning

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:50.960
and and cheering at the people joining in and supporting there's there's nothing you know the

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.360
dirty macro brigade are never going to fight they're never going to get their kicks through

00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:02.000
through this art form it's it's it's you know no it's it's far more loving and warm and and uh

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:09.360
yes and humorous i mean if anything it mocks sexuality in in in that sort of carnival fool

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:15.120
for a day type routine it turns things on its head it does and and actually burlesque means satire

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:21.440
so that's what it's meant meant to mean and it you know it it can be dark i mean i've got some sort

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:28.160
of you know like the my pris act yes tris is dark and she's very she's a very erotic figure

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:35.440
which is completely untouchable um so so it's just it's playing is playing with and it's

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:42.560
what i love about the burlesque and the cabaret um format is it's rather like a carnival passing

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.720
you you've got you know something's in front of you it's there for five minutes and then something

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.880
else is coming along so if you don't like that no there'd be something else but so is a feast for

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.520
the eye it's the creativity the costumes you know as you say i mean you come on in a

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:03.280
a morphed sleeping bag as a cocoon it's like what you know how is this gonna and then very very

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:09.040
cleverly you know it moves on and and and a show where performance is given and uh you only have

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:14.160
to listen to the cheering at the end to know that yeah message given and understood you know yeah

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:19.920
and i think when you're going back to the group and the cohesiveness of the group what what really

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.800
keeps the us all going after eight years is the friendships and the connections that arise in

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.520
that group and what's interesting as a teacher and somebody who's leading these this troop along

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:35.200
is to see relationships develop within the group and little supporting networks develop within the

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:42.720
groups that have coped with cancer and bereavement and divorce and all sorts of stuff within within

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:50.640
that group um and i think that's i feel mentally proud of them for making those connections and

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:56.480
for making their world a bit brighter and giving themselves coping mechanisms with each other

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:05.600
so it is a little bit a self-help help group but it works very well on all sides um stef thank you

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:11.520
so much for that interview um i am pleased to declare on behalf of carnival that you are now

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:18.640
officially a carnival hero uh i'm sure you're going to accept this verbal award on behalf of

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:24.000
yourself and the uh the broader group which we still like the nickname because uh uh the burley

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.680
girls yeah the burley girls the burley girls uh will always be close to our carnival hearts

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.760
thank you very much indeed
