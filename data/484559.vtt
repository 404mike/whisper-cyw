WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
Here we go. Cardiff Cardiff Hall 25th Anniversary Project.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.360
interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewee Justine Goulding.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.960
The location is number one Yersinian Avenue in Pont Canna Cardiff.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.720
Today's date is the 21st of October 2015

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.480
and before we start Justine, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.400
That's J-U-S-T-I-N-E

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.200
G-O-U-L-D-I-N-G.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.240
Thank you very much. Well done, that's correct.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.600
So how did you first get involved in the Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.520
Well, I knew yourself and

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.640
so I wanted to get involved in some of the dance projects

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.480
that initially attracted me to the Swicker Carnival.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.920
And I joined the...

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.720
A group of fire dancers was the theme for it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.360
and we all had costumes made for us by some of the lovely people

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.120
and I had to go there every evening to learn how to dance this particular routine.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.200
And the carnival camp at that time would have been at Catay's Community Centre?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.960
Yes, that's right.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.120
And obviously the parade has followed various different routes during the years

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.240
but in that year we would have ended the parade with a choreographed piece of sorts

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.440
on the steps of the National Museum at night time

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.640
and generate a big, big audience.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.680
Do you remember any of that, being on the steps of the National Museum?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.600
Yeah, I do actually, yeah.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
I remember being up on the left hand side as you're looking at it

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.800
and standing up on the top steps looking down over everybody

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.080
and having brought large crowds with us from the whole parade as we walked through

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.640
and looking out over all the people and seeing all the smiling faces.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.160
So that was kind of carnival number one for you

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.720
but you were back the next year, less so as a dancer.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.320
What was your next role?

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.640
Yeah, when I came back the next time, I'm quite into the arts and I did a degree in art

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.200
so I decided I fancied doing one of the amazing costumes

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.400
and I wanted to have a backpack costume which is one of the larger ones

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.480
and I think the theme was, what was it, water or rain or something

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.960
but I ended up doing a massive umbrella larger than life

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.400
which I made out of withy sticks and had lots of rain coming down on the inside of it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.400
which all twinkled as I danced around underneath.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.600
Yeah, it was really good actually, when you get all the atmosphere when you're at the camp

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.080
at Cotets and everybody's getting all ready together

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.160
and jeeing each other up and finishing each other's face paints

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.280
and then somebody came along that year, I remember spraying everybody's shoes

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.280
so even their shoes were all...

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.280
Attention to detail, very important.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.280
Yeah, nothing was wrong.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.280
Took us a few years to discover that, didn't it?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.280
Yeah, it was lovely and then by the time everybody's got their faces done

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.480
and all their costumes on and the atmosphere was amazing before you start,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.600
everybody was really excited and just really looking forward to jeeing up the audience

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.160
as you go through the town and taking a weird, securitas route

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
which is bumping to different people all the time and they don't know that you're coming

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160
and they just hear the drums in the distance and then you turn up and they're like

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.160
taken over by this massive carnival with all these different people in various costumes

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.160
all going past and there's just like some kind of surreal event happening to them.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
It's great.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.160
Of course, Cotets Carnival was in your early role in Swicka in the mid-90s.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
You of course left your mark on Barry Carnival.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160
Can you remember a little bit about that for us?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
It was the lantern parade, wasn't it?

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160
So I think Terry Chin taught us all how to bend all the sticks

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.160
and make various lanterns which weren't going to catch fire as soon as we put a flame inside them

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.160
which I thought was amazing considering they're made out of wood and paper

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
the key ingredients for a little fire

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.160
but apparently Swicka didn't mind about that at the time and that was OK.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
But more importantly they had a hole in it.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
It was before health and safety was invented.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
It kind of was but it wasn't, was it?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
There's a little hole in the top so that they didn't burn

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
and that was the only thing you had to make sure that you had.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.160
You could have any shape or size you liked and you could have a number of candles inside.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.160
Whatever you did, wherever the flame was, there'd have to be an air vent at the top

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.160
so that the heat could escape out and wouldn't set the whole thing on fire.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.160
That was fun. I was working as one of the tutors then

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.160
helping all the little kids in Barry make their lanterns ready for the parade.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160
It was good.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.160
And of course your stint there with us at Caddickston House

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.160
you were saying was a small step in which ultimately became your creative career.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
Tell us more.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
Yeah, that's right.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.160
After having done that then they offered me some evening classes

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
teaching ceramics in Caddickston House

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.160
and that was the spur really for me to take on PGCE in art and design

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.160
and now I've been a teacher in secondary education for 16 years teaching art and design.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
So that sort of set me off on that path really.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.160
That's fantastic. Justine, can I just say I award you the title of Cardinal Hero.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160
Thank you very much indeed for those memories.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.160
Thank you.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.160
Ciao.
