Well, this guy is in his middle 70s, nearly 80. He was brought up in Trioin. His father

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:17.620
was a forester from the forester's dean. So he'd served a long apprenticeship as a woodsman.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:25.320
So he knew how to chop trees down and fashion things out of them. And he moved because the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.800
work was there and the pay was better. He moved, I think, in the 30s over here from the forester's

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:44.400
dean. And he got a job making pit props in the Navvy. Now, the pit props were made from pine tree

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:52.040
trunks. The miners liked those pit props as opposed to the steel ones because it would warn

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.320
them of a fall. So if the ground above that they were supporting it become unstable, it was unstable

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.920
slowly and the pit props would start to squeak and squeal. So they heard them start to squeak

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.760
and squeal. They got out quickly. That apparently saved many lives over the life of the pit. There

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.560
were quite a number killed, but it saved many lives in addition.
