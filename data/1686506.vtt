00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.320
A thank you to Heritage Lottery for funding this short project on memories of people who are from,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:24.960
lived in, a part of Butetown, Tiger Bay or Cardiff Docks. This episode is a brief conversation with

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.200
Peter Pepsi Findlayson. Oh yeah, that's true. Well, Pepsi is a nickname obviously. Well,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.280
so I was born here in Cardiff, down in old Tiger Bay. My mother was born here in Cardiff.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:52.560
My father was born in the western region of Jamaica. I lived here all my life.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:02.960
Yeah, so my mother is deceased now. My father, he died when I was one.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.440
I left him on a ship in Scotland, which I didn't know anything about him.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.760
That couldn't have been easy for your mom when, you know, when they're bringing you up. Was

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.440
they just you, Pepsi, or was they brothers and sisters? No, definitely, definitely, yeah.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:33.280
And I mean, she was, she was all through the wall, you know. But I, well, I lived with my mother,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:43.280
but I was with my grandmother. It was all from kind of Bay, so. So, what about school, mate?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.040
School, I went to, I was a family-born school, South Church Street, which, you know,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:05.040
from an infant, my father was 15. I went there, you know, and next to everybody, black and white,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.680
but I didn't say that. Yeah. All that, all through my school days, you know, and still

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.080
remain friends with a lot of them, you know, today, you know, and I made me true, you know.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.560
Yeah, I mean, religion and race didn't mean anything then, then? Well, no, not really,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.120
you know. Well, you know, we, well, we are the way different, you know, we just play together and,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.040
you know, go over together and, you know, we go over into the pub and drink together, you know,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.080
and it's been a really fancy and meaningful today, you know, with all the lives, you know.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.600
Well, well, when we, from the Bay over the bridge, like, you know, really sweet,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.240
there's a little bit of conflict, I mean, like, in Newtown,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:16.640
there's nothing, well, myself personally, you know, I, I got on with everybody, really, you know,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.080
conflict now and again, but nothing to really talk about.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:33.040
So back, back to the school, what about people talk about the Whitsun treat?

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.960
What about that? Well, the Whitsun treat was one of our pleasures, you know,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:50.880
um, it's, um, it's all this, it's sort of a, you know, the, the tents and, um, you know,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.240
college, and everything like, you know, and, you know, that was, um, you know,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.760
it was a great time, you know. Did you, did you go on the lorry trips?

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.360
Yes, yes, that's what I mean, you know, it's, uh, people, well, I do it myself,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.280
in the very, you know, when I grew up and worked, I've been a lorry driver, like, all my life,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.000
and, um, I actually, you know, the commissioners and the boss, and get the lorry and

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.400
do a bit of the Whitsun treats, like, you know, so I knew all about that, you know.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.720
Those early days, etc., what about families mixing and all that kind of stuff? Did, you know,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.680
was there a lot of, you know, going into people's houses and eating?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:54.000
Oh, oh, definitely, you know, I mean, well, you had millions of aunties and uncles, you know,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.920
according to different people's houses and, you know, eat some, you know, I mean, um,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:11.680
it was, well, I lived in four streets, you know, in the day, like, you know, my mother moved,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.200
you know, I was born in Angola in the street, then we moved to the fire street, then the

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.200
fancy street, you know, I lived with my granny in the house, you know,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.840
And when you got a bit older, what about music and going out?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:57.200
Sing the not Escrapac, you know, and, and then I was old enough,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.200
I go to different bars, tell us in the music.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.000
I run a club in Quebec, you know,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.300
that's why I go to hear about it.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.140
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.980
And I used to go listen to, you know,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.640
a very, well, I grew an attention,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.080
Victor Parker, you know,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.820
he played his guitar, and all of us.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.560
Another fella, Uncle Henry,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.120
I forget his other name, but the moment, you know,

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.480
he plays his guitar, he's mostly guitar, really.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.120
I mean, he's entirely guitar, long video.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.960
Yeah.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.120
You know, I'm trying to get up to the,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.480
that class club where, you know,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.420
they take their instruments, double bass,

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.360
an accordion, like on drums and everything,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.320
and listen to, you know,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.160
everything that all them people play,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.960
live reform, trumps, anything.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.880
And that's, yeah, so.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.680
Did you, I mean, you know, you mentioned the kayaks club.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.920
Did you ever play for the kayaks or anything?

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.560
Yes, yes.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.960
Yeah, so I played for the kayaks,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.960
and, well, I played with a few schools, you know,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.520
and from school, I played with the kayaks,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.640
you know, reached on tour to Ireland, you know,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.640
and then, oh, to different things like Carmel,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.040
and the memory event,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.360
and I still see a lot of the kayaks,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.640
so it's pretty great, you know,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.560
going to schools and everything, you know,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.360
with, well, and the punks and a lot of them, you know.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.760
There was a lot of talent in that team, wasn't there?

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.080
Yeah, there was, yeah,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.280
oh, we had a lot of talent from down here, like,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.520
you know, like boxers and, you know,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.720
we played like Billy Boston,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.520
Thoriskin,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.480
Bakhtin,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.320
Teddy Beats,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.960
and Faye Edwards, you know,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.400
well, we were all in the school together,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.360
and we played rugby together,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.160
and mixed and all the drink together, you know.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.560
Yeah, what about you and family, Petty?

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.520
Do you have-

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.360
My family?

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.560
Yeah, have you got family as well now, or whatever?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.400
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.240
myself and my wife, my daughter, my stepson, you know,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.840
and one, two, three, five grandchildren,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.120
a few, you know, the same as me right now,

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.640
during this, you know, this COVID,

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.360
you know, moving out and everything,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.240
so I'm still, still grumpy.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.320
It's a different,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.560
it's a different feeling being a granddad, isn't it?

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.160
You know, it's not like being a,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.720
it's different to being a dad,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.800
because you can be,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.880
you don't have all the responsibility,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.480
you can be a bit different.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.040
Well, yeah, I really,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.280
I really don't know about that,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.280
because I'm like that now, you know,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.600
and I got two more kids now,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.960
they're doing their work from school,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.800
you know, whatever they call it,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.240
Homework area, yeah.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.240
But, you know, they've been asking me

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.200
any answers I've ever had,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.000
because, you know, I forgot an old school,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.960
you know, except for what you're asking, you know?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.800
Yeah.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.840
What, I mean, what do you,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.520
what about the changes to the Bay and Bute Town

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.360
and the neighborhood?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.920
What do you think about that,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.480
the way everything's been knocked down and changed?

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.120
Well, you know, that's,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.440
I think it's terrible, you know,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.240
as regards to, you know, the housing and,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.440
and, well, when we were down at Bay,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.840
you know, they,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.760
that's when they just started building them

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.800
multi-story buildings and all that,

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.800
like, you know, I didn't like that,

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.040
because it dispersed a lot of families,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.360
like, you know, I mean, when it was the Bay,

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.360
I knew where everybody lived, you know,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.000
and now that they've gone and had all these facts,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.880
excuse me, I didn't know where anyone lived,

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.880
and then, you know, things like that.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.080
But, you know, I mean, where I live now

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.200
in Palma Street,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.360
as I said, I've been here now for like 45, 46 years.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.880
I know everybody, well, not everybody,

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.920
because people, different people moving in,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.720
but down here it's quite nice, you know,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.720
but up at Bay there now, I know, I know anyone, you know,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.480
when I grew up, you know,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.480
the shoes I live in, like, you know,

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.760
there was a lot of Samaritan people,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.320
those lovely, lovely people, you know,

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.840
you got boating houses, and people went into them

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.840
and have a cup of tea, or they make a pop, you know,

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.760
and they were invited to eat, you know,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.720
but I don't, well, I will tell you,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.960
I don't want the Bay at all now,

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.960
but, you know, when I was there,

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.800
you go into people's houses and eat,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.240
and, you know, like, what do they call them, cafes,

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.960
any, or boating houses, you know,

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.440
eat to them people, they've invited me to eat,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.960
but, you know, I don't want them now,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.440
so, but I don't want them in like that happens today,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.520
you know, I don't think so.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.760
And everybody, all of those, all of those people,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.680
even though they didn't have a lot of money,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.040
they always seemed to dress smart,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.880
do you know what I mean?

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.840
They always seemed to look after themselves.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.640
Well, yeah, they had their Sunday best, you know,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.240
and as I mentioned, shoe, you know,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.480
they've got the black ties and suits and everything,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.920
like, you know, but it's a funny difference,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.720
it's very, like, you know, I mean,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.160
I've been to quite a lot of shoe houses,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.160
I've always dressed myself, you know,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.720
in an additional way, with black ties,

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.000
suits and tights, and everything,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.960
but they just used casual things, you know, you know.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.120
Funerals, funerals always were a big thing

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.680
in the Bay, weren't they?

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.520
Do you know what I mean?

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.360
Always, yeah.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.520
Yeah, you know, yeah, and you know,

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.440
well, I work for the firm, you know,

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.440
and I just ask the boss, you know,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.000
I say, well, there's a funeral, you know,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.320
so he needs to make a joke for me,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.480
and, you know, there's anybody left, like, you know,

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.480
but I mean, there's people's mothers and grandmothers

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.920
and fathers, you know, and you're going up to them,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.920
and you tend to go to a mother or father

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.600
or grandfather's funeral, like, you know?

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.440
Yeah.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.920
And that's how it's always been, you know?

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.160
Oh, yeah.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.400
I mean, I, well, I mean, people have talked about stuff

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.640
like things like, you remember Chalky White's place,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.480
the center?

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.320
Yes, yes.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.920
I mean, did you have anything to do with that?

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.720
Did you ever go there or whatever?

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.720
Oh, I used to go there, yeah, as I go there, you know,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.960
I used, I used to just, you know,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.200
play games with table tennis or game a silver pool

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:12.160
or whatever, you know, and I never had a big interest in it,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.120
but I'd go there just to meet friends and everything.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.600
I knew Chalky White very well, you know?

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.160
People said he was an important man at the time

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.680
in terms of what he did for young people.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.080
What did you, what do you think?

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.800
Well, you know, I was saying, well,

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.080
I knew his name was Vivian White, you know?

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.920
Yeah.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.280
They called him Chalky, you know?

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.440
Well, we are calling him Chalky White.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.280
Yes.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.280
He was, he was a, he came running,

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.280
and, you know, he, if you wanna ask him anything, you know,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.320
he told him and he helped him to,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.400
if he could with anything, I mean,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.520
if he wanted to, I don't know, whatever.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.600
What do you call it?

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.280
Any inquiries.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.120
Yeah.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.800
Fill out any forms and all that kind of,

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.840
which, some things like that, you know?

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.960
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.160
And what about, you know, people have said, like,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.720
when they were at school, there were certain teachers

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.000
that were important to them.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.160
You know, some have mentioned Betty Campbell

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.120
and Owen Watkins and others, and I just wondered,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:30.960
what about you?

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.800
Were there any teachers?

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.880
You, you, you kind of,

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.720
that you recall?

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.240
Yeah, well, I used to live in the same house as Betty Campbell

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.400
when I was, when I was young, you know, very young,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.920
and I knew Owen Watkins very well.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.280
You know, the lady kind of teachers when I was,

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.160
you know, when I was at school, like, you know?

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.160
But I used to go to all them houses, regular, like, you know?

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.440
I mean, she was older than I was, and Betty Campbell,

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.480
but we made friends, and so, you know,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.240
they would, they passed away, which was reasonable, you know?

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.080
Yeah.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.560
And, and they were so good, the two of them,

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.800
which is that too, if you wanted to, you know,

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.120
fill out any forms, or say, you know,

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.880
let's say that they, they help you,

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.720
and you can help, you know?

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.360
So, um.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.160
I mean, what, if you were, you know,

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.800
imagine somebody's having a cup of coffee

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.920
in those new, those new places,

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.120
and down the, what they now call the Bay,

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.320
and it's a tourist, and they don't know anything

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.320
about the life that went on, you know, before.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.840
What would you say to them that they should know

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.280
about the people that lived, grew up,

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.760
and were in the Bay, and in Butetown?

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.200
What would you say to them, if you had a chance?

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.440
If I had a chance, I will.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.560
I mean, well, I was,

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.040
oh, I was brought up, you know, I mean,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.680
you know, well, our manners,

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.200
we respect the people, and,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.040
and that's what we were taught, you know?

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.960
And that's why I try to tell my grandchildren,

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.160
no, you know, we have to be respectful,

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.240
and, you know, something like that.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.080
Yeah.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.920
I try.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.880
I mean, all of, what about all of the,

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.040
you know, you said about, you know, music and that,

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.040
and all of the pubs, I think there's only the packet

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.480
that's left, isn't there?

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.440
You mean, you know, pubs, yes, um, yes.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.600
There's only a packet down here, no.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.800
I mean, um, I mean,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.280
the only thing when we used to all meet together,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.240
which is, but there's just pubs,

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.760
but you know, I think you see,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.400
they're all school friends, and, you know,

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.880
and people like that, but,

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.360
I don't think you can even do that in Great Nile.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.200
No.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.360
You know, or you can meet outside, or in a corner,

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.000
you know, I don't know where they live off it,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.960
or in their house and everything, and that's about it.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.800
Yeah.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.560
Right.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.080
Well, thank you, Pepsi, for sparing some time with me.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.920
I'm grateful, mate.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.760
Yeah.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.280
And it's nice to hear your memories, as I say.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.240
Well, I hope, you know, I mean,

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.760
I'm a bit forgetful, you know,

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.960
but I do try.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.840
We're still around, man.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.520
The thing is that we're still around.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.640
Yeah, you know, yes.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.240
There were times when we were younger,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.080
we more than likely would have thought,

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.360
I'll never get to be there at these ages.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.080
Well, I would say,

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.560
82, you know, type of athlete,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.480
that's what I would like to do.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.680
You know, but, well,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.920
too bad.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.920
Well, I said again, I was wondering why you asked me here,

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.800
because I'm not too swift myself, really,

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.840
but I do try.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.680
Yeah.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.440
I mean, when all's said and done,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.400
if somebody had said to you 60 years ago,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.720
you'll have children, and you'll have grandchildren,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.720
and two of them will be sitting in your place,

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.920
doing their own work.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.400
You might not believe them, but, you know.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.200
No, no, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.960
But now I know how true it is.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.800
You know, now,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.680
my younger sister's father,

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.440
truly not a nurse,

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.200
but in the school, I know,

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.880
and as I say, the truth,

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.320
and my kids know, and they're confused, you know,

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.480
in their work, so.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.080
It's a lovely feeling having them, isn't it?

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.760
Oh, the best in the world.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.480
The best in the world, you know.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.920
I live extremely alone,

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.960
and every morning, you know,

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.520
I think of the day, you know,

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.040
I see my wife, and then I go on the bed,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.120
and I can't go to the bathroom,

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.120
because they get on my nerves,

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.720
but, you know, I'm just terrible.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.560
Yeah.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.680
Well, all I'd say is, man,

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.720
just keep telling them,

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.240
because those memories, those memories of,

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.400
it's the same as you and your mum,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.400
those memories of the conversations you had with them,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.360
they're precious, aren't they?

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.320
You know, when you...

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.200
Oh, no, definitely.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.880
Yeah, most definitely.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.840
Right.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.960
Well, thank you, sir,

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.920
for spending some time with me.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.160
I'm grateful.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.960
I hope I've done it.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.800
I hope that I did.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.640
You've been fine.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.880
You've been fine, man.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.720
Yeah.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.560
Oh, thank you very much.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.400
Okay.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.520
Good to speak to you.
