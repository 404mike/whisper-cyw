Thou well-loved in thy holy voice,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Tread with the ones that have been close,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000

Thou well-loved in thy high-roy.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I hold the grave, I hide the grave.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I hold the grave, I hide the grave.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.000

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I am army, free on from all men.
