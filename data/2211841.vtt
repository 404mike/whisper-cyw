00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
A few weeks ago now, isn't it?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
A few weeks ago.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It was a lovely sunny day.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Yeah, so what would you like to tell us about?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yeah, you know last time I discussed the,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
it's a wood mirror and I saw a lot of things like

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
bad light, iron, coil, iron, and pocket bag and everything.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And a little bit explain about these things

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because when I saw these things and my back,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
childhood memories, remembers once again

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and when I saw these things, I feel very happy.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And my faced expression is totally changed.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I'm feeling relaxed and comfortable.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And like these things, when I saw, I feel it's my own home.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Yeah.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So with the mirror, you told us a bit about the mirror.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Yeah.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Is there anything else you'd like to tell us about the mirror?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's start with the mirror.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Is there, for example, a particular event

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
or something that happened with the mirror?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You were talking about how you used to study in front of the mirror,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
sing and talk in front of the mirror.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Is there anything, any other memories of being in front of the mirror

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that you want to share with us?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Yeah, most of the time I'm talking with mirror

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and I'm standing in front of mirror.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
A lot of when I'm feeling sad and sometimes I am crying in front of mirror.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And a lot of crying and then I'm feel,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and talk myself in front of mirror.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And I feel happy and relaxed and give it my all.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
No, you calm down. Yeah.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So it was a way for you to kind of calm yourself down?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Yeah, calm down. And most of the time I'm talking with mirror.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
What kind of things would you talk about?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Like myself, like when my negative thoughts come in my mind

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and then I'm told everything in front of mirror.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And then it's cool. Yeah.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Because mirror is my best friend, in another words.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Yeah, that's really lovely.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Could you tell us anything else about the mirror?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Is there anything else you'd like to add?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Maybe about how it made you feel?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Nothing, nothing.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You know, always my mom worried about mirror

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
because I'm a lot of uses and my mom,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and then because it's my mom's wedding gift.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Yeah, anything more.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Was it common to give a mirror as a wedding gift?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Yeah, yeah, because this mirror, like my mom wedding,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Yeah.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So why is it different?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Like another mirror is a simple and everything.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It is a simple wood and then is like a small drawers

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and open and some beauty like jewelry, jewelry put in the box

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and everything is a totally different

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
because now these traditions and yeah.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But now this time is a very like a different style,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
but like a past and like not same mirror.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So the one in St. Pagan's, it looked the same or it looked different?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Same, same, yeah.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
You know, when I'm sorry and then when I first like look this mirror

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and just to go back my home, like, oh, it's my mirror.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Yeah, it's a very nice memory and I feel very happy.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Yeah, I do.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Yeah, sometimes I do makeup in front of mirror

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and then sometimes I make a TikTok videos in front of mirror

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and then nothing.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Yeah.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
What did you enjoy about doing makeup in front of the mirror and TikToks?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
What was fun about that?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Yeah, like I easily handle the mirror because it's a small and not too much big

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and then I do makeup and I feel happy.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Yeah.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Nothing more.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000

Yeah.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And because it's very cheap.

Yeah, it's too much heavy one time when I'm saying, Oh, what is this?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
It's an iron for pressing the clothes and everything.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And okay, it's a too heavy.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:08.000

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
in childhood.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And then it's too heavy.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
You know, it's not for you.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
This one.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Is there anything else you want to tell us about the pocket bag?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Yeah, tell us.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
So.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Actually, it's a clocked bag.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
It's a clocked bag.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Yeah.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
It's a clocked bag.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
It's here now.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
It's a tote bag.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Yes.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
It's from the leather.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
It's a clocked bag.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Yeah.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Handmade.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
So that's the one your grandma had.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Yeah.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Yeah, because my grandma is free every time and she's doing something.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
It's like a embroidery and made up like a hand pocket.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Yeah.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Great.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
It's like a sweater.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
It's handmade.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:40.000
And every time she's doing, my grandma is feeling bored and then she's doing.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
So she made things because she was bored.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Crochets.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Yeah, crochet.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Was the bag crocheted?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
No, nothing like crochet.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Crochet, crochet like shirts, sweaters in a winter gift.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.000
And when winter is coming and my grandpa is like a crochet made a sweaters, handmade sweaters.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
And then knitting.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Sorry, knitting.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
And knitting a sweaters and everything.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Yeah.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And then the cap is gloves and the sweater is a baby shoes, handmade baby's gloves, baby's

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
sweater, baby's proper suit.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Yeah.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
So she would make all of those things.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Yeah.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
When you were younger and you saw your grandma making things, what did you think?

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
What did you feel?

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Can you remember?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Yeah, I'm always like I have a lot of cousins and always fighting.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.000
When winter is coming and my grandpa knitting like some bodies is a sweaters, is a gloves,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
cap and everything and every cousin.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
You ready for me and you ready for me.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
And then my grandma always, okay, okay, okay.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
I do this.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
I do this.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:14.000
At that time, my grandpa made his son a knot for our, yeah.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Can you repeat the last bit?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000
He saw a son like a knot for me, a knot for cousin.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
What was knot for your cousin?

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Because we are always fighting and my grandpa, if she made for me and another cousins maybe

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
feel racist for me and so.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
So because you were fighting all the time.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Yeah.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
He said no one has anything.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:50.000
When winter is coming, it's six months like my mom is sitting in a bed and then he's a

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:59.000
lot of different color is like a crochet and knitting the sweaters and gloves, cap and

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
And then me and my other cousins, my grandma, please.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Grandma made for me cap or gloves and everything.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
And my grandma is a smiley face.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000

My grandpa when his meeting is a very smiley face and he's a very hardworking for me because

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:34.000
I see this is a very like a conscience and then is a pick the different color.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
It's designing.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
