00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
What we're trying to do with this small short series of podcasts is to

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.200
Give the listener an idea about

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.360
Tiger Bay

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.480
Butetown

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.480
Cardiff docks and

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.040
The people the places and the culture that makes

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.640
That area so important in terms of Wales Cardiff and generally

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.040
We'd like to say thank you from us at HDA for Heritage Lottery for their support

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.520
That's enabled us to undertake this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
these this work

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.960
This brief podcast is about an area within

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.960
Butetown

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.000
Mount Stewart

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.080
Mount Stewart Square

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.840
It's a residential and commercial square in Cardiff is located in the Butetown area of the city

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320
Originally it was developed in the late

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.020
1800s as a residential location for nearby dock workers

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.640
But it quickly changed to a center for upscale residential properties

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.780
Which revolved around the main square?

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.700
By 1900 commercial activity had taken its place

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.780
dominated by the coal exchange which took a piece of land away from

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.540
Mount Stewart Square and

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.220
That because it occupied the once open central space

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.020
The square contains a high

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.780
concentration of listed buildings which represent a range of

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.740
Articulate our architectural styles and some of Cardiff's finest examples of the late

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
19th and early 20th century

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.260
commercial architecture

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.800
Mount Stewart Square area was designated a conservation area in July

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.700
1980

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.900
The area which Mount Stewart currently occupies was originally coastal mudflat in its in its present form

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.020
It is an urban area bordered by the the road the a4 119

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.980
James Street a major road to the south

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.100
early 20th century search or social housing to the north and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.220
On a site which had previously been used as a rail route rail yard

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.180
historic commercial properties to the west on West Bute Street and the historic

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.860
Glamorganshire Canal

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.860
to the east

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.380
the Glamorganshire Canal was drained in December 1951 when a

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.780
steam suction dredger crashed into the inner lock gates

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.100
Forcing them to collapse and all the water was released into the estuary

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.540
that actually resolved a problem for the council because

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.900
They didn't know what to do with it and it was too expensive to

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.700
to resolve its faults

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.340
Well, the gates were never repaired and for a number of years the canal remained dry

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.260
Until the land was filled in and converted to parkland

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.060
namely

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.420
Canal Park the square lies approximately half a mile to the south of Loudoun Square

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.100
Which was also built as a residential square, but never actually developed into a commercial hub

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.540
It junctions with James Street and West Bute Street

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.180
Provides vehicle access to the square and pedestrian access exists to the parkland to the west

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.380
The square has one-way traffic system which vehicles enter the junction with James Street

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.740
etc

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:04.540
Mount Stewart Square has a distinctive form with buildings on four sides facing the Cardiff Coal Exchange in the centre

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.260
It is not a square in the true sense

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.660
because the building there was limited by the physical restrictions of

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.980
the canal

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.300
Now Mount Stewart Square is closely linked to its its development is closely linked to that the coal industry in South Wales

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.460
the mining of coal in the South Wales valleys in the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:32.620
1790s onward meant that card developed into a port through which the coal was shipped and exported worldwide

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.700
It was initially transported using the Glenorchinshire Canal and later by rail on the Taft Vale Railway

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.460
Both of which terminated close to the site of the square a number of docks were constructed to

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.820
Filosylate the movement of this coal and the entire Bute town area of Cardiff was transformed to accommodate the new industry

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.300
and by the 1830s

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.580
Cardiff became the preeminent iron exporting port

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.380
shipping almost half of Britain's overseas iron exports between

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.220
1840 and

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.620
1870 and

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.540
then coal began to dominate and

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.300
the population of the area increased accordingly and

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:26.380
The grid pattern residential suburb for port related workers was built on land which included the site of the square

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.140
Now Mount Stewart Square was constructed in

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.060
1855 as a very select resident residential enclave around ornamental gardens

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:47.060
merchants and sea captains and originally consisted of 45 stuccoed three-story townhouses

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:55.380
The land was originally mud fat, but later the Cardiff glassworks had partly occupied the area as

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.260
A result the underlying soil was a mixture of mud and slag from the glass which

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.700
Which required 30 feet of concrete shafts to be constructed

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.940
That rested on a bed of hard gravel in order to construct the foundations of the square

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:21.300
In the period immediately before construction of the square commenced the land was used as a stables for canal horses

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.820
Named after Lord Mount Stewart the area was the vision of the second Marquis

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.820
John Crichton Stewart

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.940
Second Marquis of Bute who wanted to create a grand Georgian space to rival

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.740
Barclay Square in London

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.380
The development of the square was part of his vision to transform

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
Cardiff into a major port

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:54.300
improve the value of his own lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.800
As the docks rose in prominent wealthy residents moved out and it became a commercial centre

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.980
the construction of the coal exchange building

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.860
Solidified the change in focus to commercial and it became central to the coal trade activity

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.780
the coal exchange area meant that

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:22.260
Those of the original townhouses not converted were replaced by purpose-built offices for coal and shipping agents

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.300
The

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.740
Building surrounded the coal exchange housed coal companies banks and agents

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.500
most of

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.540
Cardiff's notable architects of the period are represented

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
including Alexander roots

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:46.020
architect of the Bute state Edwin Seward EWM Corbett Percy Thomas and Henry Budging

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.140
The impact of World War one was significant on the square

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.460
Having a damaging effect on the coal industry

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:02.020
By 1921 only six of the 52 companies operating in 1898 were still in business

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.620
with the industry never recovering

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.460
The coal exchange closed

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:16.340
Which in reduced which in turn reduced the demand for commercial premises on the square and allowed boarding houses to be established

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:22.060
And by the early early 20th century all banks had vacated their properties on the square

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.860
The western side of the square saw a gradual demolition of original properties and by the

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:35.780
1990s was no longer enclosed on its border with a canal much of the land was being used at open-air car parks

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:42.860
Until the construction of st. James and st. Stephen's mansions which once again enclosed the square

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:49.860
Mount Stewart Square has been home to a number of religious buildings in addition to its function as a

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.620
residential and commercial space the only remaining building st. Stephen's Church

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.140
designed by architect E.M. Bruce Bourne and constructed between

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.980
1900 and 1902

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.220
It's located at the junction with West Bute Street

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.140
Designed in a gothic style the parish was deconsecrated in

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.980
1992

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.980
between

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:22.540
2003 and 2009 the building was used as a live music as a live music venue called the Point

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:29.780
The Bethel English Baptist Church located near the South Summit entrance to the square was built in

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.540
1858 and renovated in

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:38.460
1898 and again in 1910 it was built in the classical and

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:45.900
Lombardic Italian style over two stories and was the location of Ivan Avello's baptism

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.700
the chapel closed in

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:56.620
1965 and the Casa Blanca Club operated from the site from 65 to 85 it was demolished in the

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.660
1990s

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:05.380
The Siloam West Baptist Chapel in the northeastern corner next to Lloyds Bank was opened in

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.140
1859 but in

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.980
1902 converting into a commercial building known as Phoenix House

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.140
Which retained the majority of the original building except the front wall

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:23.300
The Mount Stewart Welsh independent chapel now demolished was built in

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.020
1858 and rebuilt in

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.740
1864

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.780
So that's a very brief history of Mount Stewart Square

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:38.120
Which has been many things but has always been pretty central

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.740
to

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.100
Cardiff Docks, the Tiger Bay and Bute Town and

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.980
Also, it's always been pretty elegant. It's just a personal opinion

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.900
But the Casa Blanca Club

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.820
Was pretty good place to go as well
