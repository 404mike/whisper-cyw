00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, Fandedno, and I'm going to talk to

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.280
Mike Goodall about his family memories during the war, particularly his mother.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.280
Thank you, Mike.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.880
My mother, she was, as I say, born in, brought up in Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire in

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.540
the Midlands, the brewery town, and during the war, I know the first year of the war,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:34.340
she went as a land army girl down in Devon, and after that she returned home and then

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:42.140
became a member of the NAFI, based at Alton Towers in Staffordshire, and from what I know,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:50.700
it was mainly a training base for Canadian airmen, as there was one or two airfields

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.580
in the Midlands, particularly one at Fradley in Staffordshire, where at St Stephen's Church

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.900
there are many Canadian airmen who are buried in the churchyard there.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.020
And I know my mother had four, from what I know, from what she said, that she had four

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.780
happy years in the NAFI.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.340
She was only about 20 miles away from home, so it wasn't too far away from home, but

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.620
they had certain events, and as I think to say, it was quite an experience, but quite

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.820
an enjoyable time that she had.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.820
It was an American base, was it?

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.820
Yes, Canadian.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.820
Canadian.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.420
So did she have those privileges of having bananas and oranges and sweets and chewing

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.060
gum, which a lot of people have mentioned to me?

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:46.060
Yes, yes, as I say, although they were mainly under campus, but they were quite well looked

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.580
after, and as I say, it wasn't particularly, from what she told me, it wasn't a hard time,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.660
but it was a lot of work and very hard work, long hours.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.620
Yes, because she would have had these three meals a day.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.620
Yes, yes.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.620
And good meals too.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.980
So was she a cook or was she, do you know what she did?

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.980
Just general, she's actually served in the NAFI, in the canteen for setting everything

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.980
up and then obviously all the washing up and everything else that went with it.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.100
And then she met your father later.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.100
Yes, yes.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.940
He had also been through the war.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.020
My father was in the Royal Artillery and was initially in North Africa with the Eighth

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.100
Army, with the Rommel Brigade, and he was actually carrying, most of the time, he was

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.580
carrying ammunition, so it was a very dangerous job.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.220
He was transporting ammunition to the front lines in North Africa.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.580
And then the last year of the war, as it started to go, they were moved up into Italy, because

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.100
Italy then was with the Germans and they were pushing the Germans out of Italy, starting

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.740
down in Sicily and then moving north in North Africa.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.580
And he spent five years, five years altogether, he had the whole five years.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.540
Five years and he came back unabashedly.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.540
Came back safely, yes.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.980
And they got married after.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.980
Yes.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.980
That's such a lovely story.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.340
Thank you so much for sharing it with me, particularly about your mother, because we

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.380
want to know about the women during the war, possibly they're not mentioned very often.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.700
So thank you so much.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.700
Thank you.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.700
Thank you.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.700
Pleasure.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.700
I think we've forgotten to ask your mother's name, so perhaps you can tell me what she was called.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.700
Yes, my mother's name was Doris Oldham, sorry, Doris Mabel Oldham.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.700
Well, it's lovely that we're remembering her today.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.700
Thank you very much.
