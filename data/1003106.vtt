00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Ranton, will you come forward now and tell about remembering Ranton?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My grandfather, Morgan Williams, I can hear the way they pronounce it now, came from Mercer-Tidfill and he came to Pennsylvania.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The only instructions he had was, find Mr. Davies.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, he found Mr. Davies and Mr. Davies decided to come on to Tacoma, Washington to work in the coal mines.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.000
When my grandfather was situated at Burnett, which was a little railroad stop, he brought over his wife and five children from Wales.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There were four boys and a girl, Hannah, Richard, Thomas, David, and Gomer, my father.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now, if you think that isn't fun to look this all up in a genealogy record, well, you know what that's like.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I want to stop at this time and introduce to you Richard's daughter, Delia.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Delia.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Well, two years later, Morgan died of pneumonia and was buried in Carbonado.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The boys went to work in the mines and at an early age and the family survived.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now, picture their miners caps and lamps and their black faces and the shining white of their eyes.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.000
My other grandfather, Calvin Benton, from whom I got my name, came from the silver mines of Colorado to supervise the sluicing down a beacon hill to form Harbor Island.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
His daughter, Julia, and my father, Gomer, were married and settled in Renton.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I was born in 1914 during the World War I and placed in a shoebox.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
At that time, the Renton coal mine, where my dad worked, was owned by the Strain family, who owned a Stanley steamer automobile.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Besides making a home, my mother played the piano for the silent films, she said, sometimes holding me on her lap.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
My dad favored the audience with a song or a clarinet solo at intermission.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Picture Renton's wooden buildings, boardwalks, and muddy streets at that time.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The mine was located at the edge of the valley a mile south of town and I attended the Henry Ford School nearby.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The Benson Road now goes over the mine entrance just south of where 405 makes its turn against the East Hill.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
There, on the valley floor, was a huge slag heap that we could look down on from our home in the hill.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
As a preschooler, I could watch the trams crawling up the slag mountain to dump its load.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The mine whistle announced the hours and I called it a foo-foo. My mother and dad were quite proud of that.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I especially remember it on November 11th, 1918, as it celebrated the Armistice.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The slag mountain has since been removed and now in its place one finds that transformer power station down there in Renton.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The mine tunnels were lit with carbide lamps and burrowed under the East Hill where we lived.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Our gang of young boys would explore the woods and find the air shafts, or cave-ins as we call them, that lead down into the damp tunnels.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And we would dare one another to climb down into them.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Sometimes a steamy, smelly gas would come out and we would cringe back in horror.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Picture all those residences on the East Hill, honeycomb with tunnels under them.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The Elf Club, for example.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I'm not making this up, you know.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:17.000
My dad got himself out of the mines by becoming a motorman on an interurban that operated between Seattle, Tacoma, and Everett with a spur line that came into Renton.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:30.000
His brother worked on the Puget Sound, I think Bill called it, Puget, what do you call it? Pacific Coast Railroad, right, that hauled the coal around the area.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
As with many Welsh, they came to America to escape the unemployment then developing in the Ronsa Valley.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And they expected to settle in Welsh communities to enjoy their Calvinist religion and Welsh culture.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
But it wasn't to be.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
The Welsh found that they had to get along with all the other ethnic groups as well, you see.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So, I can still remember a little Welsh girl that helped with long division in the grade school.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And I can remember Mr. Crawford's Presbyterian Church where we went to play in the orchestra.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And I can remember Reverend Green's Methodist Church where I went to Sunday school.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And Thomas Harry, the postmaster who taught me Sunday school lessons and how to get merit badges.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And, well, let's see, I remember 1929 when that all came to an end. Thank you.
