00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880
The year is 1933, the 10th of March. It is six weeks since the Nazis seized power in

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.400
Germany. Dr Michael Siegel, a Jewish lawyer in Munich and father of B Siegel, is going

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.200
about his business.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:32.000
My father went to the police headquarters, I suppose, in order to lay a complaint on

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.840
behalf of one of his clients who had been arrested. When he got to the police headquarters,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.880
somebody said to him, Dr Siegel, you're wanted in room number so and so, which happened to

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.040
be in the basement, and my father said, fine, I'm in good time, I'll go there first. And

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:58.160
he got there, he saw that it was full of brown shirt thugs who proceeded to beat him up.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.720
They knocked his teeth in and bust his eardrums. They then cut off his trouser legs and took

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:14.040
off his shoes and socks and hung a placard round his neck with the legend, I'm a Jew

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.760
and I will never again complain to the police.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.280
March 1938, Germany annexes Austria. A young Evelyn Kaye remembers the moment.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.160
But I think what I remember most is that I've hated the crowd ever since and I don't go near

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.480
the crowd and the marching of boots. It's everyone here marching now, still get uptight.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.000
Between 1933 and 1939, 90,000 Jews fled from Central Europe to Britain. Men, women and children

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.080
targeted by the Nazis as racially inferior, forced to abandon their homes in Germany, Austria and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.840
Czechoslovakia to seek refuge in the UK. Many of them found sanctuary in Wales, some briefly,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.520
others for the rest of their lives. In this podcast, we look at the connections between

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.200
the Holocaust and Wales. We listen to the stories of those who fled from Nazi tyranny

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.080
to build better lives for themselves and their families in Wales. We learn about their

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.080
contributions to Welsh life, culturally, economically and politically. And we hear

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.480
the testimony of Welsh people who bore witness to the barbarism of the Nazi regime.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.920
The Holocaust can seem like a distant event that happened a long time ago in another place,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.840
but it is a part of all of our history. It's a history that is more relevant now than ever,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.280
with the rise of the far-right, anti-Semitism, racism and attacks on human rights becoming

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.560
more common in many countries. I'm Maurice Brodie, historian at Aberystwyth University.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.720
The podcast has been created as part of Holocaust Resources Wales, a project between the Centre for

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.320
the Movement of People at Aberystwyth University and the Jewish History Association of South Wales

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.320
and sponsored by the Association of Jewish Refugees. The voices you will hear are those

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.080
of survivors or their children, recorded as part of oral history interviews taken by the Centre

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.040
for the Movement of People, the Jewish History Association of South Wales and Imperial War Museums.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.520
In this first episode, we look at Jewish life in Central Europe before the Second World War.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.040
The stories we will hear are those of refugees who fled to Wales in the 1930s.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.680
What were their lives like before they left? How did this change over the course of the decade?

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.840
And what was the spark, the writing on the wall, that prompted them to flee?

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.240
Let's start with the story of a young German Jewish boy. As a teenager, he will live in a

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:11.960
castle in North Wales. His name is Herman Rothman. Yes, I was born on the 2nd of September 1924

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.960
and I was born in Berlin. They sent me to a Jewish school and I had quite a distance to travel. I

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:30.360
traveled by train for about half an hour. It was what they call a Volksschule and it was a Jewish

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.800
one and we had a Hebrew education. I had a Hebrew education early date. I went to also to a sports

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:47.000
club called the Bakochpa. The Bakochpa was, apart from doing gymnastics in winter and in summer,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.640
we did athletics. I liked it very much indeed because when you're good at something,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.840
you like it more than anything else. Evelyn Kaye will attend boarding school in Belf Wells in

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.040
Poys. Her grandparents in Vienna ran a small theater. And the nursery put on the play

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.840
and I was a lily which had, my mother made me the dress and it had these leaves made out of

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.640
clay paper and it was quite sweet. It was a bit twee. There was the winter fairy and she had a

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.240
long tail and all the flowers were hidden under the tail and then she walked off stage. Each flower

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:35.240
got up and had a little yarn to say and unfortunately my, an anchored one who was much

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.480
older than I was, told me some naughty words to say and I couldn't remember the proper words.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.120
So my grandfather wrote down the curtain rather quickly.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.280
Renata Collins, whose name when she was born in 1933 in Prague was Renata Cress,

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.200
had parents from both Germany and Czechoslovakia.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.200
She was later fostered by a couple in Porth in South Wales. Well of course my parents

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:14.600
weren't born in Czechoslovakia. My father was born in Germany because his father came to Prague

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.520
to work in the bank and my father followed in his footsteps and then my mother was born in Bohemia

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:30.200
and she has pictures which everybody asks me was she an actress but no because that's how they

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.640
dressed in Bohemia and I suppose now we look at people and they're dressed way out and we think

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:44.440
oh they're a bit Bohemian and so she was a theatre sister in the Prague Hospital Infirmary whatever

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:51.240
they called it. Des Goulton moved to Treforest near Ponta Pryd with his family in 1939.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.640
He used to attend Jewish services with his grandparents in Zelina which is now part of

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:06.360
Slovakia. My grandfather and my maternal and my paternal grandparents were reasonably religious,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:15.240
not all were religious but reasonably and they went every Saturday to the service and they took me

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:24.920
so I went there also and many of my friends, my school friends, my school colleagues

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:34.280
came also to the service. Others like Evelyn Kaye remember a secular non-religious Jewish life.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:41.640
I lived in the Prater, the lower Paltstaff which was a Jewish district. My parents weren't

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.320
tably Jewish, they went kosher, they never went to synagogue and we didn't keep any of the festivals.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:54.760
And funny enough that my father's sisters were very religious and one of them got a bit

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.640
apprehensive because I was being caught up in this very godless way.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:08.120
Soon however these children became targeted because of their Jewish heritage. When the Nazis

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:14.360
seized power in Germany in 1933, open anti-Semitism became a state-sponsored policy.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.200
Let's hear Bea Siegel who became Bea Green again. I think it was in my second year at

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:30.280
primary school, at the state primary school, that unlike the first year we had a teacher

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:36.200
whom I still remember she was called Freula and Felna and she was anti-Semitic. I didn't know what

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:42.360
it meant of course at the time but she said when I asked for, I think it was an exercise book,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:48.280
can't you Jew kids get your own exercise books? And I thought yes, I'm sure we could. And I went

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.360
home to my mum and I said Freula and Felna thinks that we Jew kids could or should get our own

00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:01.240
exercise books and it was only then when I noticed that my mother was angry that I thought well maybe

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:07.080
she shouldn't have said that. Bea was later evacuated twice to Wales during the war.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:15.000
Laura Confino was also evacuated to Wales but lived in Frankfurt in Germany during the Nazi rise to

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.320
power. As far as I remember I enjoyed going to school and I had friends and it was all very nice

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:34.120
and at that time my mother was still alive and she and my form teacher were very good friends

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:42.360
because they were both very interested in books and so on and so it was a very nice atmosphere

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:50.520
but then as Hitler came into power things started to change and that is that the

00:09:51.320 --> 00:10:00.760
teacher whose name was Herr Knauf I remember sort of absent it himself. He didn't gradually,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:09.320
he didn't want to know my mother or my father anymore and at school itself every morning when

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:16.760
we turned up in class there was the picture of Hitler on the wall above the pulpit and we had

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:24.200
to stand there with outstretched arms and say hi Hitler and the atmosphere changed completely

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:33.960
and friends I had been sort of going to their houses and we were always together playing

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:42.840
and suddenly they didn't want to know me anymore and so obviously you found it very hard to

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:49.720
understand why should it happen that one day we were good friends and the next day they didn't

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:57.800
want to know anymore. The Nazis began arresting their political opponents and Jews and sending

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:04.360
them to detention centers known as concentration camps. These camps were outside the German legal

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:11.000
system meaning detainees could be held indefinitely. Hermann Rothman remembers his first encounter

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.400
with them after a family friend was arrested. We had friends who were of German extraction

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:27.080
but Jewish and they were very friendly. He was an architect and that on one occasion

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:37.800
the door opened and the woman came in and she cried and my parents asked her in and so on,

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:45.560
give her a drink and so on and what happened and she said they arrested her husband and they took

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:57.160
him to concentration camp. Now my parents consoled her and said well perhaps after a time they would

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:03.640
release them and everything will be all right and she left and then shortly afterwards then

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:10.520
it was another knock in the door and she was in absolute tears and she showed them a letter which

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:16.600
said if you from person in charge of the concentration camp saying it be informed you hereby that your

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:23.080
husband has had a heart attack and he died would you send us eight marks so that we can bury him

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:32.040
or commit him. That's the letter which she showed us and of course she was in tears and so there I

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:41.000
felt the first effect of death by the Nazis. The Nazis soon had designs beyond the German borders.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:49.080
In 1938 they invaded Austria and proclaimed it a part of Germany. This was the Anschluss. Hans

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:56.360
Albrecht who later lived in Llandudno remembers soldiers walking past his house in Linz. Yeah I

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:02.280
passed past my house and I remember the wine list and women people raising their heads,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.920
lifting their hands and throwing lots of flowers to the Nazis. And Mrs. Wine Lister,

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.640
a Nazi, she told that the lady who came to Walshcross, she said don't Walshcross with

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:21.320
dirty swine, the Jews. I remember that as well. In November 1938 the situation for German and

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:27.560
Austrian Jews worsened dramatically. A Polish Jew living in Paris, Herschel Grinspan,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:34.440
assassinated a German official. In response a wave of violence was unleashed against the Reich's

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:42.440
Jewish population. Shops were smashed, synagogues burned down and 30,000 Jews were rounded up and

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:49.640
sent to concentration camps. The night of the 9th and 10th November became known as Kristallnacht,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:59.640
the night of broken glass. Laura Confino. And then for me personally the climax came at Kristallnacht

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:11.000
which was the 10th of November 1938 when they came to us with long iron bars and my father stood at

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.840
the front door and he had pinned his iron crosses and his decorations on his lapel

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:25.960
and he thought that would show them that he had fought in the war and they would leave us alone.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:34.120
But they pushed my grandparents and my father and myself, my brother had left by then to France,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:43.960
into the kitchen and they started smashing up our home and obviously there was a lot of noise and

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.000
we were all frightened and my grandmother thought we were all going to be killed.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:57.960
And then after they'd finished what they wanted to do they left and suddenly it was all quiet

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:05.960
and we sort of came out of the kitchen and when I saw what our home looked like and it was all

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:16.360
cluttered up and smashed up and it looked awful and I remember I looked around and I said to my

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:25.320
father I'm not going to stay here and I walked out and they tried to keep me back because they

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:31.800
didn't know what was going on in the street and so on but I just felt I can't stay here.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.240
The pogrom took place all over the German Reich including Austria. Evelyn Kay and Hans Albrecht

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:47.720
Well I remember the boots again we lived on a second floor flat and the knocking on the door

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:54.840
and they took my father and then they marched up in the block of flats and they took other people

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:02.680
who never came back. Well I remember the Nazis came to my house to arrest my father

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.040
and when they came to my house I said to my mother are the wicked people here again

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.560
and they took all the jewelry out of her house. Julius Weill who later moved to Merthyr Tidful

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:20.440
had celebrated his Bar Mitzvah to synagogue in Cologne just two weeks earlier. It was the last

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:27.000
Bar Mitzvah to take place at the synagogue before it was destroyed. Well I wasn't out and about when

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:39.880
it happened but all the sort of Jewish businesses in Cologne were smashed up, windows broken,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:53.720
more or less closed down. My synagogue, well all the synagogues were trashed, burned and smashed up.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:05.720
The school I went to which was sort of attached to one of the synagogues was also completely destroyed.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:13.000
Herman Rothman's family had been hiding with a relative on the outskirts of Berlin on the night of the pogrom.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:21.480
We came back and we went we traveled to Berlin and we saw the havoc which was made of Jewish

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:30.520
properties. We saw the shops being the glass destroyed, everything looted from these from

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:37.880
the shops and so on. It was a dreadful sight for a child, I was a child really, to see all this

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:46.360
and to observe it. In a bid to humiliate them further the Nazis made Jews clean up the mess.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:56.600
Evelyn Kay. My mother who never learned any sense, the Nazis got rid of the Jews you know when they

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:04.280
were scrubbing the streets with toothbrushes and tried to pull her away and she wouldn't come

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.920
so they got her out of her to scrub and all these people were then deported to a concentration camp.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:19.160
Terrified Jews began fleeing the German Reich. Kristallnacht was the clearest indication yet

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:26.360
that Jews were no longer safe in Germany or Austria. Soon Jews in Czechoslovakia were also

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:33.400
under threat. The Munich Agreement in September 1938 had handed the Sudetenland in the northwest

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:40.120
of the country over to Germany. In March 1939 the Wehrmacht marched into Prague.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.120
The Nazis now controlled the whole of Czechoslovakia.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.120
Des Goulton.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:56.360
Few days later the Germans actually marched in and I could see the columns of the Germans

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:06.760
marching into Prague and there was where we are living a boarding on a wall and there were various

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:19.080
posters placed there and the Germans used to use it to write posters and I remember that they

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:29.160
used the Czech language but it was particularly badly written so I think they went out of the way

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:38.600
to humiliate the Czech people by writing Czech notices in a bad language because there was no

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:45.720
shortage of people who could have written it in a perfect Czech. Less than six months after the

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:53.080
invasion of Prague, Europe was in flames. Once the Second World War began, escape from the German

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:59.960
Reich became almost impossible. Jewish communities were trapped with little hope of rescue.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:07.240
The voices you have heard in this episode were able to flee to Britain and to Wales before this

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:15.800
happened. In the next episode we discover how these refugees managed to get out of Nazi-occupied

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.360
Europe and what their journey was like.
