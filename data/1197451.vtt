Friends Alex and Aled share how they stay in touch with their friends and each other.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:14.160
Oh, I use social media like Facebook, MSN messenger, still got that going somehow.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.960
Don't know how I've managed to keep that up and running. I do send emails to a few of them as well

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.720
because I got friends over in the state. Yeah, that's a good way to kind of...

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.280
It's easier than that. It was a way of FaceTime isn't it? Yeah. A version sort of.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.760
There is, but we used to just write emails up, we used to write songs out to an email and all

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.120
and just send them back and forth. That's what I loved about MSN because it was very real time.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.760
Yeah. And it was quick and reliable. You know, because I actually remember using it as well.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.240
And because I remember we used it one evening when I was home and you were home and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.080
we were on the games console together, the Xbox. Xbox 360. Yeah. Yeah. And we thought right,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.280
instead of just viewing each other through the headset, let's just do the video call. Yeah.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.280
Yeah, that was another way we stay in touch, just either FaceTime. My friend is probably similar

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.640
to Alex, is either probably Facebook, not Twitter because we got hardly anyone on Twitter.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.680
Well, either games console. Well, I think that's it. Phone and text and console.
