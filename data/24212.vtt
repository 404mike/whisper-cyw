00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Kenfig Pools

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We shall tramp about, with our eyes on small traps of water in the track.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
His eyes will be mine, even the styes that crowd the lid,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and the black lines like wax seals when he squints.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They will be my seeing through, and as we hike together,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
loud hints then silence, flicking early dew upon our shins.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
His stride motions my stumble with a kick,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
a mime for stubborn child, an autism of shapes,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
a quick conversation like a hundred others had before,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
this time about our boots and how we both wanted brothers.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We spot a pair of busy coots, tentative and hungry on a flooded mire,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
pecking anything that moves in their little square.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Eyes of fire when we stamp through.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
They lose the beat they both had on a water boatman.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Call us clumsy fools and flee to the place they once caught a young perch,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
those Kenfig Pools,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
where freshwater sinews meet the muscular Bristol bore.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We sigh like butterfly nets and continue,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
a shared satisfaction in a circular walk.
