00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In 1919, one of the major issues was the world climate, the global environment.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
At a local level, you wouldn't have seen that in the UK and in Wales during the race riots,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but it was very important to the politicians.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now the race riots were a shameful part of that year,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and when revolution across Europe seemed possible to the politicians, they were afraid.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And you understand the way they acted, you've got to understand what happened in 1919 across the UK.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And then maybe we can grasp why it seems black and minority people were used to ease tensions.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Straight fact is the fear was communism and the fear was revolution.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Most people believed that the war simply ended, but that was not true.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Because in December 1917, during the Bolshevik uprising, when the Red Army of Lenin, etc. were removing the monarchy in Russia,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:22.000
France, Italy and Britain signed an agreement to help the White Army, the monarchy army, fight against the Red Army.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Churchill in particular felt very, very angry at underestimating it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He was a part of a ruling class that was removed in Russia.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He was part of the British equivalent.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now he wanted to slow down demobilization, not remove conscription, so that Britain could go to war in Russia.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The problem is the troops were tired. They'd signed up to fight Germany, not to carry on fighting forever.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So David Lord George, the Prime Minister and his Minister of War decided the answer was to stop any revolution in Britain.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And they were afraid there would be one.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And it must be understood if people read Simon Webb's book on 1919, they realize we came very, very close to a revolution.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So this is a simple timeline. There will be things that are missing on it.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
To understand why the race riots were easy to happen and the state of mind of the white mob,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
you need to understand the riot strikes, uprisings and racial violence that occurred as part of that year.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000
In January 1919, on the 3rd of January in Folkestone, thousands of soldiers blockaded the harbour and marched on the town hall.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
When they heard a rumour saying they were being sent back to France.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The same happened in Dover. And in Dover they formed a soldiers' union.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Well that's mutiny. On the 7th in January, barely reported, 7,000 soldiers marched from Shoreham to Brighton Town Hall demanding demobilization.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
On the 9th, 1,500 soldiers marched on Downing Street to confront Lloyd George.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
He did not meet them, one of his brigadiers did.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:28.000
On the 13th in Milford Haven, there was a mutiny aboard the HMS Kilbride and the Navy ensign was taken down and replaced by the red flag.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
15th of January in Southampton, 20,000 soldiers went on strike.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And that had to be broken up after about six days by bringing in a brigadier.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And on the 21st, not a soldier strike, but much more serious in a lot of ways in Dublin.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Sinn Fein, after getting MPs elected in the 2018 general election, said they would not go to parliament to take up their seats and they declared an independent island in Dublin.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
23rd, Glasgow Harbour riot.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
26th, Calais. The British army in Calais, there was a mutiny.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The men wanted to come home. They were told they weren't going to, or at least that's what they heard.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So men from the Val de L'Eve camp and the Vendrew camp actually mutinied.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And they were supported by the women of the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
On the 27th, trade union action started.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And in Glasgow, trade unions called a general strike.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Similarly in Belfast, the trade unions called a general strike.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
On the 30th, back in France, in Calais, the army suppressed the mutiny.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
But they were afraid of reprisals and not one person was charged with riot or mutiny.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And on the 31st, in Glasgow, the Battle of George Square, Churchill sent tanks in to break up the strike, which was for a 40-hour week.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Then in February and April.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000
On the 3rd of February, in Lincoln, the Sinn Fein leader, Aamon de Valera, was removed.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
He escaped from Lincoln prison.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
On the 4th, the race riot started in South Shields.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And on that same day, 4th and 5th, in North Wales, the Canadian soldiers based at Kenmore Army Camp rioted.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
They demanded to be repatriated back home.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000
78 were arrested, 25 sent to prison, 3 of the rioters and 2 guards were killed.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
On the 11th of March, in London, was the Battle of Bow Street.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The riot involved an estimated 2,000 Australian, American and Canadian servicemen fighting against 50 Metropolitan police officers.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And on the 12th of March, there was the race riot in Salford, in the Green Gate area.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And on the 15th of March, in Wales, the teachers strike in the Rhondda.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Then 17th of April, Limerick, they declared a Soviet...

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
It's important to understand that the word Soviet actually meant a council.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So effectively in Limerick, they decided Limerick would become a Soviet council led by the people and an independent republic.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
They even printed their own money.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
On the 5th of June, in Liverpool, the race riot started.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
8th of June, in Newport.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
11th of June, in Cardiff and in Barry.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And on the 14th of June, in Stepney, East London, an Arab coffee shop in Cable Street was attacked by the white mob.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And Chinese and Caribbean people were attacked.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
On the 15th of June, Surrey, the Canadian troops rioted in Epsom.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And a police sergeant was killed.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And on the 16th of June, in Poplar in East London, the Chinese were attacked.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And later that day, groups of West Indians.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
July 1919 was no quieter.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Quite the contrary.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
On the 3rd of July, the first coal miner strike.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
That was in Derbyshire, then Yorkshire, and then in Merthyr.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And on the 23rd of July, in Luton, the town hall was burned down by soldiers.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And the statement made by the town clerk says, grievances mentioned were of more serious importance.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.000
More serious, unquote, than their annoyance at a Remembrance Day ceremony they were proposing.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.000
More serious importance, such as alleged unsatisfactory allowances to discharge soldiers and their dependents.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
The 23rd of July, Bilston, near Wolverhampton, rioting by soldiers.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
25th of July, Swindon, rioting by soldiers.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:23.000
25th of July again, in Coventry, and this lasted a few days, soldiers rioting, but general looting.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Moving on to August, and on the 5th, there was a National Baker strike.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Now national strikes were uncommon.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And on the 7th of September, in London, the police went on strike for union recognition.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Same day in Liverpool.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.000
The reaction of the government to that was 3,000 police officers were dismissed nationally.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And they introduced legislation that stopped them striking.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
27th of September, the National Union of Rail Women held a 10-day strike nationally.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.000
30th of September, staff at the Daily Sketch in London refused to print criticism of the railway strikers.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And on the 7th of November, in Cork, soldiers were rioting again.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Two police officers at least were shot over a 10-day period.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Now, the press has always handled these things, and government responded in their own way.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So, some quotes from the period, the Times stated,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.000
We're asked to publish, but have no intention of publishing, a great many letters on the subject of demobilization,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
which show a deplorable lack of responsibility on the part of writers.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Fanning and agitation, which is already mischievous and may become dangerous.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
These demonstrations by soldiers have gone far enough.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Should be mentioned, although this wouldn't affect the right-wing press,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000
There were still restrictions on press reporting. War restrictions were still in place.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Churchill later wrote that in 1919, he strove with all his energy against communism.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Because at that time, I considered communism with its idea of world revolution the greatest danger to the British Empire.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.000
The strikes, riots, mutinies were all seen as being part of a communist uprising.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So, all across Britain in 1919, there were tumultuous events, mutinies, strikes and race riots.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It was a year of revolt. It was also a year when working people and members of the military felt betrayed by their newly elected government.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
That was a government elected on a massive majority.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
We will next look at the global picture.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000
It's important to understand that although not even the press were reporting the picture of the world all over,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Downing Street would have been in touch with all of the world leaders, all of its representatives across the British Empire,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and would have seen a bigger, more frightening picture.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:32.000
A picture that was to lead to such things in the Empire as over 300 people dying in the Punjab as they were massacred at Amritsar.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
This is Jamie Bacon. This is HDA Cardiff.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:47.000
The Racial Riots Project 1919, which is supported by Heritage Lottery in Wales.
