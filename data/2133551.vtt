00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.120
Okay, recording. The day is Thursday the 13th of April. The time is 1438. Mike Nicholson

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.120
interviewing Susan Nicholson for the Mencap Heritage Project. Present also with us are

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:29.360
Charlotte Edmonds and Joanne Nash. Okay, Susan, where would you like to start?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:38.960
Hi, I'm Sue Nicholson. I'm chair of Chepstow Mencap. I've been chair since 2011.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.360
So quite a long time then?

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.360
Yes, 11 years I believe it. No, 12 years this year it will be coming up.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.360
But am I right in saying that your involvement with Chepstow Mencap begun a lot sooner than 2011?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.360
Yes. So I was there at the beginning 50 years ago because my mother, Heather Parrott, is actually the founder of Chepstow Mencap.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:15.360
And we're celebrating our 51st year this year. So I became chair in 2011 and I had the fabulous opportunity

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.360
with my trustee board to look at a building that came up for sale called the Board School.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:32.360
Our building that we were actually in at the time had outgrown the service that we provided.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:42.360
It was a converted pub over three floors and the lift shafts were in the chimneys of that old pub.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.360
And of course from 1998 up to the present day wheelchairs have got that much bigger so it was no longer fit for purpose.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:05.360
People with mobility issues had difficulty getting to all the floors and for personal care we had to go outside the building down a ramp to our changing facilities.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:18.360
So the Board School came up for sale in 2013. The Board came along, had a look at it, we had the funds to purchase it but we didn't have many other funds apart from that.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.360
We felt it was a good buy so we took the chance and the purchase went through in August that year.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.360
In my naivety I thought a few grand, a lick of paint, it will be alright.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.360
And I thought again in my naivety we'd apply for something like the lottery funding and that would be okay.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.360
The reality is it's taken us ten years in the making but in that time we've done loads of fundraising.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:03:02.360
We were given a lottery grant on the second application which was incredible and that gave us half a million pounds which was our starting point.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.360
Wow, so that's quite a lot of money then.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:14.360
It was, the total bill though was 1.4 million and fair play to all the grant holders who gave us the funds.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:28.360
But a big shout out to Chepstow Community because everyone rallied together and everyone contributed to the project which we originally named Vision 2020.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:38.360
But as we all know Covid came along in 2020 which kind of scuppered and delayed the plans.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.360
But actually we got through it and we're now in this building as beautiful as it is.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.360
So you said you were based at the Barclay before coming here to the board school.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360
Yes.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.360
The Barclays are building in Chepstow.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.360
It's in the centre of Chepstow. It was a pub when we bought it.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:11.360
We got planning permission to operate as a day centre and they actually converted and opened in 1998 which is 25 years ago.
