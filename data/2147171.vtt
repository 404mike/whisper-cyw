00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Whatever story you would like to put on paper and have recorded, that's all it is.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So give as much detail as you would like or give as little detail as you like.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's totally up to you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Make it sharp and sweet and...

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I think that first...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Two points.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
First things first.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yes.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I know...

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Is it a set question you're going to ask?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I've got a few set questions but I might flex around them.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Okay.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Do you mind if I just go through all these one by one?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There's things like growing up here, moving here, what's life like being here and just a little bit about age alive.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Okay, coming on then.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So first things first.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Before we always stop and start again.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Could you tell me your name and where you were born?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
My name is Muriel Watson and I was born in Newtown, Bastia St. Kitts.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Muriel, can you remember what St. Kitts was like?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Tell me, give me as much vivid information.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What was it like?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Well, it was home.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It was nice, hot, friendly.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Of course, in 1961 I came to this country so things would be much different now I expect than when I left there.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But everybody was friendly, we were very respectful.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We had to respect the older people.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Couldn't answer back like now.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And it was just right for me.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Do you remember maybe any games you played or how did you have fun?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Well, we made up our own games then.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We'd skip, we'd sing, you know.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Yeah, we'd make our own game, hopscotch, any kind of game.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Did you have any brothers or sisters?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Yes, I had one brother and two sisters, family of four.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What do you remember then?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Well, I was the younger one, the last one.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So, well, you could call it like nowadays, the baby of the family.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Very cared for.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You know, my brother, well, he hoovered around me like over this business.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000
My sisters were kind even when they left St. Kitts before I did and they looked after me.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
They would always send back letters and whatever they had, gifts.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So tell me about when did you arrive in the UK?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I came, pardon me, I left St. Kitts the 15th of November, 1961.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I got here the 30th of November because I came on the SS Monster Act.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Came to Southampton.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I was met by my husband, TB, then.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And we missed the last train to Wales, Newport, so we had to stay overnight in the railway station.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It was cold, very, very cold.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I was glad for the fire.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
For the first time I saw a fire anywhere in the house.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You know, and the sparklers was coming everywhere.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And so we caught the next train to Newport the early morning.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:33.000
They got to Newport on Friday, the 1st of December, 1961.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
What was that journey over? What did it feel like? Were you nervous?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The journey over was very, very nervous.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
But of course, the five of us in the cabin, we were the same in the same situation.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So we made friends, we would sing.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I was the only one in there from St. Kitts until someone in the bottom deck was being sick all the time.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So they were allowed to come up and stay with me.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So there was two of us from St. Kitts in the cabin.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And I'm very, very nervous.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I was scared, actually, of the soldiers.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So we used to make sure the doors were always locked.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And yes, we just survived.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Tell me about your first week.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
On the boat or here?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Here.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
My first week over here.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Well, to be honest, I came here the Friday.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The Saturday we stayed in all day.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The Sunday, my husband took me over the transporter bridge to show me, because he was working there.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So to show me where he was working, so I could go there to see if I could get the job.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I went over there on a Monday.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It was raining.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I got the job.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I started on Tuesday.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I was only here a couple of days and I started work.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
There was nobody but my husband to be.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Then I realized another lady that lived in the same house, because it was nine rooms in one house,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
102 Alexander Road, and the lady down the bottom.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I was up the top, lady on the bottom.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I realized that she worked there as well.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So as I said, I got the job straight away and I started.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I started on Tuesday.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
It was hard.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It was cold.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
It was freezing.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And I didn't like it at all.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It was raining.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
It didn't stop raining.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It rained for days.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So different to send kids.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
You get heavy showers there.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
You get hurricane and all that, but it's so different.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It was so different.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Adopting was hard.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
The only thing was that I knew as the person that I came to, that was my husband to be.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We got married the March.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And that was it.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
You know, at work.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And after a few, it was hard.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I had to wear gloves.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The material you had on too was hot.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I got used to it because I wanted to work, to occupy my time as well.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I had been staying in the one room all the time.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I was able to go.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
My husband to me used to work shift, 6 to 12, to the 10.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So I knew you could see him going through during his break time.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
After a while I got used to the work and I was allowed overtime.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It was 6 pounds 18 and 6 vans a week.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
That would be like 6 pounds 70, 75 pence now.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000
If you do overtime and you do Saturday morning you'll get 9 pounds, 9 pounds and a week.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
That was a lot of money then.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Of course a loaf of bread was only like a shilling, like 25 pence now.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Things were cheap.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
You know, and yeah.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
What do you remember of your childhood?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
What was it like?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
My childhood, my parents, my mother, she worked as well.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
She worked in a crÃ¨che.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
That's like a preschool nursery like for children.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000
My father was a cassandre of, like you call it, welfare person that would go around and make sure people were well being and all.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And then he worked in the district for a while then he was taken.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
He worked other places.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So sometimes we would have, my father would be home all the time.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
He'd be away for a week and so on.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But as I said, my parents, my mother worked.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Do you remember of any cultural or spiritual practices or any sort of practices that you brought over with yourself?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
We were Moravian.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Went to the Moravian Church then.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Every Sunday we went to church.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
We had to go to Sunday school as children.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
We'd go to children's church.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We'd go to junior choir.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
We took part in everything that the church offered.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Always go to church ever since I could remember.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
What's a Moravian Church?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
A Moravian Church is like the Methodist.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
You heard of the Methodist?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
It's like a sister church to the Methodist.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So when I came here, there was no Moravian Church in Newport.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So I went to the Methodist Church.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
After a while, the Methodist Church.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
First of all, I went to the church down pale.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
But there were only black people there, so we didn't go there for long.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And then we found the Methodist Church.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So we went to the Methodist Church then.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And then after that, they outgrew the church.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The people were getting older.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And so they had to move.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So then I joined the New Testament Church then.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
It's a faculty church.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Yeah.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So tell me a bit about living in Newport.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
What was it like for you?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
It was strange, different.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Didn't know anyone, as I said before.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So we worked Monday to Friday, and Saturday sometimes.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And then we go to Cardiff, where there were more people from St. Kitts,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
from the Eastern Caribbean.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Every Saturday after work, we get the train down to Cardiff.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And then there were more people from St. Kitts.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Can you tell me maybe a fond memory you have of growing up,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
or your early days in Newport, and then maybe, yeah,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
maybe an event you went to, or?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Well, as I said, we worked, we worked Monday to Friday.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And then on Saturdays, Sundays, we'd either go to church or have a lie-in,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
catch up on whatever work we had to do in the house and washing and all that, yes.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I could remember coming to Newport, I met one lady.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And of course, living in one room, we had to do laundry outside.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And I could remember her saying to me, playing,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Oh, what are you doing? She says.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
With the laundry that comes every Monday, just put them in a pillowcase,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
two pillowcase or three or whatever, and they'd pick it up and they'd bring it to the next day.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Oh, that was a godsend. Oh, because, you know, it was, then it was so cold, honestly.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
It's cold now, but, gosh. Well.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Well, how did you spend your time socializing?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Socializing, my friends, like, you know, we would meet and we'd play with Calypso music

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and we'd dance, make up our own, you know. We had fun, fun together.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So did you, so Calypso music, that's a very unique music to the east of the Caribbean.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
That's not very Jamaican. No. This is Trinidad and beyond.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Calypso, Calypso, yeah. So tell me about your love of Calypso.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I do because it's just people that would make up songs on anything, anybody, you know,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and it would make sense. So when you dance into it, you really dance into what you know, like, you know. Yes.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Is there special bands that you remember that you like?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Well, the band that, yes, oh yes. They're called the steel band music.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
They're made of the steel band music, not far from where I live.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
My brother and his friends and others, my uncle, you know, do the steel band.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You know, the steel drum, they call it now, but steel band we call it because they make up these from the old cans.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
They'll cut it and they'll shape it and they'll make the cans to music.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I like that. I like that. Even though sometimes if I hear, oh, that's steel band, like, you know,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
they're not in hell and all those places, you know, you don't play the carnival at one time.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
They used to have the steel drum band on there. You know, yeah.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Can you tell me a bit about, so did you, they have children?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Five children.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Can you tell me about them being raised here a bit then?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Well, my children. I had two children in the West Indies and as I said, I worked and overtime and all.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And I, 1966, 1966, I think I brought my two girls over. I went to the airport. I brought my two girls over.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Yeah, that was good. Then I started having children here myself.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I had Vasily was born here and Val and Sean, Sean, you know, Sean Wharton, he was born here.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.000
That's my son. My two sons and my one girl born here and the other two girls were born back in the West Indies.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Thank God, all five of them have done really well and I'm grateful.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Thank you very much. I will try one for the UK.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:49.000
We're flying through these questions, which is good.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Can you tell me about when you found Age Alive? How was that like and how has that been for you?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000
The reason I found Age Alive is we had a shalom group in our church and we were lacking of funding.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000
We couldn't get funding and someone of the ladies from Age Alive introduced me to the Age Alive group.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And Roy, you know, to get more funding, I expect he joined us with his group.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:27.000
That's how I came to Age Alive because they got funding for us, the shalom fitness group.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
How's it been for you?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Good. Actually, I did when I went there first, Vanessa was there and I knew Vanessa from, you know, we came to the same town.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
She's from Trinidad? Where she from?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
No, she's from St. Lucia.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
St. Lucia, that's all I say.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000
We're from St. Lucia and we're from St. Peter and of course we had children, we're having children like, and we get to know each other.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Her children went to the same school as my children, Baineswell.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And we just, we live not far from each other then.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I came, I was living down Pail, at least we all came to Pail when we first came.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
I was down in Alexander Road, top floor.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And Vanessa was with us with her aunts.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And we moved to Baineswell when it started.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
After it started having the children, naturally the one room wasn't enough.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So of course the council gave us accommodation.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I had a four bedroom house up in Baineswell and Vanessa had like a three bedroom.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Not far from Victoria Street, Victoria Avenue I think.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And so then we got to know each other more.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Because we used to go, she used to go, we used to go to Cardiff as well on a Saturday.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Sometimes myself, Vanessa, and my other friend that passed, Gloria, we'd get the train and we'd go to Cardiff if our husbands were working.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And that's how I, you know, I was happy when I joined AGI Life because I knew someone there.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Apart from my Asian friends that I've met and get to know a lot now.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And Vanessa was there. So that was good.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
That was good, I like that.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And with AGI Life, what made me stay there as well was the motto I liked,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
respect for all. I think it's just respect now but then it was respect for all.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And I like that because you respect me, I respect you, regardless of your religion, creed or colour.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:43.000
If you had to try and explain AGI Life to a 49-year-old or something, how would you try and explain it?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Oh come, come and join us. First of all you're free to come and go when you like.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:57.000
There's no restrictions, no limits, no boundaries. You join in, you take part and there's something every week.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I mean we got mindfulness, we had Tai Chi, we had the singing, we had creative writing, trips,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
places that I've been I don't think I would have ever gone.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Oh there's something all the time, all the time, you know.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Yes and as I said, if anything, we're human beings, anything we just say.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I go shallow and I just sit.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I mean it sounds like you've had quite good experience.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Yes, AGI Life is great, it's a great place to go.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
People will find fault regardless of what you do, you cannot please everybody.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
But Roy does his utmost to make sure things are put into place.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So then my final question really is going to be about the nature of this stuff, it's archived, it can last for up to 100 years.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Yes.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Would you like to leave a message for anyone or people or society or human beings or maybe the big robots, we don't know.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Be kind, be happy, you know, just love life and join as much group as you can because there are places there that you can go to if you need help.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And to socialize, there's many, many things you can do, places you can go and you can take part in.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Just be happy, live your life.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
That's the myriad of things.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Be happy and be kind to each other and to yourself of course, number one.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Love yourself.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
That's the philosophy.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Yes, love yourself.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:59.000
A lot of people go through hard times and sometimes I sit back and I said, oh my goodness, I could understand clearly where your thoughts could play tricks on you.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Anxiety, we draw anxiety.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
So you've got to bring your mind back.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Our mindfulness lady tells us, just bring your thoughts back to the present.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Be thankful for.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Have a gratitude manual.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Thank you very much.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
I think that's lovely, lovely, very positive interview.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Well, I was wondering, you know, I said, oh, they got it there already.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I said, I'm not doing it anymore.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I said, they've got it there.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
You know, I don't want to be Donald.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Yeah, I took that one all day, you know, years ago back a yard.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And then.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
That's happy.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
I'm happy to do it.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
I think I think you did mention it.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So maybe this will be merged with that one just to extend it and just to give an update maybe.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah, sure.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Yeah.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
But yeah, thank you for your time.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Thank you too for having me.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Hopefully you don't you can still get to Tesco and your son and.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Is now today or you got some.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
I think we're here.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Listen, there's one more coming at three o'clock.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So I've got a little while.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
I'm trying to sort out a camera and my paper.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
No, no, it is a good.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
She can talk for today and tomorrow.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Yeah, a little bit time.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Yeah, it's only 22 now.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Well, thank you very much.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Thank you for the time.
