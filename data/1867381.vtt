00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
It's Tuesday the 30th of October 2018 and I am Nigel May standing in for Stephanie Cruz,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.960
Cultural Heritage Officer for the Elan Valley Project.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.560
With me today are Tim Hipkis, Mike Leitcham and Don Emerich.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.560
That's correct.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.560
I pronounced that correctly.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.300
A group of friends who are walking the Elan Valley Way and Sections.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.680
Thank you for talking to me today.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.180
Don, if I can start with you, I know you and your friends have been walking together now

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.460
for many years and have done over 200 walks across England and the Welsh Marches.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.500
What made you choose the Elan Valley Way and when did you start doing it?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.380
When did we start doing it?

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.380
May this year.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.500
May this year.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.860
Like you said, we'd done quite a lot of walks and we were doing a St Canelm's Way and on

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.900
that way we saw some pipe work being laid, the pipe works being laid and we took an interest

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.380
mostly because they're made in Spain and I have experience of living in Spain so I caught

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:12.180
our eye and took some nice photographs and then Tim did some research and found out about

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.420
the Elan Way and has organised the walk and off we go.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.420
Right.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.420
Thanks Don.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.800
Whilst the Elan Valley doesn't follow the exact route of the pipeline from Elan Valley

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.580
to Franklin and Birmingham, Mike, what are your thoughts on this massive piece of Victorian

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.580
engineering?

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.700
I was just amazed to find out the detail about it.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.020
We actually had a walk which took in the pipes crossing the Ledwich Brook just east of Ludlow

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.460
which was in our local paper and we went and did that a couple of years ago I think and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.100
the detail was given in that article.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.300
It was just amazing the fact that it's all done by gravity which I never realised.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.940
I thought all those little houses you could see were pump houses but the fact that it's

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.940
all gravity and that it was all done what, 130, 110, 120 years ago wasn't it?

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.340
There was a lot of experience then.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.860
They dug canals, Manchester and Liverpool had had water from the Lake District and Lake

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.380
Wrenwey and so on so there was a lot of experience but it was still I think a brilliant undertaking

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.460
that the water can fall at the rate of, well across your living room, sixteenth of an inch

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.420
and do that for 73 miles or whatever.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.060
I think it's absolutely staggering.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.460
I visited the Elan Valley and the lakes and so on many times with the kids and the grandkids

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.740
but never appreciated the scale of it until I read those sort of details and then we saw

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.420
the pipes and it's been great.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.220
Ever since we've enjoyed it.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.580
Thanks Mike.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.780
And finally Tim, I know you used to be a geography teacher.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.420
Is there any elements that stand out for you particularly in terms of social geography

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.420
of the pipeline?

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.500
Yeah, I've done a script here and I think it's best if I go through them and then you

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.860
can use it however you want.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.300
I said my interest was provoked like Mike and Don when we crossed the new pipeline route

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.340
on several occasions throughout our last walk.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.140
I contacted 7 Trent to find out what it was all about.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.180
I had a very helpful document download which explained that the new pipeline was being

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.220
constructed to enable work to be done on the existing pipeline as and when needed.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.180
If the pipeline was closed this new section called the Birmingham Resilience Project would

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.100
be used to keep water flowing to Birmingham.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.260
The 26K pipeline runs from Lickhill on the River Severn between Budely and Stourport

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.180
to Frankley Reservoir.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.060
I then contacted a friend who I'd recorded asking me to walk with him on the Elam Valley

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.980
Way near my home.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.420
I was then able to secure an out of print copy of the book and put the idea to the others.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.100
Geographically these are the points that have interested me.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.860
What was the reason for the dams and aqueduct?

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.620
The area selected to meet a need for fresh water was based on sound theoretical geography

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.540
i.e. there was high rainfall in the area, on average 70mm per annum.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.820
The narrow valleys were ideal for building dams.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.940
The bedrock of the area was impermeable, ideal for retaining water.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.460
And the two valleys were higher than Birmingham, thus gravity would facilitate the flow to

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.020
Birmingham avoiding the need for pumps.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.780
Second point, the effect on the population of the valleys was negative but positive for

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.820
the growing population of Birmingham.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.620
In Elan 18 cottages, a church, a chapel, a school and two residences were destroyed.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.420
The effects of, the third point, the effects of major construction project not just in

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.580
Elan but along the route.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.100
The influx of navvies on the social make-up of the various settlements.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.660
Increasing demand in Birmingham led to the construction of a second reservoir, Barclay,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.500
which is now a provider of open space and water activities.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.780
That was in the 1930s I think.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.780
Industry and nature along the route is the fifth point.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.460
The geology of the iron, coal and limestone deposits along the route around Coockley,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.860
on the Clees, around Lentwood Island and so on.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.180
Sixth point, the nature and wildlife on the two Birmingham reservoirs and at Trimpley

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.260
and the stunning scenery, the woods, the vistas, the route through the wire forest.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.820
Seven on the Clee Hills, there was the history of it, the scattered settlements and evidence

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.060
of pipeline valve chambers were appearing and the interesting human population I think

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.780
is the expression interesting in quotation marks.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.300
The eighth, the area south of Ludlow, the vision of the three pipes crossing at Ledwich

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.780
and the Canem Iron Age Camp nearby.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.500
The ninth point, Lentwood Island itself is a Roman site and the influence of the Marcher

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.700
Lords, the boundary between England and Wales, why was it there and so on.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.140
Tenth point, the wildlife and land use on the approach to Knighton and the hills of

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.340
the marchers has been fascinating.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.140
The eleventh point, the warring factions, Owain, Glendua, the Mortimer's, the English Civil

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.620
War, whilst that's a matter of history, why here, why in this region?

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.540
And finally, Offers Dyke, which we're going to walk today, why is it there, how was it

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.060
built and what's its route?

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.700
Those are my points that I would use as a geography teacher that I could see an awful

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.660
lot of work done with my colleagues in history and biology and so on.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.380
Thanks Tim, that was very very thorough and thank you for that.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:53.140
In conclusion, are there any other points that you'd like to say about the valley and

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.140
the pipeline?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.140
It's the countryside.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.860
I would just add to that, yeah.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.940
I think also the contrast from beginning in Birmingham and realising that all this pipe

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.620
work is bringing water and you just take it for granted, water's so much tame for granted.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.060
And then walking through fabulous countryside, absolutely wonderful.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.140
And we've met some nice people along the way.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.140
Cumberlanding agree.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.420
Well, thank you very much for your time, it's very very much appreciated and good luck with

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.900
the rest of the walk and hope you have an enjoyable time.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.900
Thank you.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.400
Thank you.
