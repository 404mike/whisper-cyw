00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.000
See a griddle, see a griddle, You can't get by your rules.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The lady down the pond, Who's the bird in the box, Who's this the boy in the box?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Rules, rules, rules.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Rules and rules, rules and rules, In the way I am in.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But don't go beside your guard, When my boy can sing.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Rules, rules, rules and rules, In the way I am in.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Rules, rules, rules and rules, In the way I am in.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Rules, rules, rules.
