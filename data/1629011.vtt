00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.400
He said, you know, he said that just I remember just having a conversation when he came fishing one day and he's

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.640
told they just had a

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.940
sighting of Threshers up by Bardsie.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.200
So that was in the 80s. So they've probably been around forever, you know.
