00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When the soldiers arrived and was billeted in both, Mrs. Whitechott, I don't know why,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.180
I suppose kindness of heart, decided to open the cafe during the evening and these boys

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:21.600
came in and there was a piano there and of course, you know, don't take long for there

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.000
to be a sing-song when somebody can play the piano and then two or three of the lads met

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.120
local girls so they used to come in as a couple and gradually sort of got to know more people

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.480
like that but it was, I didn't really get to know any of them personally, I was only

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.040
young, I was younger than most of the girls and that about and I used to sort of be picked

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.520
up and taken home, we used to have to walk up the hill then, there was no transport and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.640
I don't know whether or not you've ever walked up that hill but it used to be a dark, very

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.120
old, never thought anything of it in those days, you used to walk up the hill if you

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.080
met anybody in the darkness you'd say good night to them as you passed and no idea who

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:20.120
it was. The cafe, well West End stores, where you go around now to the new hall? It was

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.280
only occasional, just coming down in the evening and we were busy then, I mean making sandwiches

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.640
and serving tea and coffee and I mean talking to them of course and joining in the sing-song

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:43.720
but I can't say that I really got involved at all so and I don't know that the village changed

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.680
that much I suppose it did but everything was very hush hush and no one was allowed

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.680
down the bottom down to a slus there so I mean whatever was carrying on down there.
