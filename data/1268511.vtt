00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It sometimes comes into my head That we may dream, we dream when we are dead.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That I and our world should be true.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:57.000
All that we must know, all that we must know,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That my rest would be, would be dead among the flesh.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I should forever dream.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:02:03.000
All that we must know.
