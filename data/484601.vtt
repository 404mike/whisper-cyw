00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
Cardiff Carnival 25th Anniversary Project, interviewer Steve Fletcher, interviewees Paul

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.900
and Nicky Keeping, venue Swicker Office, date Friday the 14th of November 2015.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.060
So Paul and Nicky, when did you first come across Swicker or its predecessor Theatre

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.060
Talleus in Wales?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:35.220
Well we first met Mr Swicker about 10 years before Swicker in 1985 when you really were

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.900
the first person to befriend us when we moved to Cardiff, Steve Fletcher.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.980
How did we meet him?

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.900
We just met in chapter, around chapter.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.380
I think he's so nosy he came over and wanted to talk to us didn't he?

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.100
He said who are you, where are you, where have you come from, what are you doing?

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.780
And I think we were just drinking at that stage.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.660
We might have got into a bit of happy hour drinking after that with Steve and yeah we

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.500
became great friends.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.740
But then I suppose we saw Steve working with initially Cardiff Laboratory Theatre and then

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.260
the Centre for Performance Research and then he went off to London for a while to Chisholm

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.820
and came back and started working with Theatre Talleus in Wales.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.580
We loved the Mad Dog and Tumshan Khatti and we got to know the Bavaiars of Gujarat and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.060
generally had a great time.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.460
And then of course I was working for Cardiff Council so really that first mass, although

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.220
I wasn't part of it, I saw it going through Cardiff Castle and that was really excellent.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.180
But then after a little while there was one New Year's Day when we'd woken up with a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.460
hangover probably and we'd had a little bit of a tiff.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.460
Had we?

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.460
Yes.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.620
And you came round Steve and said oh have you heard there's an induction course for

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.540
this Cardiff Samba Band which then was still relatively new and that was probably in about

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.180
1993 or something.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.060
We tossed a coin because we weren't in a position to really rationally agree who was going to

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.900
go because we had two young kids and only one of us could go.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900
So we flipped a coin and...

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.900
You wouldn't have gone anyway if you'd won.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.620
You'd have gone for a week and said oh hey, I don't want to.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.700
And so Nicky with her sticking power became a big part of the Cardiff Samba Band for about

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.300
20 years.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.340
And actually we still, you know, you still perform with them this summer in France, didn't

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.460
you, on Bastille Day.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.060
But then because we went along to the first, well one of the early Sambadromes down at

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.540
Channel View and Nicky was playing with the Samba Band and for me as someone who always

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:11.060
really sort of felt dreadful in a dancing environment saw all these amazing blokes dancing

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.100
really well like Ian Devereux and Adrian Wiggins looked very fetching in a matching zen outfit.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.780
And I sort of thought well if...

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.140
And I met all these cool Samba people and thought well I've got to learn how to dance

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:36.660
and picked up a flyer for patchoua dance and ended up doing a weekend.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.700
After that weekend I couldn't actually get down the stairs except on my bum because I

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.020
was exercising muscles I'd never used before.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.300
That was ages later than that, probably.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.820
Well it was before my first mass and I think the first mass I did I think was 1994 because

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:01.860
I remember blue was the theme and I was dancing with a life-size puppet whose shoes were tied

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.380
to my shoes and we were doing sort of partner dancing with Fernanda and Nicky was in the

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.740
Samba Band so that was my first mass.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:19.540
I had done a couple before with Daisy and Jimmy when they were tiny and so very young

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.540
they did the carnival right up until they were 15, 16 and every year they did it and

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.140
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.140
Yeah so I was a bit earlier and that was great fun.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.100
And of course they've both gone on to work in that kind of lifestyle.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.100
Daisy's an actor now and Jimmy works in films.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.060
Still very lively both of them.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.060
And I think they both learnt a lot.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.580
They really enjoyed dressing up, they really enjoyed tearing down the road, they loved

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.620
winding up people on the street.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.700
So that for them was their favourite.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:04.460
But they've taken part in some of the juvets, these secret pre-carnival rioting.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.220
They would actually no they didn't because they were too young and I enjoyed myself far

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.180
too much to allow the kids there then because it was all about just smothering yourself

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.920
in paint and having a lot of drinking, getting very loud and tearing through the town which

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.500
I thought was the best part of carnival always.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.060
I think they did the first juvets we did because my brother and his wife were down.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.660
I think they were looking after them and saw us doing it.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.660
No they were part of the juvets.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:44.340
Well if I'm right but that was the year that the juvets was happening in the Hayes.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.220
There was a concert on the bandstand at the Hayes and we were supposed to tie, we were

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.860
in an underground car park or a you know like part of the St David shopping centre and we

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.540
were supposed to wait until a signal.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.100
We come out just as the concert was finishing and you'll remember it Steve, it was an interesting

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:13.940
evening but what happened was we were doing jab jabs and so Tom of Warped and Twisted

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.020
was our was the sort of sectioned leader really.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:26.300
He just went bang bang and then we just whipped into line thinking that was our cue and we

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.620
started marching out of this underground car park and we arrived about ten minutes early.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.140
Sounds like carnival doesn't it?

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.140
Yeah.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.020
They were furious weren't they?

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.140
And obviously we weren't going to stop and there was a bit of a, I wouldn't call it a

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.500
Mexican stand off.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.940
Sound clash at the very least.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.700
Lamar started shouting didn't he between every jab jab he would shout what he was going

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.340
to do to people and jab jab where he's going to do it, jab jab.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.780
The best one was I'm going to use Mike Chubb's head as a football I see.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.980
We all just cheered really loudly.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:08.060
Poor Mike, he just looked crestfallen didn't he?

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.460
Juve was absolutely great.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.300
It was the spirit yeah which I really loved that it was just like let's just go for it.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.220
They were dark carnivals compared to the carnivals there are now but I think I felt that they

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:28.980
came from a punk era very much and we were all of the same mind and for me I felt very

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.060
comfortable in that kind of thing.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.540
They were far more libertarian in that sense do you think?

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.980
Well they didn't follow a norm did they?

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:45.260
It wasn't carnival in that sense, it was carnival of people of the city of Cardiff and all the

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.140
all their pasts all together it's not like right we're going to have a nice red section

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.220
we're going to have a nice blue section and this is going to be you know represent the

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.260
sea it was a lot of individualism and it was just like what do you want to be what should

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.420
we do and you just decided it was very free.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.460
I mean you had a Mark as Paulie was talking about early on you know with the tan there

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:13.980
was two rooms so you had two different sections of carnival really as well so you had a Maru

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.700
section which was a lot more traditional.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.060
There was a lot more sewing going on.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.900
A lot more sewing yeah and then of course in the other section it was just spray paint

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:29.580
which was just so toxic in there people on one side would moan constantly because they

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.700
were smoking fags and and spraying really stinky paint everywhere.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:42.860
It was plastic and yeah burning of plastic, ripping of gaffer tape and it was just was

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.220
really quite creative.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:51.140
It was creative but very dark and I think probably well I just love that's what I love.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.380
I think you have a punk ethic as you were saying.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.380
It really did.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:09:01.540
It was our era wasn't it and I suppose it was stuff we'd never really done or I'd never

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.540
really done before.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.620
No no we were able to do it weren't you.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:10.980
Meeting great people that we'd never met before and they're still really close friends now

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:16.660
People like Mareaga we met then, Gareth we met through the mass, we met Tom and Ali,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:23.340
we met Spike you know all those people Ben, Jude and Shona all those people we met through

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.340
the mass.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.940
But also on the other side was Alva and Maru.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.980
And Sally and Adrian was always in an interesting position because he had his Powys sort of

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:40.220
connection and Adrian liked, you obviously had Simon you know with the Cardiff Samba

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.140
band and Adrian had his small carnival troupe.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.460
Nice bit of rivalry there.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:55.500
Plus you know Bristol coming over, bristling of you know strutting of leaders who can lead

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.500
the best.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:02.380
And then Swansea always really great with their Celtic sort of West Walyan thing.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.820
Yeah no it's all good.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:12.460
And of course 1995 as it is was the Well of Wisdom which was an early attempt to not mainly

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:18.140
have a parade but to put on a presentation that tried to move towards carnival theatre

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.100
or told a story and certainly in those early days and you already mentioned ending up in

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:29.100
the Hayes on one occasion there was a whole period where the final carnival presentation

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.100
happened on the steps of the National Museum.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.100
Tell us about that experience.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:41.100
I mean a fabulous backdrop and it was a nice area wasn't it because people could crowd

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.620
around and then you could perform.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.900
You've got a great performance space area there and it's huge.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.620
Good sight lines.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.620
So you've got loads of people can see it.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.540
It's quite flattering as a performer because you are up quite high.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.740
And yeah you're up high you could move up and down the steps.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.140
There were some great fireworks going on.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:06.300
Oh really nice and the kids again really enjoying that except for when Jim decided he needed a wee

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.500
and he went I said just go behind that pillar Jim it's fine you know in the middle of the show

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:21.820
and so he starts having a wee and suddenly the the rain you know fireworks started firing down on

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:29.820
him and yeah it was tricky for him bless him he was caught it was a bit traumatic yeah but

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.300
it's just such a great there was no burning involved was there oh it was just a bounce here

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:40.700
and there a bounce of a spark it was enough to eat yeah did worry he worried it he was only about

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:46.380
four at the time he worried him slightly but hey he came back the next year he wasn't you know put

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:53.900
off but though a really nice and also finishing in the night yes really good yes really great

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:58.940
because in the daytime it's lovely but it was such an atmosphere it was a great atmosphere and it

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:04.300
looked like there was a show happening yeah and there was a bit of a celeb thing going on for a

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:10.380
while with Benjamin Zephaniah did you get to work with him or well yeah we you were a chanter

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:15.580
were you a chanter I think I might have was like yeah yes I was a chanter terrible memory

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:21.420
I know I remember working and singing the songs with Benjamin I really enjoyed that a lot that

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.380
was nice because it wasn't anything to do with the band or you know it was just doing something

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.980
for myself and it was really good that was the first time ever we decided we needed to get the

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.100
spoken son or chanted word into it yeah Marianne was always very good you know I know we always

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.260
had songs I suppose you're right yeah it was a chance to try and move that was more of a narrative

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:44.700
wasn't it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and one of the key players in that piece of theatre was

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.940
played by yourself Paul oh dear would you get to know us about your character well I was taking

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:55.980
a little sabbatical from work and uh which was great really good and you kindly offered me the

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:02.860
the chance of a a character part uh one that didn't actually involve too much technical dancing so I

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.660
was quite pleased with that and it was quite a dark character uh I think it was called the tempter

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:15.100
or the book man and uh it also involved growing a diabolical goatee beard which flattered me a bit

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:21.420
um yeah so I was there with uh the scales of uh of justice and the book of judgment

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:29.660
massive great horns and nice devil wings that had been made for me and uh I think I was I was trying

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:34.380
to tempt and nowadays perhaps you might be particularly politically incorrect but I was

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:41.580
supposed to be tempting the young people into uh into uh evil ways but all in the best possible

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:49.100
taste yes I assured you know that was great because it gave me the chance rather than I mean

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:55.340
the dancing and and learning the drumming patterns and that kind of stuff is great but developing a

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.820
character and just thinking about what am I going to be what are we going to be like I'm just hearing

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.220
you through the PA annunciating those words and there has to be an audience of three four five

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.380
thousand people watching it I mean and the communication they you know you were great they

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:13.020
understood every word there was there was conveyed meaning going on you know I mean parading is great

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.820
and will always be the backbone of what a carnival does but it's good to explore other things no

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:25.020
definitely I mean one epic moment for me is uh everyone in Cardiff know associated with carnival

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:31.340
or cardiff people will know ninja and uh I can't remember which year it was but I think it might

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:38.780
have been like the the year after that in about 97 or something where um uh Tom I think it was

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:46.220
developed this idea of run de mental which was basically um it wasn't it was sorry it was Chris's

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:52.220
idea he saw it in in in brazil and brought it back it was Chris's idea yeah so the idea was to

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:59.420
create a section that didn't necessarily follow the route of the carnival um and so you would

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:06.780
form a little tableau and drum like mental and then run like mental and there wouldn't be any

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:11.740
plan as to where you were going to run it was just uh I think I can't remember perhaps it was Chris

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:18.060
who's just Chris led it Chris led it you just hair off and the uh this poor stewards from the council

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:25.260
I think you know they've been a small posse assembled to mind our section but we were very

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:30.700
well behaved I think and that's the year that I think gareth met Mareaga so quite a famous year

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:35.580
in that respect um you were taking photos weren't you you weren't actually in it yeah I was doing

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:42.300
first aid as well they were a couple of injuries and uh um they were body painters weren't they

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:48.140
black and white we had lovely black and white body paint we had trained for weeks to do run

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:54.300
de mental if you're thinking about a whole gang of smoking drinking did you want to try and get

00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:04.460
oh my god we had fish came over he was our trainer we had to meet three months beforehand

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:09.500
every Wednesday night Chris got us in and said right if we're going to do this we're actually

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:15.180
going to bloody do it and it means you've all got to learn how to run I'd never run in my life

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:21.820
so Mareaga and and fish down at the tan center every Wednesday or whatever it was

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:30.540
running around the bloody car park doing press-ups doing sit-ups we'd never done anything like that

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:38.540
always having a fag in between you know but it we really worked really bloody hard and I

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:44.460
this is the fittest I tell you it's the fittest I have ever been we bought special drums they were

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:51.260
flown over weren't they from Brazil I think really light wooden drums skin drums and we have beaters

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:59.260
and it and Chris did about three or four different rhythms and we had to train throwing

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:07.900
their running as playing and throwing drums all at the same time which for all of us the first day

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.180
yeah and there was quite a bit of face paint malfunction as well as people getting

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:19.340
face paint in their eyes and stuff like that but it ended up on the steps of the museum and like

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.940
as Nikki said I actually thought I was in the section but now I remember that I wasn't and

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.700
that's the funny thing about mass because sometimes you think you're doing something and

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.580
people say no you weren't actually you didn't think you were doing anything and people said no I saw

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:38.540
you I've got 25 years of that man yeah but they're just an epic moment for me because I also had a

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:46.220
video camera and it was back in 97 so it's a fairly rudimental run to mental camera

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:54.220
but Ninja who is the first time I'd ever really met him and I'd got to know him a bit

00:17:54.220 --> 00:18:02.220
through the Cardiff festival and stuff like that but he just he got on the stage and he launched

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:10.540
into this freeform unrehearsed poetry about Ninja Pendragon and yeah yeah it was just a great moment

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:15.260
for me that yes just so funny and Tom invited him out of the audience to rap because he saw

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.420
him in the audience and he just came forward and off he went and we all performed around him

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:26.380
spontaneity the whole thing and it's all based on sort of friendship and

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.780
Cardiff's a great place and you'll remember the the Cardiff festival in those days there was some

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:37.820
stuff that brought a lot of people together like Hayes Alive and the Children's Festival and those

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:43.180
kind of stuff and yeah it's a nice meeting of minds really sounds wonderful

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.500
just for posterity if future generations listen to you

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.180
how do you sum up the value of the whole experience why was it worth doing

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:05.420
what was it all about why are we here I think it's a wonderful way for people to make a lot

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:11.820
of good friends really great friends I think it's a wonderful way for people who've never done

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:20.940
any kind of you know performing to start off small and amazingly after 10 years are probably

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:27.100
leading a whole section because people you know it's it's infectious it's easy and it's fun

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:34.940
I think it was a very inclusive place as well and I mean I still I haven't really seen a lot of Keith

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:40.380
since stopping doing the mass I mean I still see him around occasionally but he was a dear friend

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:49.020
who you think of someone like him I doubt he as a deaf gentleman I don't think originally homeless

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:56.060
and yeah problem and special needs which indirectly we helped to impact on and yet he became a real

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.860
integral part yeah almost not like a mascot but you know he was just a guy that you expected to

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:10.060
be at the mass and he was able to really express his creative side provided he was allowed to be

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:20.060
a large lady in high heel shoes with a 22 out of 25 smear of red lipstick

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:30.540
you think of people like who are the two girls that turned up with no clothes on at all

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:38.940
totally bare breath they did they basically shoved some snakes tongue in their mouth

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:45.660
appears as serpents I love yeah it was only until the brain occurred to us that they'd done the

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:51.500
whole thing bare-breasted yeah I was just you know fine pushing the envelope wasn't it I think they

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.980
were building up to it for a couple of years they had done they had done it a few years but yeah

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:02.460
this is that was the first time you saw them well because they were sprayed gold they sort of got

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.900
away with it you had to get quite close but I remember them catching up to a policeman who

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.940
as it was happening he suddenly realized that they weren't wearing anything

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:15.500
I love the belly button either you know it's just very unusual and I mean another thing in terms of

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:22.540
professional development you know you think of someone like Caroline who is always a keen dancer

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:31.340
and you know very interested in performance but from her kids doing you know circus school

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:37.100
and that sort of stuff she got into it herself studied learning to do the the I don't know what

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:45.260
it's called the metal stair yeah and then becoming I mean she was really the face of the mass for so

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.220
many years wouldn't she they always the echo always managed to find a picture she's got a lovely face

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.900
but you know now professional carnival artists

00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.060
but they're you know I mean and there were people like obviously Maryann who were

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:05.500
professional performers in their own right but a lot of people as Nicky said got their first chance

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:12.060
to do something without perhaps thinking I am an artist but after a few years they're recognized as

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.780
as leaders in their field so you'll see Caroline at you know festivals all over the UK

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.100
Richard Hugh Morgan who's now in the experimental group we've got back up

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:25.660
yeah through the Breathe Golf experience which has made that his first time he'd ever performed in his

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:31.100
life was in the precursor to Swicko in Theaters of Tally Esse in Wales' Maddox Community Play

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.780
the first time he ever performed and that one thing that's amazing that's strange yeah yeah

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:43.420
on that note Paul and Nicky Keating I wish to thank you for harvesting your memories and to

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.940
declare you not separately but jointly Cardiff Parnell Heroes thank you very much
