Binsey Poplar's by Gerard Manley Hopkins

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.000
My Aspen's dear, whose airy cages quelled, Quelled or quenched in leaves, the leaping sun,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
All felled, felled, are all felled, Of a fresh and following folded rank, not spared, not won,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That dandled, a sandaled shadow, that swam or sank, On meadow and river, and wind-wandering weed-winding bank,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Oh, if we but knew what we'd do when we delve Or hue, hack and rack the growing green,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Since country is so tender to touch, her being so slender,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.000
That, like this sleek and seeing ball but a prick, Will make no eye at all, where we even,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Where we mean to mend her, we end her, when we hue or delve,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Aftercomers cannot guess the beauty being, ten or twelve,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Only ten or twelve strokes of havoc unself, The sweet especial scene.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Rural scene, a rural scene, sweet especial, Rural scene.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Thanks for watching!
