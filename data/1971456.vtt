00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
people were really, really interested in the fact that we had pirates here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We were the last town in Britain to be attacked by pirates.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We've got cannonballs which were fired into the town by pirate ships.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We've got places here where the pirates landed.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So we've got a very interesting sort of history like that.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We also produced our own pirates in the sense that people like Bartholomew Roberts, Black Bart,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
he lived locally, probably went to sea through Fishguard, but he certainly was a local lad,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
very wicked person, but on the other hand, he added colour to the thing because everybody heard of Black Bart the pirate,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
everybody heard of the Jolly Roger, the pirate flag, you know, the skull and crossbones.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Well, he was one of the people who helped to design that.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But Bartholomew Roberts was a pirate chief or he was elected as a pirate chief and he was on the west coast of Africa.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And to frighten people into submission, he designed a flag, which was a black flag.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Up until then, a black flag was always considered a piracy flag.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A pirate would fly a black flag, but he decided to make it look even worse.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
He would put a skull and bones on it.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
French ships who had been captured by Roberts referred to him as the Jolly Rouge, the pretty red man.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
He used to dress in red velvet.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
This is the time of Charles II, very flamboyant sort of dress, you know, sort of feathered hats and so on.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And he used to dress in red velvet and Jolly Rouge got translated into Jolly Roger.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So Jolly Roger's flag was the crossbones.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
He became famous. He made a lot of money out of it and then got killed in 1722.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
He got his head blown off by a cannonball.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So pretty sad. But he was not a very nice character, really.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I mean, he was very eccentric. He did a bit of slave trading.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
He did a bit of all sorts of nasty things.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But we did produce our own pirates who were notorious.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And back in Tudor times, in times of Queen Elizabeth I, this coastline here

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
had a special commission for the suppression of piracy, which was commissioned by the government in London

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
to stop people from being attacked by pirates off the Welsh coast.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
People were very vulnerable here because the coastline here is what they call an unforgiving coast.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
In other words, it's a coastline where you can't just put in, it's too rocky to put in just anywhere.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You have to go into a harbour. And because of that, that meant that pirates could pick off

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
people coming around that coastline.
