00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I've always been handy at making things.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.360
You know, I built dinghies and I used to build my own fishing rods.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.000
When I was small, they bought me the air-fix kits, you know.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.320
I used to build air-fix kits and then I graduated on.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.800
And then suddenly I found when I was retired, because I haven't worked this century, I found

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.080
that I could build ship models that nobody else could.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.560
The beauty of it is, somebody would say to me,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.600
can you build a model of the Kathleen of May?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.880
Yeah, righto.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.560
So the Kathleen of May, you've probably heard of her, haven't you?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.280
She'd sail in and out of Ireland into Pembroke.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.600
And the last voyage into Pembroke was 1960.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.880
She was a sailing ship.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.280
So I built a model of her and I built numerous models.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.440
Perhaps the most famous one I built was the Haiye,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.200
which was a Japanese warship built in Pembroke Dock in 1877.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.600
The Japanese ambassador in 2019 actually came down to see the ship.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.520
And I thought, that's an accolade for a Japanese ambassador to come all the way from London

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.520
just to see that ship.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.840
The most interesting one, which might be going off at a tangent,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.120
was a warship of Henry VII, 1490.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.720
It's an enormous great thing, you know, and you think,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.040
how on earth did that float?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.440
That was one of my last ships.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.360
It's currently in the Pembroke Museum

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.920
because that's where Henry VII was born.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.360
So each of my ships, before I build it,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.480
I have to have an idea of where it's going to go or who wants it.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.000
If I fill the house up with ships,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.040
my wife would say I'm not going to dress that lot.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.560
So anyway, if I build a ship and it goes somewhere else

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.920
and somebody gets pleasure from it, that's what's needed, you know.
