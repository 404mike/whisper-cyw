00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.500
Hello, Paul Robeson. This is Will Painter, President of the South Wales Miners, speaking.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.620
On behalf of the South Wales Miners and all the people gathered at this ice stepward,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.220
I extend to you warm greetings of friendship and respect. We are happy that it has been

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.620
possible for us to arrange that you speak and sing to us today. We would be far happier

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.820
if you were with us in person. Our people deplore the continued refusal of your government

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.540
to return your passport and to deny you the right to join with us in our festival of song.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.820
We shall continue to exert what influence we can to overcome this position. We look

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.660
forward to the day when we shall again shake you by the hand and hear you sing with us

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.300
in these valleys of music and song. As one of our Welsh songs puts it, and we dedicate

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.220
it to you, we'll keep a welcome in the hillsides. We'll keep a welcome in the vales. This land

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.500
of ours will still be singing when you come back again to Wales. And now, Paul, for the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:21.300
procedure for this evening. We would like you to give a message of greetings to the

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.620
Welsh miners and the great audience here assembled in this ice stepward. And after

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.980
that, to sing to us. And after you have sung, we have here on the platform the Triochi Male

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:43.420
Voice Choir, which is one of the premier male voice choirs in Wales. And they will sing

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.100
to you a very beautiful Welsh song, A Dealin Eyre. Over to you, Paul.
