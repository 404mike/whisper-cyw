00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
They say I learned seamanship from my father and he learned it from his father and so on back into antiquity.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Because you know when you have a family settled in one place all the little tales get passed down from father to son.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But coming back to sailing I've always messed about in boats. I became a sailing instructor.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I was sailing instructor for the local Sea Cadet Corps and at the same time I acquired a 1904 vintage itching ferry.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
She was a wreck in a shipyard and I was talking to a lad and he said, oh I'm going to set fire to it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I said don't do that, she's too pretty. Alright you have it. Ah.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So I restored it to sailing condition and oh she was really, she was a classic yacht you know.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The sort of thing you'd be sailing down the haven and a powerboat would come over and all of a sudden you'd find yourself looking down camera lenses

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
because people thought she was worth photographing. I thought wow they've noticed you know.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But it was fun but unfortunately father time caught up with me and I thought now hang on I need to be strong to sail this thing.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And I thought now I'm not as strong as I was and not as nimble as I was so I thought now it would be sensible to let her go.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
She was great fun while I had her you know and she really was a powerful boat.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
To give you an idea she was built in 1904 but she had a huge spread of sails. She had four sails on one mast.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
There was an occasion when I was coming into Milford Haven and a couple of high powered modern yachts were with me and the wind was just right.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And we were tearing along and these modern yachts couldn't pass us.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We were just sort of sitting in the cockpit sort of looking at things and you could hear the crews, hey treat this a bit, push that a bit, move this.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We're not going any faster. Why can't we catch that whole thing?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But I thought that was terrific you know and I thought the old girls got it. But where they would have beat us is going into the wind.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You know she was more difficult to take into the wind and I would have lost her there but with the wind just a little bit behind me nothing could catch her.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That was terrific you know to see all these people in expensive yachts that couldn't catch me.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It was fun at the time you know.
