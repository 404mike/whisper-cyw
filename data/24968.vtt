00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Track five. I don't think I'd picked up anything heavier than a hairbrush.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Not far from here is the nursery. I had a spell in there for a bit after the fire. Not as punishment, you know.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We just had to try our hand at everything before the training ended.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I guess eventually that will all be planted up too, so there'll probably be no sign of it one day.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Goodness knows how many trenches I must have dug for the saplings.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The forestry girls then brought them onto the mountainside to plant.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Violet was just cursing me about having to plant several hundred more acres to replace the trees lost in the fire.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
At least it keeps you in a job, I told her.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
All the time you lumberjills are here, she replied.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It seems funny to think that these little trees will be towering above us in 60, 70 years, all ready to be harvested.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So long as there are no fires, that is.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We've done a bit of felling too, you know.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Before I came here, I don't think I'd picked up anything heavier than a hairbrush.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And there we were, swinging a seven pound axe.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It was only small stuff, but the men were impressed.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I remember waking up that next day, I could barely move.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It must have been a Saturday, a half day, because there was a concert later that night in Machynlleth.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Mind you, it didn't stop us dancing.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We rode our bicycles, you know.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
There was a full moon and the trees were casting all these eerie shadows.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The sound of animals, well, I think they were animals, screeching and scurrying in the woods too.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Even with aching muscles, we found the strength to ride home at breakneck speed.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Speaking of which, we should probably get a move on.
