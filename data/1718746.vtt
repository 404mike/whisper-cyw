00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
Remind me, when did the monks first come to the Abbey?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:13.760
They came in 1176. We seem to have two founding dates, 1143 and 1176,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.160
and it worked like a sort of church planting system,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.840
thinking about church planting today, a successful church goes off and starts

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.560
one somewhere else, and it wasn't very different in

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.440
medieval times with the foundation of the monasteries.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.640
There was a time of religious fervour created by the crusades that were going

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.320
on in the background for quite a while, so 100 years really,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.120
and monks came from Whitland, which is in Carmarthenshire,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.280
to find another abbey.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.280
We think they could not have done that in 1143 because

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.280
they themselves were only founded in 1143, and latest research with Janet Burton

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.320
at Clampeter suggests that they were

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.080
struggling to do that and had to send reinforcements from head

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.480
office as it were, so the chances of them finding an abbey

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.560
here are pretty remote. So 1176

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.280
at the instigation of Cadwachlann, and it developed from there.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.960
There's some suggestion that an earlier abbey was built

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.160
further down the valley just below Devanna,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.600
and that seems to be based on just finding a

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.960
work piece of sculpture there some years ago now, done by the river.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.800
It seems an unlikely sight. They wouldn't have built in stone anyway

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.000
at that point because they tended to build a temporary

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.960
church, and that would have been something very

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.920
timbre built. It took a long time to get abbeys going, about 30 years before

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.120
they were anywhere near up to scratch with it, so they would build the church,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.080
and often they built a small wooden church, and then the bigger church

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.040
they just built basics to start with. Who would have built that? Would the monks have built that?

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.320
There was not enough of them. When an abbey was fully up and running,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.440
you had about 60 monks of one sort or another, either

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.320
full monks or apprentice monks, minor people, and just people who were

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.680
sort of living the life without all the responsibilities of

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.960
religious side of it, but worked out on the farms and the fields and the

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.920
granges, so it was a slow business to develop them.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.480
But there's no evidence that Camille ever had a large complement of

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.520
monks. Whenever there was a snapshot of what was going on there,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.960
which is fairly few, you only got single figure numbers,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.680
so it was never a big monastery in the sense of say fountains or

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.480
Reaver, the big northern ones, or Dastonbury for example.
