00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.200
Roedd yna'n cael ei ddyddio ar y gwaith.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.200
Ac yna, ar y ddiwedd, yna.

Roedd wedi'i gweithio yn y ddwyloedd.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.200

Roeddwn i ddim yn gwneud rhywbeth fel hyn yn y goled.

Felly roedd wedi'i dweud, roedden ni'n mynd i'r Pansepreeth,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.200
ym mhob, pam oeddwch chi'n dechrau i ddod yn y ffactor?

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.200
Mae'r gweithiau ddim yn dda iawn, a ddim yn gallu gael gael gwaith mwy.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:08.200
Roeddwn ni'n mynd i'r 6 o'r awr yn y noed, a'r 1.25 o'r oed i'w llwybr.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.200
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r hollol i'w llwybr a'i ddod yn y goled,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.200
a'r hyn yn dda iawn iawn, i ddod yn y goled a'i ddod yn y goled,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.200
a'i ddod yn y goled i'r Pansepreeth.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:24.200
Roedd yn dda iawn iawn, a'i ddod yn y goled,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.200
a dosed yn dda iawn iawn i'r Pansepreeth.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:36.200
Gallwn ni ddod yn y goled, a ddod yn y goled,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:42.200
a ddod yn y goled a'i ddod yn y goled,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.200
ac roeddwn ni'n mynd i'r gweithiau ddim,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.200
Yn y ffatrwyd, dwi'n credu, yn ymwneud â'ch llocet, roedd ymwneud yn 1957.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.200
Ie.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.200
A gallwch chi ddod o'ch gwerthfawr?

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:07.200
Roeddwn i'n dechrau o'r Bonaprith ar £2.9 a pan dweudwn i'r ffatrwyd, roedd £6.10,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.200
a oedd £0.50.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:16.200
Ond nid oes gennym ni gwych i'r ffatrwyd, oherwydd roedd nhw'n ymwneud yn y Uniyn.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.200
Rydyn ni'n clar, fel Gweinred, gweithiol noodlesores,

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.200
a flen shrimp silly.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.200
hen ti yw, Ganry highest,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:43.300
a' oedd freedwyr iawn

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.300
£2.9 o'r llwybr yn y siop.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.300
A oedd arall £11 oedd yw hynny?

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.300
Roeddwn ni ddim yn gweithio ar hynny, dwi ddim yn gweithio arall.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.300
Dwi ddim yn gwybod beth mae Eileen wedi cael, ond roedd yn ei wneud fy marn i £11.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.300
Ond roeddwn i'n ymwneud â'r peth, dros dros dros gwrs,

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.300
efallai yna ffyrdd o gydag, fe ddweudai ei fod yn gweithio,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.300
roeddwn yn gweithio, a byddwn yn ddangos, roeddwn yn cwestiwnio,

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.300
ond roeddwn yn gweithio, ond roeddwn yn gweithio,

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.300
ond roeddwn yn gweithio, oherwydd roeddwn yn y Uniynau.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:20.300
Roeddwn yn y Uniynau a'r Uniynau wedi cymryd,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:26.300
roedd wedi mynd dros y gwedd, ond roedd yn ymwneud â ni i ddweud.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.300
Ond roedd wedi deisio yna, yn y llwybr,

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.300
roedd wedi deisio gael ni £11.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.300
Roeddwn i'n dod yn y man, roeddwn i'n dweud,

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.300
How did that compare to what the workers in the factory were?

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.300
O, they were having much more than us in the office.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.300
Yeah, much more.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:53.300
Because they'd work shifts, and of course, night shift was higher rate than the day shift,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:59.300
and then of course overtime, they'd work overtime sometimes till eight o'clock.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:05.300
And their hours was eight, seven thirty till four,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.300
and then they went eight o'clock till half past four,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:15.300
and then of course if it was overtime then, they'd have that much overtime as well.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:22.300
And I worked, when I started there, I worked every other Saturday morning,

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.300
go down about half past nine until one o'clock,

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.300
but then we gradually did away with, we asked him,

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:35.300
he was only manning the phones and seeing to the mail really,

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.300
because sometimes he wouldn't come in, but we had to go in and do it.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:45.300
So we gave up that then, and then we're just five days a week.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.300
How many of you worked in the factory?

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.300
Fifteen to twenty, fluctuated from.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.300
Altogether?

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.300
Yes, we were the managing director, only the managing director in the office,

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:06.300
and then Eileen and myself, and then we got busy, so then we had a gentleman in with us,

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.300
and then Eileen's husband was working in the factory,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:16.300
but he found that the boss was saying, Eileen's wages and his wages,

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:21.300
they should have told them, be working only for one wage.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.300
Yes, right.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.300
So he said, I'm off, he said, so he went up to Great Yamath, and that's where he still is,

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:33.300
and then Eileen then, he wanted her to go, and she wouldn't go, and wouldn't go, and then she left then,

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:39.300
so it was myself then and different gentlemen, you know, they'd come and go and come and go,

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:47.300
they didn't stay long, and that's how we ended up, just myself and the gentleman.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.300
So were there any women working in manufacturing?

00:15:51.300 --> 00:16:01.300
Yes, yes. We had the wine-dine shop, and we knew there were four I think in there, sometimes four,

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:07.300
and then in the inspection it was Nella, she was the only one in the inspection,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:13.300
and then only one lady out on the shop floor with the boys, and of course she was having the man's rate,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.300
and they didn't agree with that, that she was having the man's rate,

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.300
but she was doing exactly the same work as the boys.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:28.300
I don't know why she was out on the factory floor, because that was before, no, she was there before I went there.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.300
So what did they do on the factory floor?

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:41.300
They knitted for the cotton, and then for the nylon, and then they were warping.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:48.300
We'd have the big bobbins, and then they'd have to be warped onto the beams,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:55.300
and the beams would be put on the machines for the knitting, you know, and it would be going like that all day long.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.300
Was it nice then?

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:06.300
Oh, and hot in the summer, you couldn't breathe in the summer in there.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:12.300
I'd take anything I wanted to talk to the boys about, I'd have to take them into the mess room,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.300
because you'd be exhausted trying to talk.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:23.300
You couldn't speak to them over the machine, there were 23 machines in the one shop, as long as this house.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:33.300
And then in the other we had six nylon, I think, with the warp in here, and then down the other end.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:40.300
So who didn't agree with this woman who was on the factory floor?

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.300
Oh, the knitters. How many were there?

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:55.300
Five to a shift? Four to a shift? Yeah, could have been.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.300
And Eileen as well.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:02.300
So who didn't agree with this woman being paid the same as the name?

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.300
The knitters, yeah.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.300
So the men then?

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.300
The men, yes, the men, yeah.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.300
What did the management think?

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:22.300
Well, it was only the boss, the manager, director, and he sort of didn't take any notice of it, I don't think.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.300
So he just paid the same wage without question?

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.300
Yes, yeah.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:34.300
She was having the same rate as the boys. It would be in there, I think, the same as the boys.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.300
What did you think?

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.300
Well, we didn't have a say in it. It was nothing to do with us really, you know.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.300
We were just in the office doing all the office work and sports.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:54.300
We didn't sort of, I can't remember ever, the two of us saying anything about it.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.300
It was one of those things. She was out there with them.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.300
Did you think it was fair or did you think she should have?

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:09.300
Well, it was at the time. It was before the time of equal pay came in, you see.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.300
So of course that's why they didn't think much of it.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:18.300
But then they didn't keep on about it and I think it could be done. So they just, I think, just forgotten.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:24.300
And then Nella left and then Eileen came out on the inspection then.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.300
So then it didn't bother them that whatever she was having.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.300
So it was quite a small factory then?

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:40.300
Yes, but we never owed a penny. Never in debt, never had overdrafts, nothing at all.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:45.300
When the boss died there was 200,000 money in the bank without all the assets.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:20:00.300
That was when, how old was I? 47, 48? 40 years ago, 30 odd years ago, that's right.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:06.300
You say the factory workers were paid more than you.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:11.300
Did you ever consider working in the factory rather than the office?

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:16.300
No, no, I couldn't have done that.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.300
Why?

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:24.300
Well, you were on your feet all day just walking around these machines all day and they were going like this all day.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.300
Like that all day.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.300
Oh my god, I haven't got any needles I don't think.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:37.300
Very, very fine needles. I've got the boxes, but I haven't got the needles.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.300
No, I haven't got any needles, very, very fine needles they were.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.300
And they were just going like that all day long.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.300
Would you say it was hard work?

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:53.300
Well, it would be hard on the feet and legs because Eileen now, she's 82 I think,

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.300
and she's having terrible trouble with her feet, she can't stand or walk.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:03.300
Her feet are sort of whatever it is, and of course it was cement floors.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.300
So it was hard on the feet and legs.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.300
So I'm sorry, what did Eileen do then?

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.300
Well, she was the knitter with the boys.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.300
Oh, she was the knitter?

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.300
She was the knitter with the boys, yeah.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:24.300
Well, we had two Eileen's, Eileen Evans and then Eileen Edwards.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.300
So was one of them in the office?

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:32.300
Yeah, Eileen Edwards is in the office and Ray Edwards was out in the nylon shop then, Eileen's husband.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.300
Yeah.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.300
Right, okay.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:42.300
Can you remember your first day at work and what impression that made on you?

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:50.300
I remember going in and waiting at the, thinking there was someone in there,

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.300
waiting at the hatch, knocking, knocking, and there was no one.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.300
And of course I was down there early, and in comes the boss,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.300
so then he took me in the office and then waited for Eileen to come in.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.300
But she never came to work until half past nine.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.300
I don't know why, but she never, and then, then,

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.300
sat down and she started to show me the ropes.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:16.300
And all strange the first day, you know, which everybody says,

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.300
it's bound to be strange, isn't it, yeah.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:24.300
And then as the week was going on then, and well, I was there all that time then.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.300
And oh, I did run it myself for nine weeks because Eileen had gone, had left.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:35.300
And he didn't have a man to come in, and I did it for nine weeks on my own.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.300
Well, I didn't have any extra money, but all of a sudden,

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.300
when the gold chains came in, he said,

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:45.300
you can go and look for something for yourself to the value of £100.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:52.300
So I went to Bridgend to a good jeweller's and it was £120, so I put the £20 myself.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:57.300
So I got the chain, you know, just an ordinary chain,

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.300
and I had that for nine weeks working on my own.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:06.300
Because of course, right end of the week, you had to come down to balance everything,

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:12.300
balance the petty cash, balance with the wages, and then with all the petty cash.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.300
Which I liked very much, I like handling money.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.300
Did you think that was a generous...

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.300
Well, to me then, I suppose it was.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:29.300
I suppose it was. I was thinking, oh, you know, my first gold chain, it was all in the region,

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:34.300
and I thought, well, gold chains, yeah, I did, yeah.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.300
What were the conditions like in the factory?

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:46.300
Not very good, because it was an old factory, very old factory, yeah, very, very old.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:51.300
Like the chairs we had, the kitchen chairs, and I got the pads out there

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.300
now that I made a pad to sit on.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.300
Oh, because sitting on those wooden chairs, it was.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.300
We had a pleshwin for himself and a big posh in the end.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:07.300
After the flood, he had a new desk and a new swivel chair, but we didn't.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.300
We had to just use what was there.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.300
No, did we have one new desk?

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.300
No, I don't think so.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:23.300
There was my desk, and in the middle then, it was like an old table, and then there was Eileen's desk.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.300
Oh, and that's right, we had the typewriter there, so I'd work there.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:31.300
And I got pictures of me in it, and I'm knitting,

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:37.300
because I used to have the fortnight of the factory holidays to go down

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.300
and man the phones and see to the mail.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.300
So, of course, there was nothing else to do, so I'd sit and knit.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.300
And then I had my holidays in July.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.300
I was at the fortnight before they did.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.300
Right, I'll talk to you about that in a minute.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:59.300
I just wanted to say, what about toilets and facilities like that?

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.300
Oh, there was a toilet, and we didn't have hot water.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.300
Did we have a geezer?

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:09.300
Ah, there was a very old geezer then, it went wrong, and he did buy us a new geezer,

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.300
for fashion geezers, for the hot water without hands.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.300
We had to go in, and there were two toilets and a hand wash basin.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.300
But then there was nothing to put your towel on,

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:28.300
so I said, I'm going to buy a roller, and I'm going to get roller towel,

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.300
because I hate towels in a ball lamp.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.300
So I did that when I went there after a bit.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:39.300
And then another thing then, with all our tea things,

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.300
they were using the bottle, and they were using, it was tea then,

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.300
it wasn't tea bags, of course.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:52.300
So I got a milk jug, and I got, oh, you would have cups and saucers.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.300
The boss would have cups and saucers, we did have cups and saucers.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:02.300
But then I bought a teapot, and I got tea cozy, I made a tea cozy,

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.300
and I did that.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.300
Then what else did I do then to try and bring it up to date?

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:15.300
No, it was very sparse, nothing sort of, no lecturies at all, no.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.300
So no canteen?

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.300
No, no, the boys out there, they had a room, a mess room,

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.300
and we did have, he did have a little portable, not a portable,

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:29.300
table gas stove, which would strike the match,

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.300
and he'd go and walk him out to make fees one day.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.300
You could warm something.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.300
And then on the top, the boys, did they ever let, no,

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.300
they'd buy the kettle on the top, we didn't let the kettles.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.300
No, no, the boys did not.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.300
Did the factory floor workers and you used to mix at all?

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.300
I mean, how about Eileen, did she used to mix with you, or did she?

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.300
Oh, yes, yes, Eileen and me, we'd go out to the boys, you know,

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.300
and the foremen then would come in to see and do and want to know

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.300
everything, and they heard foremen.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:09.300
And oh, I'd go into the mess room and the lunchtime to them

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:14.300
because it was quiet then, you see, the machines were all shut off.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:21.300
And yeah, but yeah, they were all right, all the boys were all right to me.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.300
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.300
And there was one in particular, he was like a, what was it?

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.300
Oh no, Len, he wasn't a general ham, but he'd do anything.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:36.300
If you needed something done, say, oh Len, has something gone wrong now

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.300
with the latch on the door, and oh, he'd say, I'm not coming now,

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.300
and all the time he'd be behind me with a hammer and something or a drill,

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.300
he was wonderful, he was, Len was, yeah, but he left,

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.300
then I went out to play with him and work.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.300
Yeah, they were from Tree Harvard, yeah.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.300
So how would you say you got on with the men?

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:02.300
Oh, all right, all of them, yeah, yeah, all of them all right.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:07.300
What about the women? Did you used to go out socially with them?

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:12.300
No, no. We did have a Christmas get-together,

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.300
which Eileen and myself, we'd arrange it.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.300
Otherwise, we wouldn't have had anything for Christmas,

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:24.300
but we did that, and we went to a few places for a few Christmas,

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.300
but we had to pay for it ourselves, like the boss wouldn't pay for it,

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:34.300
and we did that, and, oh yes, it was quite nice to get together like that,

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.300
because you couldn't go talking out in the factory,

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.300
because one morning I was out there, and he said, oh, come on,

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.300
he said those girls were at me, and they were talking to me,

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.300
but he wouldn't allow socialising on the shop floor, no.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:54.300
So were the workers allowed to talk to each other while they were working?

00:28:54.300 --> 00:29:01.300
Well, yes, I think they would, yeah, but then they needed it to watch, you see,

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:07.300
because these needles, if one went, you'd have a big ladder all the way down in the material,

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:13.300
so they had to sort of keep their eye on that all the time, and they were working like all the time.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:19.300
I mean, they did in the break time in the morning and lunch time.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.300
What about music? Did they...?

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:30.300
No, the boss wouldn't have music. No, nothing, no, nothing at all.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.300
In any case, if they did in the factory, they wouldn't have heard it,

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:38.300
because of the noise of the machines. Oh, they were really noisy machines, yeah.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.300
Did they have any protective clothing or ear protection?

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:47.300
No, no, nothing like that at all, because it hadn't come in then, all this protection,

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:53.300
for they should have, because it was really noisy on their ears, yeah.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:58.300
No, it was before the time of all this health and safety.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.300
Was the work dangerous at all, do you think?

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:10.300
No, not really, because it wasn't...

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.300
No, no, I wouldn't say it was a dangerous job.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.300
So you don't remember any accidents or anything like that?

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:23.300
No, no, no, no, no. We had an accident book, but...

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:31.300
No, I can't... No, didn't have any accidents, no.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:36.300
What about heat and lighting? Was it hot?

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:41.300
Oh, very, very hot. The strip lighting all down on the machines, you see,

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:47.300
for them to see the knitting as it was going, quite low on them, you know.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.300
Each side of the machine, they had the strip lighting.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.300
So was it hot in the winter as well? Yeah, yeah.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.300
And the bottom part of all the windows was all frosted glass,

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:03.300
so they couldn't see out at all, because it was the original windows, I think,

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:09.300
from wartime, you know, the frosted glass, yeah.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:13.300
So what about the office? Oh, we were the same.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.300
That's why I hate frosted glass.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:23.300
I had to get up on the radiator pipe on the site and open the window to have a look out,

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.300
because I couldn't see out.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.300
About the window was that much all the way around of frosted glass.

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:36.300
So were you ever cold in the office, or too hot or too cold?

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.300
Oh, very hot. Eileen, you see, she smoked as well.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.300
Oh, it used to be blow.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:48.300
And she'd light her, put it on the ashtray, and let the smoke go on.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.300
I couldn't breathe once. I thought I was bleeding out.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.300
I was bleeding out. I couldn't breathe.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.300
And she wouldn't have that much window open for it to go out.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:01.300
And when the sun was in the front, it was like if she was in the cinema, you know, the rays,

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.300
it would be like that, coming in with the smoke.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.300
Yeah, so when she'd come in, she'd light one up, and then it would be going up and up.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:14.300
I was a passive smoker, really, at the time, but I didn't think of it, you know.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:18.300
And the boss was smoking. I got in the ashtray upstairs.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.300
And he'd light it up like that, up like that.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:26.300
And all of a sudden, he gave it up overnight, because he found he had a little lest sit down in there.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:32.300
And then he thought smoking was a very dirty habit.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.300
So did he have a room of his own?

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:40.300
Yes, he had an office of his own, and then the end of it was called the boardroom.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.300
Why it was called the boardroom, I don't know.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:47.300
It was just that there were a few chairs in there, and we never had any board meetings, really.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.300
It was always called the boardroom.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:55.300
What about the people on the factory floor? Could they smoke?

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.300
Oh, they did then, going round, yeah.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.300
On the job?

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:03.300
On the job, they were, yeah, because years ago they did, didn't they?

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.300
They just smoked anywhere, like, hmm, yeah.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.300
I mean, now you think of it with that cotton, it was dangerous.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:13.300
What's that cotton on that nylon? I mean, the nylon just melts, yeah.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.300
Didn't think of it.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.300
No.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:24.300
Did your work change at all while you were there, or was it, you know, you were there for a long time?

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.300
No, not from the Monday morning, you see.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:32.300
You had different days for everything to Friday then, so finish on Friday.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:38.300
Everything had to be done every day to finish on Friday, to finish with a petty cash, so that it was balanced.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:44.300
And then you'd have Monday morning again, you'd have the sheets in then, from that week's work.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.300
It was a week in hand. And then you'd start all over again then.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.300
So that was the same for the whole time you were there?

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.300
Yeah.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:34:04.300
Did it matter whether you were married or not, you think?

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.300
You said there was a problem with Eileen.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.300
Yeah, because she went up to the arm of the work and live.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:20.300
And no, no, it's just that she had a mother, you see, and a mother had a little boy.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:25.300
And she didn't want to leave her mother in Trehaverd.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:33.300
But in the end, he said, well, it's either also, it's either divorce and part and divorce, or, but in the end she went up.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.300
Hmm. Yeah.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:45.300
Were you encouraged to go to night school when you were there and further yourself?

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.300
No, nothing like that at all. No, no.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:54.300
No, nothing at all. And another thing we didn't have were no pension schemes.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:59.300
He didn't believe in anything like that. He was all to make his own money, you know.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:05.300
He didn't believe in anything like that at all. No, no.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.300
So you said you weren't in a trade union?

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.300
No, no, Eileen and myself, no. Nothing at all.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.300
But do you remember which trade union?

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:21.300
Yes, Nitta. Oh, dear, I should know it off by heart.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.300
No, hmm. Can't remember that now.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:31.300
It was the Nitta's union. It was up north because that's where a lot of the factories were up north, all the textile.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.300
Textile, no, no, National Textile Union.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:43.300
Oh, dear, I can't, I can't say. I remember the name of the union.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.300
I should know it. No, I can't remember the name of the union.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.300
But it was in the textile union, it was.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.300
Yes, we were under the textile, yeah.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:57.300
Were there any disputes or problems and stuff while you were there?

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:05.300
No, we were, no, we'd just carry on, sail along all the time.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:11.300
No, not really. No, they didn't sort of have any strikes or no.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.300
I think they weren't, no, they were very, very good.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:23.300
Did you feel that you and the other workers were fairly treated?

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:30.300
Yes, I suppose we were. We weren't, yeah.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.300
Was he a good employer then?

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.300
Yes, only that he never wanted to give us a rise. No.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:49.300
Tell me a little bit about your employer then, who he was and his family.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:56.300
Checils of Argyn, I can't bring it all out. Checils of Argyn, who he was.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:05.300
And he came, I think before my time this was, he came over and he started with Stewart Singlem,

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:16.300
which was across the road up a bit on the estate, and then he had this then in 1940, 41 I expect,

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:24.300
and started upon his own, and then he had a sleeping partner up in London, which would come down every so often,

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:32.300
but he was a man in director, he did everything, you know, buying, everything, the machines.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.300
What was his name?

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:39.300
Carole Bergman. Bergman. Yeah.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:45.300
And didn't know anything about his personal life, he'd never come out with any of his personal life.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:53.300
I've learnt more from the paper cut-ins now that I've read, because he never said anything,

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:57.300
that Mrs Bergman was his wife, but didn't say like what happened with her,

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:06.300
she had a little boy in the concentration camp and that, and Eva, and then he took Eva on, you see,

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:18.300
and then they named her Eva Bergman. Other than that, I never, no, we never, and he never socialised himself,

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:25.300
he didn't go out with other men or anything, you know, for an evening, nothing at all like that,

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:31.300
and I don't think they went very far either, so there was nothing really to say about,

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:38.300
we never sort of said we'd go out with him for an evening with his wife, or no, we just went home, you know,

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.300
went to work and went home every night and it was the same.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:51.300
Every, yeah, there was nothing, no, nothing sociable about him, so he didn't,

00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:03.300
so I can't give you anything about, really about what, no, all I knew was that he went to Switzerland that morning,

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:08.300
stayed the night and then went the morning, five o'clock, and died in the airport,

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:15.300
and then that day we were taken over by Burlington Fabrics then, over to Philly, so we had to go over there then.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.300
So when, what year was that then?

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:32.300
Oh dear, what year was that then? I was, I'd have to have a pencil I think.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.300
I'll ask you something.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.300
Go on then.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:49.300
So I wanted to ask you, what did you do with your wages? Did you keep all your wages or did you, you know, did you?

00:39:50.300 --> 00:40:00.300
Yes, yeah, we had, all of us had our cash, because I'd go on a Thursday afternoon to the bank

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:06.300
and then made the wages up for the night shift to put them out with the foreman,

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:13.300
ready for the night shift foreman to come in, because they only worked four, four ten hour shifts when there were nights,

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:20.300
and then five hour, five days, eight hour shifts. So everybody had cash.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:27.300
We'd not put it in the bank or anywhere for them then, it was all cash in the envelopes. Yeah.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:35.300
When you started working there, were you still living at home then?

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.300
Yes, I'd been home all the time.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.300
So did you used to give your mother?

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:44.300
Oh yes, my mother every Friday night, the two of us, yeah, hand out, we all would.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.300
My mother kept our wages until we were both twenty-one and gave us pocket money,

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:52.300
but when we came twenty-one, because you wasn't out to do, I'd look after.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:57.300
And then we had to give, she believed in it, board and lodge.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:05.300
Right. Was that about the age that everybody did that, you know, that twenty-one, did you go?

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:10.300
I don't know whether it was everybody else, but my mother didn't believe in letting us have all our wages,

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.300
because we wouldn't know the value of any.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:16.300
We were thinking every Friday we had that, oh we're going to spend it and then nothing left for the week.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:21.300
We went like that. But that means there are some people who are like that,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:26.300
and once they've got their wages, they've got to go on by Saturday morning like it's gone.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:33.300
No, no, no, we had to bring ours home every Friday and she'd sit down with two of us, with our hand out.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.300
So what did you do with your pocket money?

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:43.300
When I was young, well I just had to make a drill for the week, whatever I wanted.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:48.300
I just had to make a drill for the week. I had six and six, well how much is that in new money?

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.300
And just make a drill.

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.300
Did you have to pay for your transport out of that?

00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:01.300
No, my mother paid for it out of my wages for the season ticket.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:07.300
So that was all kind of for you to spend. Did you have to buy clothes out of that?

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:13.300
No, whatever we bought, my mother always came with us and paid for it.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:17.300
Because of course we didn't have that amount of money. It wasn't enough.

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:23.300
It was only for sweets or chocolate or whatever.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.300
We didn't go to pictures, we weren't allowed to go to pictures.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:33.300
We did go to youth club. Janet went to Young Farmers, but I went to the youth club in the village.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.300
What else? Nothing else.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.300
Did you buy records or anything?

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:44.300
Oh yes, I'd buy up, but not very often because we didn't have the money to spend.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.300
I always had to come home on a Tuesday when I worked in the shop.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:53.300
We had a Thursday afternoon. That was my job, ironing, to do all the ironing.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:43:01.300
Then in the summer, we'd just go out in the garden, change then and have your tea and then work out in the garden.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.300
In the winter nights, we'd just sit by the fire. We all sat in one room.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:11.300
We didn't have this business like they've got today up to their bedroom. My father wouldn't allow that.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:17.300
No, no. Never had a wireless or television up there. Nothing, George.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:22.300
You'd go up and go into bed and then get up in the morning and come down.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:31.300
So when you had your own money and paid board and lodge, did you used to buy more clothes and things after that?

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:36.300
Well, not unless I wanted it. It was never, ever broke.

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:42.300
If you wanted something, you had to have the money on your hand before you went to buy it.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:48.300
You didn't go and then no credit at all. No credit, nothing.

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:53.300
So we didn't have clothes every week or every month.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:59.300
I'd look after it, put all the summer clothes away for the winter and all the winter clothes away for the summer.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:04.300
Amps sandals, bring them out then in the summer. That's what I still do now.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:10.300
Clean them all up through the bottom, put them all away and then I'd be glad to get the summer ones out.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:15.300
I hate these long sleeves, especially when they're washing up.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.300
I'd be glad to get rid of them.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:25.300
No, we've had to look after everything and never abused anything.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.300
We've had our own cars, we had to keep them clean and look after them.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:34.300
When we had bikes then, we had to look after bikes.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:38.300
I've worked since I can remember, about seven years of age.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:44.300
We never said to my father, what we get for it, we didn't get a penny, my sister or myself.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:49.300
Now I'm having my time of life really, because I'm having everything.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.300
I don't spend it because I've got to get rid of it.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.300
It's just, oh, I like that, oh yeah, I think I'll have that.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.300
Oh, I like that pair of shoes, yeah, I'll try them.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.300
Oh, they're nice, I'll have them, or sandals or whatever.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:06.300
I bought a pair of slippers yesterday, I don't really want them.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.300
But they'll go up in the box for next winter now, because they're nice.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.300
They come up over my ankles on the front, so it'll be cosy.

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:18.300
Not booties, but you can put them, but that's the type of thing.

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:24.300
So no, never had anything, unless we had the money to.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.300
Never went to the hairdressers, never smoked.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:32.300
My father said, come buy that drawer there with the cigarette in your bag, he said.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.300
And he said, I'll ram it down your throat and open the choke you,

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.300
but we never had the money to buy them, you see.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:43.300
And my mother told us, you buy a jumper, or you buy a cardigan or a pair of shoes,

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.300
you've got something to look at.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.300
Well, if you have the cigarette, you might as well put the money there,

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.300
cos you've got nothing after.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.300
But we never had that.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:55.300
As I said, six and six a week, I know they were cheaper then,

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:59.300
but it was dear then at that time, wasn't it?

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:03.300
They were, you know, and I think they were eight pounds for a pocket of cigarettes

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.300
and you've got nothing after.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.300
Beth?

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.300
Do you smoke?

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.300
No, no, no.

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.300
Never.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.300
What was I going to say?

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.300
Well, we go on to the holidays then.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.300
That right, we're back on the holidays, aren't we?

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:24.300
So, could you tell me about the holidays?

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:31.300
We started in April, we had Easter Monday and Tuesday off,

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:36.300
and then each Witson we'd have the Monday off.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:42.300
Then in July, then they'd have the last week of July, first week of August,

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.300
but then I'd have the last week of June and the first week of July,

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.300
cos I worked the fortnight that the factory was off,

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.300
manning the phones and seeing to the mail.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:57.300
And then come Christmas, we'd have the two weeks off,

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:06.300
one the Christmas week and then one before on the New Year's Day.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.300
But then they decided then, they preferred,

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.300
could they have the last two weeks of August off?

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.300
So for years then they did that.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.300
I just remember they changed it.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:20.300
But they weren't very fessy because the nights were beginning to draw in then,

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.300
in August, you see, they didn't have a long afternoon, did they?

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.300
But they kept to it and that's what they wanted.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:33.300
It wasn't so crowded, they said, because it was miners, factory, schools,

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.300
and it all out then.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:38.300
So that was the holidays.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.300
Were they all paid holidays?

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:46.300
Only the bank holidays, the Monday, Tuesday, yeah,

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.300
and the Christmas and Boxing day.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.300
What about the summer fortnight?

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:57.300
Yes, just the basic it was.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.300
They had no, no, the basic rate.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:04.300
They didn't have the bonus of their work, you know, the knitting bonus.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.300
No, just the basic, I just come to that.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.300
Yeah, that's all.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.300
So what did you do during the holidays?

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:15.300
When I was there, when I'd be waiting for the phone to ring,

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.300
I'd see to the mail, I'd take any checks that we had down to the bank

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.300
and then I'd sit and I'd be knitting.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.300
And then I'd have my cup of coffee or whatever

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:27.300
and I'd leave about half past two then.

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.300
I thought there was nothing going on.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.300
So I'd come home then and that was my, I used to say,

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:37.300
it was like two weeks holiday or a month holiday

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.300
because it was only sitting there.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.300
He wanted someone there because he went away as well.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:47.300
And so it was, you know, a rest for me.

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.300
For me, it didn't sort of really work.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.300
So I enjoyed it, yeah.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.300
Was it only you in the factory?

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.300
Yes, it was eerie.

00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.300
After all that noise and to walk out into the factory,

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:05.300
it was really eerie. It was, yeah.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.300
So what did you do when you actually had the time off?

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.300
You said you went away, did you?

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.300
Oh yes, we used to go on holiday, yes.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.300
My friend June and I, one year we went a week,

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:19.300
I think the first time we went on holidays was a week to Bournemouth.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:24.300
And then Joyce and I went away with Cornwall.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.300
And then before my sister started work then,

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:31.300
the three of us went to Switzerland on a coach tour.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:41.300
And then afterwards then, well, it was down West Wales, Cornwall.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:46.300
Oh, then we went to Land's End to John O' Groats.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:49.300
Where else did we go?

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:52.300
You know, we didn't do it all.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:57.300
We went due to Land's End and due to John O' Groats, and to Scotland.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:01.300
Where else did we go?

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:05.300
Oh, we went abroad again to Italy.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.300
That's right.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:13.300
Italy, Austria, Switzerland.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.300
When was this? What decade?

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:19.300
It was different times, I think.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.300
When you went abroad, what decade was that?

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.300
Oh, now you're asking me something.

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:30.300
What was your favourite country?

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:35.300
I went to Jersey, the Fortnight.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:41.300
I went to Guernsey.

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.300
I've never fancied America.

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.300
It's never appealed to me, or Ireland, or...

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:49.300
It's either the Channel Islands, or...

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:52.300
And it's only Switzerland or Austria.

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.300
Of course, with the coach, too.

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.300
You come from Germany or France, but I didn't fancy France.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:01.300
Yes, it was all different when I was...

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.300
Well, I haven't had a holiday for 20 years.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.300
20 going on.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.300
Yes, over 20 years now I haven't had a holiday.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:12.300
I couldn't have holidays, anything, because both my parents were beginning to get older

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:16.300
and beginning to go downhill, so there was no one.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.300
I didn't have my sister to take over.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.300
I was 21 years old, I've got 22 coming out.

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:28.300
So, yeah, I didn't have a holiday for over 20 years.

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:31.300
Now I haven't got anybody to go with.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.300
I'm not going on my own.

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:36.300
They always say, go on your own, you'll soon go with Sargen.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.300
No, I couldn't do that.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.300
No.

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:46.300
Were you allowed days off for personal reasons?

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.300
Well, you'd ask for them.

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.300
I'd ask for a day off for my sister's wedding, and he more or less said,

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.300
well, have you got to have it off?

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.300
Well, I said, like, my sister's getting married on a Monday,

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:01.300
and I'm going to be a witness, because she had a special licence,

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.300
and she went to the registry office.

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:11.300
And I more or less, well, you know, it's only for my sister's wedding.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.300
But he wasn't very fussy.

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.300
Oh, no.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:18.300
Because we couldn't make it up, you see, or anything,

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.300
but he didn't eat up to me anyway.

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:24.300
But he wasn't very, no, he didn't believe in holidays,

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:30.300
because he used to say to his, it's not another holiday, bank holiday again.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:35.300
He was a workaholic, you know, so he didn't believe in holidays, really.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.300
But he paid you the day you went to his sister's wedding?

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.300
Yes, yes.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.300
Other than that, I can't remember.

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.300
Did I ask for a time off other than that?

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:49.300
I think it was the only time that I asked.

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:53.300
Yeah, I think it was good.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:53:00.300
So you worked on the Treforst Estate for a long time,

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:04.300
and can you describe to me what the Treforst Estate was like

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.300
when you started working there?

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:12.300
All the old factories from the war, the real, real old,

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.300
they were the old factories from the war,

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:18.300
because we'd go to Tantig on the Bess,

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:21.300
then we'd go down through the one field, down through the other,

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:27.300
and then come down and we'd walk through GCs,

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:34.300
and then, oh, and Linus was there, and the smell from the Linus, oh, the bone factory,

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.300
and then there was...

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.300
What was the smell, sorry?

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.300
Linus with gelatine with all the bones.

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.300
They used to go...

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:47.300
As we were leaving the fields, we'd come down to it and go...

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:52.300
It was terrible.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.300
And I can name a lot of the factories down there.

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:59.300
I'd go round, and very often when my mother was alive, I'd say,

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.300
where are you going? She'd say, I'm going round to see how it went.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:05.300
I said, a blinking, Greg's a...

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.300
All over our patch!

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:11.300
There's nothing of the factory left, no, it's all Greg's lorries.

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:16.300
But I'd go round and say, oh, this is this one now, GC, DCL,

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:21.300
and then chrome leather, western board, aerozip,

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:27.300
Tiforacic printers, and I'd go up around, and then Linus,

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:31.300
but where we used to walk down was GC there, oh,

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.300
and they used to have the canteen starting up in the mornings,

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:37.300
and the old smell where they made chips.

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.300
That was another smell.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:43.300
And then there was...

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:48.300
Oh, they used to sell wood, Florida, Robinson, Florida, I think it was called.

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:52.300
Then there was Stuart Singlem, then there was plastic engineers,

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:56.300
then there was Hometons, and then there was Elliot's Glass,

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.300
and then by us then there was Rosedales.

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:03.300
We were in a big block, but a small block in a big block,

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.300
and I can't remember the name next door.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:10.300
Oh, and there was Hulses, I was all the further over.

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:15.300
I can't remember the name next door to us, in the same block,

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:19.300
but just all different, I can't remember that one.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.300
I've been trying to think of that one for a long time,

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.300
and I can't remember it, is it funny?

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.300
I can remember all the others in the factory,

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:30.300
and down on the main avenue there was state printers, co-op shoes,

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:36.300
KLGs, BOHC, copygraph.

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:43.300
What's the ones now that they've done away with now?

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:45.300
There's disabled, oh, there was the blind down there,

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.300
then there's this Remploy.

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.300
There was a big Remploy down on the main avenue.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:51.300
Yeah.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.300
But describe to me what it was like, you know,

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.300
first thing in the morning and last thing at night.

00:55:56.300 --> 00:56:01.300
Well, outside our office was the bus station

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.300
for all the buses from the valleys.

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:08.300
And it would take, if I went up to Tree Forest,

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:11.300
from Tree Forest to the state, up to Tree Forest,

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.300
it would take me a half an hour at least,

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:16.300
because it would stop, start, stop, start, all,

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:18.300
it would double-decker, single-decker,

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:22.300
it was chock-a-block with buses.

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:25.300
And now it's just gone, now it's all derelict there,

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.300
nothing at all.

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:31.300
And what a noise they'd be coming about quarter to five.

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:34.300
Oh dear, dear, dear, you know, all in the line,

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.300
waiting for the vault to come out of the rich factory.

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:40.300
Because now it's all cars, and they'll have to use them,

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.300
they went to cars.

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.300
Yeah.

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:46.300
But then I'd walk up, and then I came,

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.300
I was walking up on my own, and I wouldn't go through the fields then on my own,

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:54.300
so I'd walk up the roadway, because it wasn't very nice,

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.300
I didn't fancy coming on my own, and it wasn't, no.

00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:00.300
Going down in the morning, we'd be about 12 of us,

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:03.300
all going to different factories.

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.300
Yeah.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:10.300
So when your boss died, you said it was taken over by?

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.300
By Burlington.

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:14.300
By Burlington.

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.300
And it moved to, because really, tell me about that.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.300
We moved over to Cattifford.

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:23.300
They were at the back of us, it was called Burlington Gloves,

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.300
but then they went over to, when they were over there,

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.300
then they went into a bigger, much bigger factory,

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:34.300
and it was Burlington Fabrics, and a huge office,

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:39.300
and a much bigger factory altogether than ours.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:45.300
And they did all types of material, not just like we did,

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.300
they did it for the furniture.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:50.300
What else?

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:54.300
Well, I wasn't really told, we just went in there,

00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:59.300
and just sort of mixing with the girls, I wasn't told what they did.

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:04.300
It wasn't, no, and they were, oh dear, dear, dear,

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:11.300
really fancy themselves, and they didn't have a penny to bless themselves with.

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.300
They just put it like that.

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:17.300
And they looked at the nose, it was as if it were riffraffs.

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:23.300
That's what, the office manager as well, he'd be on his glasses, I don't know.

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:28.300
And that's, I just went to work there, that's all, I wasn't sort of interested at all.

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.300
I did, and he did ask me then to cash up every night then,

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:35.300
because we had a factory shop, so he gave me that job.

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:38.300
But I went first on it.

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:42.300
I didn't like it there, just one of those things, I didn't like it there.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:48.300
So then he called us in and made us redundant, and I had a large sum of £3,050.

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:52.300
And he thought he was giving me the earth.

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:58.300
He said, oh dear, dear, you're having £3,000, oh Lord.

00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:00.300
But that wasn't much, was it?

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:03.300
After that was 31 years of working.

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.300
So he put the two together, right?

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.300
So I came out of there and that's it.

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:11.300
But it's all gone now.

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:15.300
They changed hands, I don't know how many times since I left there, now it's gone.

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.300
All gone now.

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:31.300
And you left eventually in, is it 1988? Is that right?

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:36.300
I was made redundant and I was 54.

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:42.300
So 54 from 1978 is 34 years, is it?

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:48.300
34 from 1990.

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.300
Yeah.

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:59.300
I was on the door then for 12 months.

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:02.300
Then I delivered my savings then for another 12 months.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.300
I didn't get a penny, I wasn't entitled to a penny.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:12.300
Then I went then to the social services, well, Old Ray House in Potiprath on Broadway.

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:15.300
I did 13 weeks there from nine until one.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:21.300
And I had £60 a week so that I could put stamps on then and I had another year then, door.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:26.300
And until I was 60, I had not a penny until I was 60, until I had my pension.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:30.300
So that's 24 years ago, isn't it?

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.300
Yes, 24, yes.

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.300
So about 1989.

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.300
Yes.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:42.300
Did you enjoy working in the factory office, the first year?

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.300
Yes, I did, yes.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.300
What about job satisfaction, were you bored at all?

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:51.300
No, never bored.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:56.300
Were you given a gift or anything when you left?

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.300
No, whenever I had a thing.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:05.300
I only had these different things because I was asking for it to show that I had, you know, what I'd done.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:11.300
And I only had that because I wanted something that could be, and I was looking and looking.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:16.300
I went and then I had it inscribed, you see, and because what is it?

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.300
It's a, oh, I'm worried about my glasses on.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.300
Who gave you this?

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.300
The boss then.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:27.300
And I got a bracelet with it on inside.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.300
Oh, I don't know where I put it on.

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.300
I know I haven't lost it.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:40.300
But inside the bracelet is engraved another year and then I got a brandy with another so many years.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.300
But I didn't have anything.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.300
I was thinking of that before you were right.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.300
None of us had a thing when we finished.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:50.300
And I got it been a year.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:56.300
Howard had been an aunt, Denzel is a brother.

01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:03.300
Arthur and Howard, they were both foremen.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.300
But of course they didn't when they died.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.300
No, we never had a thing when he died.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.300
Never sort of, nothing at all.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.300
No, nothing.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.300
She didn't give us anything.

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.300
No.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:24.300
Looking back now then, how do you feel about the time you worked in the factory?

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.300
Good.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.300
Yeah, alright.

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.300
Are you in touch?

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:33.300
We never sort of had a crossword, I mean of myself.

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:39.300
And there was only one chap that came in and he used to be, no two.

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.300
Two.

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:44.300
So he really wanted to take over.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:47.300
And two I wasn't very fussy of.

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:54.300
But I had a lovely one then and he only came to finish, he was sixty, sixty-three.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:03:01.300
And he came in until he was sixty-five and lo and behold he went home one night and he sat in the chair and died.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.300
And he was a knight, he was.

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:08.300
He was from a director, he was in South Printers and he finished him off there.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.300
And then he really enjoyed it.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.300
But he went home and he died in the chair.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.300
Big smoke that he was as well and he gave up smoking.

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.300
And then it just got to happen to him.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:24.300
Are you in touch with anybody?

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:29.300
Well Eileen died two years just gone in December.

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:32.300
She was eighty-two I think.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:41.300
And when I sent Ray the card to Gwyd Iamod, he's coming down because they've got a house still in Treehaverd.

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:47.300
So I told him whenever he comes down, he did come down two years ago and I had a visitor.

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.300
It's always the same.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.300
This young man was with him of course.

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.300
It was Gareth.

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:56.300
And he was fifty-two.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.300
I didn't know who he was of course.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.300
He said Gareth.

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:03.300
Last time I saw him it was a lovely little boy though.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:10.300
And then there's Eileen in Fondale but this Christmas is the first Christmas I am at a card.

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.300
Then there's a cleaner.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:16.300
She lived on Hawthorne and occasionally we phoned but she's ninety-four now.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:21.300
And then there was a lady then, Nellera was in inspection.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.300
I was looking after her from the end.

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:27.300
I was taking her to her to her plastic stockings.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:30.300
I was taking her to the hospital because she had no one.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.300
So I had to do journeys up there.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.300
Then she had cancer in the eye and she had her eye out.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:45.300
Then I stayed down in Morrison Hospital because she had to do her treatment every day.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.300
But she died three years ago.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.300
Three years after August I think.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.300
Who else is alive?

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:58.300
Oh, I don't know what you'd wish on a ship.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.300
Yes, he might still be alive.

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.300
Other than that I think they've all gone.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:09.300
You know, the ones that I haven't seen any other men like that's out in the factory

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.300
because they lived in all different places.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.300
So yes, that's about it.

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.300
That's a lot of it.

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.300
Yeah, that's right.

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:29.300
The cotton that you made in the factory, what was it used for?

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.300
The making of gloves.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:34.300
The white was for police gloves.

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:37.300
Try that now.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.300
It's 100% cotton.

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:49.300
Then whatever colour, this happened to be the Charmar because they were used for lens cleaners.

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:53.300
You know, they'd be cut that much.

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:59.300
Like that and put in the glass cases right now.

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:05.300
And then these used to be made into swatches or sent to customers.

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.300
Like Eileen would cut them like that.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:18.300
Then bend them over.

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:25.300
Bend them over.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:31.300
And staple them to send to customers for the colours they wanted and then they'd order.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:37.300
See, that was called a swatch.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:41.300
The nylon then was nylon gloves.

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:46.300
And then we started to go into dress fabrics with the nylon.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.300
But I wouldn't fist on the nylon.

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.300
No, no, no, that's all cotton.

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:53.300
Yeah, that's the...

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.300
They all want to see this when they say, what did you do?

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.300
And I'm glad I brought these home.

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:03.300
Yeah, that was lovely, wasn't it?

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:14.300
The raw material would be sent up to Nottingham to be dyed.

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.300
And then brought back to us in rolls.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:21.300
And then the orders that we'd get for the rolls then would be sent to Hong Kong,

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.300
all in the colours, to be made into gloves.

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:30.300
And then the customers, the glove factories all around then,

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:37.300
would be having the fabric then to make into gloves and we wouldn't see it after.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:43.300
So that was the... yeah, that's how much of it.
