00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I think one of my feelings, certainly I was very welcomed to the village from the word go, but that was nice.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And a lot of people reached out to me.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I think reaching out when you go into new communities is a two way traffic.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Often people come in and say, oh, they're not very friendly, not very strange, you know, they don't bother me or whatever.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But it's a two way traffic. You have to be kind to people and they will generally speak and respond very well.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And that was certainly a feature that I felt and was very quickly made, made friends in the village who you felt that you'd known all your life and always been part of.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So there was that sort of community feeling which was extended to people coming into the village.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Everybody is welcome. And it's a great pity that in the current context, of course, we cannot do the social events.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So we're missing out on things like the carol service, which always attracts all the people going round the village carol singing, children's Christmas party, harvests, just lunch in the hall or whatever.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But there's a whole lot of things where people had the opportunity to come together.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And I think we probably all miss that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Not a great frequenter of the union, but that's another social part of the village, which cannot function at the moment.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And I think we do all miss that.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I had a lot of contacts with the people, of course, through the church.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I do quite a few things for the churches in this neck of the woods.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But again, you can't be doing that much at the moment either.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So I got to know a lot of people in this part, not only in the village here, but around Radnyshire within quite a radius of this because I was fortunate to frequently got asked to go to talk to them about various things.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And meet people through that.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We are low density of population and tend to feel that you know people from miles around, I think quite quickly get to know lots of people because there aren't actually lots of people to get to know.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's much easier than in a town situation.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And everybody speaks and everybody is friendly.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
That is one of the things that weighs against some of the disadvantages of living here.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Six miles from the nearest main roads.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Somebody ingested to me while ago, have you got your bus pass yet, which I can take both ways.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
There's no point in six miles to the nearest bus stop.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And so these are disadvantages.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But the advantages in the community are great.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Again, in the situation with the COVID, we are lucky we can walk miles, not see anybody.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We almost but not quite live in isolation anyway.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So yeah, we've got a lot to be thankful for.
