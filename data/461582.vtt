00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A oes yna rhywbeth yn cymryd i'w gyrraedd ymlaen?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
O, oes, oes. Roedd hi'n gyrraedd ymlaen, oes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'r amlwg.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A fy mod i'n gweld,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
yn ymlaen, fel y bod y corwain wedi bod yn 53,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
ond roedd, yno, i'r plant.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Ond, dwi'n credu, yna, 1969,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
yn ddiweddar, roedd yna ddod o plant yn y mlynedd.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Yn y mlynedd.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Felly roedd hi'n ddod o ffamiliau,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
a'r plant yn ddod oâ€¦

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Ond roedd hi'n ddod o'r atmosfer

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
i'r investidur, fel roedd hi'n ddod o'r corwain.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Why do you think that was?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Because people didn't really think a lot about it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I mean, a lot of people say,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
why are they doing any carnaval and castle type of thing?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You know?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And then people would say,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
well, that was where the first Prince of Wales was,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and they say, was it?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You know, and things like that.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So I don't think people really thought so much about the investiture,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
because he was already known as the Prince of Wales.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You know, from 1958 in the Empire Games,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
when she announced I'd make my son Charles Prince of Wales.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So when the investiture came,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
he'd been already for all them 11 years,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
known as the Prince of Wales,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so people thought, well, what about it?
