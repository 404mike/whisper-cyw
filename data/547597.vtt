00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The world away to thee alone, from sin and death we came.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And he who would the Father see, must seek him, Lord, by thee.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Thus therefore never, yes, we are, beneath the mountain range.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The hookless ear of faith, the love, the ear of love may bleed.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:32.000
For still unquench'd with the great voice, Thou leadest not the way.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But all human in power, Christ, dead, holy, young, and free.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Thou art the truth, my word alone, through wisdom and in heart.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Thou only canst give form the mind, and purify the heart.
