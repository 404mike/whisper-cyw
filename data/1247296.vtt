You're listening to Stephen talking about a long-distance relationship in his past.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.840
I've had my first girlfriend, really interesting story this is. I went to the Welsh Games

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.680
to represent the South Welsh team. We had the events in the afternoon and then in the evening

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.920
then they said we're going to pick the best people to go to Cardiff, meet the mayor and the mayoress

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.280
and have a buffet. Certain ones from South Wales would go, mid and west of North Wales.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.520
So he picked me and my other friend. So we met them and then Christine was there,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.720
just there, my other one there. And I seen Christine sitting there with her medals. She was on her own

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.800
so I went over to her and I said is it okay if I sit by her? Is anybody sitting there? And she said no.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.920
So we started talking to her. My coach was there but I forgot to tell my coach we were getting

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.320
interested with each other talking. And then I got to know her then in a party and then I

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.680
asked her for her address where she lives. I found it was Aberystwyth.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.160
And so her mother said to Christine, I had a letter, we said oh we're right back and

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.440
forth as pen friends. So I went back and forth for a year and then the following year and in

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.680
the next world games I met her mother. And her mother said, so she said come back for a couple

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.480
of days. The first time I went up there my father took me up to meet him. He stayed in a hotel and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:34.080
I stayed at Christine's place and that was in August. And he said then I went successful. And then

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.880
after that we just got to know each other. She came down to my house every Easter. I'd go up

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.720
to Aberystwyth for eight days over Easter or she'd come down to my place. You had a long

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.600
distance relationship? Yeah and I went on for about 12 years. 12, 13 years, a long time. And then when

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.800
I moved up there I wanted to move to Aberystwyth. There was a bungalow up there I was going to move.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.600
So Christine came down that was in, I know the year that was. Parents came down in 1996.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.160
We said I want to move up to, we had a round table talk with her parents, man was in.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.840
And they said too much responsibility, you can't move to Aberystwyth. Who said that then? Her mother.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.600
My mother said back to her mother, give them a six months trial to see where you get on. But she

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.920
wasn't having that. So it didn't happen? No. Her parents stopped it. So what happened then?

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.760
What happened? She met a friend who lived in Lampeter. And then on that, and she was going

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.960
with him, but then I went up there for the Christmas party and Christine said to her mother,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.120
and she knew I'd looked at that fella, she said oh I want to marry Stephen, me now. Mother said no,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.240
we can't do that, we got a secret. And then I went back to my mum and they said stop it,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.760
it's like a hand in a fire. Just stop the relationship, we stopped it then. Because we're not going anywhere.
