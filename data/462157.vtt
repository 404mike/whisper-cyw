00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
Obviously the television concentrated a lot on the violence of the strike and I know there

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.040
was violence.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:18.200
And the conflict, the physical conflict is what sticks in my mind.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.600
But I also remember, I don't know because I'm looking at the TV because I'm picturing

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.560
it on the screen, you know, that's the only way I can get it in my mind.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200
Although the TV's not on unfortunately.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:41.720
Interviewing, you know, I know they interview people locally, talking on there.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:51.320
A lot of what was on there didn't really relate to the people that you knew around here, you

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.680
know, who were just doing their best to try and keep their livelihoods going.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.560
But it was, you know, the horses and the police in their gear and everything.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.840
So yeah, it did make an impression.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:19.360
Do you think that the portrayal of the miners was a fair one?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:30.480
Well obviously the portrayal of the ones who were very active in going out and physically

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.080
trying to fight the corner came over.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:48.800
But I think the TV to a large extent was showing them at their worst then.
