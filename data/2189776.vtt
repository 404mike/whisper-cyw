00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church, Llandudno, during the Longest Yarn.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.760
I'm speaking to Arianne Strange, who's going to tell us about her mum.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.560
Arianne, welcome and I'm dying to hear all your memories.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.040
Well, my mum's name was Joyce May Williams and she lived in Blenai Faustiniogh.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.840
During the war, they used to make hand grenades in Penrinday Drith.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.960
Many a nice used to talk about it when I used to work in the local fish and chip shop.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.400
You'd go home with a bag of chips and you'd share these stories.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.440
And you'd share these stories with your mum and she was happy to talk about it.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.880
And what special things did she tell you? Because it must have been an amazing time.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.240
When they made the hand grenades, they used to leave a message inside.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.320
And I don't think it was the real things they used to put in it.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.840
Like they would say blonde.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.360
Blonde when they went.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.840
And then I remember her saying that one day they had a visit from a soldier whose

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.640
this hand grenade had saved his life.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.160
And he came to see the woman that had put her name down.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.360
He'd found the note in the hand grenade and she effectively had saved his life.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.480
Did he say how?

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.800
She didn't say properly.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.360
I couldn't.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.920
Well, I can't remember, you know, but he must have used it.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.760
And then he found this message and he came to thank her.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.800
Goodness, that must have been amazing for her.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.640
What sort of messages did they put in?

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.200
Do you know?

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.680
They used to say blonde, blue eyes, Blenifestiniog and the names.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.640
So they'd come and this lady just had a visit.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.400
Did they all do it?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.320
Was it quite common or was it just your mum doing it?

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.600
It was quite common.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.960
And as she was saying, you know, they used to have to wear the turbans

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.800
because the powder that they worked with used to bleach the hair.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.760
Oh, right.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.440
And did it damage their, did they wear gloves?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.160
Did it damage their hands?

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.760
They used to wear the overalls and things.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.640
It's quite interesting really.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.920
How long did she do that for?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.600
Towards the end of the war because as the war ended,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.760
I think things became normal, didn't they?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.520
And they used to have like the prison of war camps in the area.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.000
Yeah.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.600
And quite a lot of Polish people stayed behind

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.040
and married some of the local women.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.000
Oh, oh, right.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.400
So you've got the mixture of the surnames then

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.560
and the Italian prisoner of war as well.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.080
So it's quite a mixture of people when I used to go to school.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.360
Was she very surprised when the soldier arrived at the door

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.880
thanking her for saving his life?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.880
It wasn't her, it was a friend actually.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.200
Right.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.200
But they had a good laugh about it

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.960
and he saw the funny side of things.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.460
Yes.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.600
Amazing that he did it.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.360
So whereabouts did they put these bits of paper on these hand grenades?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.120
I don't know how safe it would have been.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.760
I don't know.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.360
Because I can't, I thought they were just sort of spherical

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.160
and did they put them inside or in the box?

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.440
We might have to look into it, won't we?

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.240
Yes.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.600
Amazing memory.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.400
And did she, did all this stop then at the end of the war?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.040
Yes.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.000
And then came the National Service then, didn't it?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.400
Yes.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.600
And they had a lot of people coming to the area

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.760
because they used to do the training in Transvernay that way.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.160
That's right.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
And isn't that factory still there?

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.000
I don't know if it's still there but it was there for a long long time.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.120
It was, wasn't it?

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.360
And I think there was an explosion once.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.840
Oh right.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.400
If I remember rightly.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.160
So after the war, did your mum then go back to being a housewife

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.240
which was one of the problems, wasn't it?

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.920
The men came back and the women went back to the kitchen.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.920
Well she met my dad then and they got married

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.560
and I think she came of as all-time housewife because there was five of us.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.320
But it's such a wonderful story.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.120
It's lovely to see that you've got these memories really

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.400
when they're not with you anymore.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.680
Yes, I know and she'd be glad to be remembered.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.440
So anything else that you can...

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.080
No, I do remember my uncle, my mum's oldest brother.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.960
He signed up when he was underage.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.600
Wow.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.880
And he went over to Germany.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.240
Did he survive?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.600
He did survive and he got a medal and he never spoke about it.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.200
Only later on and he just died a couple of years ago in his 90s.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.040
Oh and he still didn't speak about it?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.360
No.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.080
Even as some of them as they got older did, didn't they?

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.520
Yeah, he never spoke about it.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.400
No.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.280
Oh gosh.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.280
I remember my mum used to say about my grandfather, my Tide,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.480
that he was gassed during the war, you know,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.120
that's how he died young, he was only in his 30s.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.840
Gosh, so that's your grandfather in the first World War?

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.560
Yes.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.880
Yeah.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.360
Goodness.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.080
Yes, a long line of heroes.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.280
You do remember, don't you?

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.680
Yes.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.680
Oh, it's nice to remember them and that's what remembrance is all about, isn't it?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.200
So thank you, Erin, for coming in.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.880
I'm so pleased to speak to you again.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.840
Thank you.
