00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.340
And one night in the middle of the winter, my father must have smelled smoke and went

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.780
outside and saw the synagogue flame with us in it. So he managed to get all of us out,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:29.560
my mother again pregnant and the baby in arms. And there we could see a group of Nazi youths

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:37.320
with bricks in their hands. They were determined to exterminate us as well as the synagogue.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:52.120
Synagogue went down and in the, whatever it was, with the fires going and people shouting,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:00.760
non-Jewish people got us away. We were in our nightclothes and no shoes and they hid us in

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:12.480
an ice cellar which in those days was a hollowed out hill filled with ice. There was no such thing as

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:28.960
fidgets. We were, these people who lived in the big house put us into the ice cellar when there

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.080
was virtually mass hysteria because they couldn't find us and they wanted to kill us. And we knew

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:43.560
they wanted to kill us. But the rest of the day of that night is complete blank. Actually it was

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:54.440
only four years ago that I saw the ice cellar and I met the daughter of the people who saved us.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:05.600
How did you get, how were you saved? Well as I said, in this mass hysteria they smuggled us away

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:14.760
from the fire and these non-Jewish people and they hid us in the ice cellar. Until the next day,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:25.440
by next day of course the hysteria which when a group of Hitler youths get together, they wind

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:36.040
one another up as we now say. And it's just one hysteric mob and all they wanted to do was kill us.
