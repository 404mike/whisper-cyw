00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
I had discussions with one of the local historians of Resolving some time ago with a view of

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:18.520
one of miners memorial at Resolving. Four miners killed in local pits. When I say local

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:26.160
pits I meant specifically for pits surrounding the Resolving area and nowhere else. And all

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.200
the names on the memorial are from the basically from the Resolving area and some are from

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.800
outside the area but nevertheless they've been killed in local pits. There was a need to get

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:48.040
some detail from the local historian whose name was Mr Billy Downing and he researched the names,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.120
the dates when they were killed and where they were killed. On top of that and he researched

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.840
the production in the various pits that took place at the time. I then as a member of the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.240
Neathborough Council at the time raised the money in conjunction with the Ryan mining. They

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:20.840
financed the program and I can say that the memorial itself when I spoke to Dr Howard

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.960
Francis who is the current member of Parliament for Port Talbot. When I spoke to him some time

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.800
ago he told me that it is the only one of its kind throughout the British coalfield. It's the

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.560
only one of its kind because there are many mining memorials throughout the British coalfield

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:52.000
but for mining disasters not very specific but this one was for specifically for miners who were

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.520
killed in local pits and each name is on there and the dates they were killed. And it was from

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.240
Resolving point of view we're justly proud because it's the only one of its kind throughout the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.840
kingdom.
