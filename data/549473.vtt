00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Datblygu?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000

Mae'n ddod yn dda iawn i'r ymgyrch.

Roedd yn gweithio ar y pwyntiau.

Roedd yn gweithio ar y pwynt,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
a'n gweithio ar y ddwy o bryd,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
a'n gweithio ar y pwynt.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Mae'n dda iawn i'n ddod yn dda iawn i'r pwynt.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Mae'n dda iawn i'r pwynt.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Roedd yn dda iawn i'r pwynt.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Mae'n dda iawn i'r pwynt.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Roedd yn dda iawn i'r berson a realistic texturell.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Mae'n dda iawn i'r berson a realistic Constable.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Mae'n dda iawn i'r berson.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.000
Rydw i'n mynd yn ôl. Gwnaethais chi...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Oedd yn ymwneud ychydig?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Roeddwn yn ymwneud yn Afondale Rhyd yn Gellid, yn y Rhondda.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Rydw i'n mynd yn ôl... a mae gennym ni'r ddau o'ch chi.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Mae gennym ni'r ddau o'ch chi, iawn.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Rydw i'n mynd yn ôl am eich ymgyrch. Gwnaethais chi i ddod o'r ysgol?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Ymgyrch fy mwyn i'n mynd i ddod o'r ysgol.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Roeddwn yn ysgol ar ddwy.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Ond dwi ddim yn gwybod eich amseriau neu eich bod wedi'i ddod o hyd yn ymgyrch.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Ond rwy'n siwr y byddaf yn ymwneud y byddwn yn cael ei ddod o hyd yn ysgol

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
i ddod o hyd yn ysgol o'r ddod o hyd yn ysgol.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Rwy'n siwr y byddwn yn gwybod hynny.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Yna, rydyn ni'n mynd i Pentra.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Yn oed rydw i...

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Roedd wedi bod yn ymgyrch 7.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
A rydyn ni wedi gweithio yn Pentra.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
A rydw i'n mynd i Ysgol Pentra Junior.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Roedd fy 11-plus yn dda o'r un mark.

Yr hyn rydw i'n gwneud yn iawn amdano.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
A rydw i'n mynd i Bronllwyn Secondary Modern.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
A oedd yn Bronllwyn Secondary Modern.

Yn ymgysylltu, yn 15,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000

fel y dydyn nhw'n cael ei ddod o hyd yn ysgol,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
oherwydd nid yw'n rhan o'r Cymru Technicol.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Roeddwn yn ymgyrch Triallol.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Yn ymgyrch Triallol.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Roeddwn yn dda i'r ddod.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Rwy'n credu bod yn rhan o'r un boedd yn mynd i'r ddod hefyd.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Ond roeddwn yn ymgyrch ar ddod y ddod,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
a'i wneud gwaith, teipio,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
yng nghynghori a beth oherwydd.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Mae'n ymgyrch ar ddod y ddod.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
A oedd yn ei ddod ymgyrch ymlaen?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
A o'r hyn byddech chi ddod?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Nid, nid, nid.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Roeddwn yn cael y cyfleoedd yna.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Os dydyn nhw ddod yn ysgol,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
dydyn nhw ddim yn cael y cyfleoedd i ddod o lefelau

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
neu A lefelau neu beth oherwydd yn ystod y ddod.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Mae gennych chi ddod yn eithaf yn eich hapus.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Mae gennych chi ddod yn eithaf yn eithaf yn eithaf yn gwybod.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Roeddwn yn cael ysgol,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
yn gwneud llawer o ddod,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
ond pan oeddwch chi'n 15 a 16,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
dyna byddech chi'n gwneud yr holl ddodau'n ddod, nid?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Ond pan oeddwn yn 17

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
a'n gweithio newydd,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
roeddwn wedi gweithio yn y ffyrdd cyngor ym Mhryhoedd.

Roeddwn wedi cael y cyfleoedd o ddod £3 y ddod,

Roeddwn wedi cael fy marn i fy marn.

Testiwn o dd Acellewconstans

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.560
Un o'r dylion a dwi'n ffyrddol, sy'n byw yn y strwyth nesaf,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.000
roedd hi'n gweithio yn Barnecalfs.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.200
Roedd hi'n dweud i mi bod Mrs Farmer, sy'n gofyn y gwasanaeth,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.400
a'n byw yn ddwy strwythau ystafell,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.800
yn edrych ar unrhyw clac neu'r asistant.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.480
Roedd hi'n dweud,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.880
Go on, off you go, go and knock on Mrs Farmer's door.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.280
I said, I don't know the lady.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.080
Oh yes, she's lovely, go knock on her door.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.280
So I went and I knocked on her door,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.480
and I said, I understand that you're looking for a new assistant,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.680
and I have done some, I got some experience.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.880
And she said, well, come and see me tomorrow,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.480
and I'll do an interview, and we'll see how we go.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.480
And I went along, and she interviewed me,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.080
and she said, right, when can you start?

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:45.680
And I was actually earning, I think about £7.50 a week from £3,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.880
and I couldn't believe my luck to get a job like that.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.680
And it was such a lot of difference in those days.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.480
So can you, were there lots of people in Barnecalfs that you knew?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:11.280
Yes, when I went there, it actually employed,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:18.480
if I explained to you that Polycalfs started up in 1940.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.480
It was started up with, I believe it was Lordenafield,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.880
through the war effort, and originally made uniforms for the troops.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:45.080
It went, and I know that there were records kept from,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.480
it was either 1939 or 1940, and those records were kept

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.280
of people who were actually employed there.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.480
And I mean, I'm talking, I went there 1961,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.280
but those records were still there of people who were employed at that time.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.280
So they had actually, and they were handwritten records,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.480
and they were actually kept.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.880
They then diversified, and they made, let me think now,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.280
they used to do, they still made uniforms,

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:28.280
they made ladies' clothing, they also did bedding.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.080
And I mean, before the factory actually closed,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.880
it was there, it then went into Berberys.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:42.080
That was the way it went, but that was way after I finished,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.280
because it was still Polycalfs when I went there.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.280
They used to make a lot of men's suits and things like that,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.280
and the factory itself was partitioned off into different sections.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:12.280
I, let me think, I went, part of my job every day was to check everybody who,

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.280
every person on the shop floor had to have a clock card.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.280
A clock card.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.280
And throughout the factory there were clocks,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.280
and in the morning when they came into work they clocked in,

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.280
and when they went out in the night or lunchtime, they clocked out.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.280
Now those clock cards and the clocks themselves,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.280
there must have been about ten stations, I would have said, throughout the factory,

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.280
and every day I checked those clock cards,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.280
and I checked them for lateness,

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:58.280
and if someone was not there, then the clock cards were collected in.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:05.280
Even sometimes if there were two reds, which meant that they were late,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.280
they were collected in.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.280
And then to get their clock card the following morning,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.280
they had to come and see either the personnel officer or me,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.280
and they had to tell, they had to give a reasonable explanation as to why they were late,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.280
or why they were absent.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.280
And very often I can remember Mrs Farmer,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.280
who was the personnel officer, telling someone,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.280
well I think it's about time you bought yourself a new alarm clock.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:39.280
You know, it was really quite funny, the things that came out.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.280
What would happen to them if they kept on?

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.280
They would be given a warning,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:53.280
and if they, within a certain period, I can't really remember off hand,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.280
but if it was within a reasonable amount of time,

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.280
and I got a feeling it was a month or six weeks or something like that,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.280
and if they were late so many times, they were given a warning,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.280
and then they were put off, they were made redundant.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.280
If they couldn't give a reasonable explanation then,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.280
because there was a big recruitment drive during that time,

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:31.280
and like I say, you were talking about 1800 girls that the factory employed.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:37.280
Well, not all women, because most of them were pressers,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:43.280
they were men, they were pattern cutters, most of them were men,

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:49.280
and there was a packing department, and that mostly consisted of men.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:56.280
So there were a couple of hundred men, I would have said there, but mostly women.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.280
So 1800 was the number of everybody working there?

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.280
Of everyone working there, yes.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.280
So what percentage would you say were women?

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:15.280
Well, I would have said approximately 75%, three-quarters women,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.280
because the office staff were mostly women as well.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:25.280
The managers were men, as they would be, but most of the office staff,

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:32.280
and I can actually remember someone being taken on as a manager who was a woman,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:39.280
and she was in the design department and of the bedding section,

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.280
but that was very unusual, especially in those days,

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:53.280
because women became supervisors, the foremen were usually men.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.280
It was accepted practice in those days, wasn't it?

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:03.280
Women didn't really climb up the ladder, because they didn't get the chance.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.280
Pretty low class ceiling, wasn't it?

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.280
Yes, very low class.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:17.280
Oh great. Tell me then about the first day you entered the factory.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.280
Can you remember what it was like?

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:24.280
Did you go straight on? I mean, did you go in the first few times you went there,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.280
did you go on the factory floor?

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.280
Yes, well now the girl whose job I was taking over was leaving to have a baby,

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:38.280
so she was with me for two weeks, so she actually trained me, taught me all the job,

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:46.280
and then on the following week it was, we are off you go, you're on your own,

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:52.280
but I suppose it's one of those things you accepted and you fell into then, wasn't it?

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.280
You learnt as you went along, and a lot of it is experience as well.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.280
And Mrs Farmer was a wonderful boss, she really was wonderful.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:10.280
A lady who never had any children of her own, but was kind,

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:18.280
and she was known to be a very fair manager then as such,

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.280
because if any of the factory managers said anything about the girls,

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.280
she would have them up and she'd say,

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.280
now you tell me your side of the story before anything was ever done.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:36.280
And she taught me a lot I think, you know, over the years, it was quite surprising.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.280
But while I was there...

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.280
Sorry, did the girls on the floor, they found her fair as well?

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.280
Oh very fair, oh yes, yes.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.280
How did you get on with the girls on the floor?

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:59.280
Well, mind, one of the funnies which I always remember was we had two nurses,

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.280
one was the sister and one was the nurse.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:08.280
I was trying to remember, I think they were both, one was nursery's and one was sister's,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:15.280
they both had the same surname, and the nurse was very little,

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.280
but she was a bossy boot, she was.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:29.280
And throughout the middle of the factory, which was a very big building as such, were the toilets.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.280
Now the girls every day, they weren't allowed to smoke on the factory floor,

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:40.280
but they were allowed to smoke in the toilets, so a lot of them would have a break,

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.280
and she would say to me, right, come on, off we go.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.280
Oh yes, what have I got to go to?

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.280
You've got to come with these girls now and tell them to go downstairs, they've had enough.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:16:00.280
So we'd be upstairs now and it was a whole area that you could walk through, very big,

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:07.280
and you'd see the girls and they'd be scuttling now, and they'd be saying, oh, the nurse is coming.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:14.280
You can imagine, and there'd be rummlers in their hair, or somebody would be doing their nails,

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.280
and they'd all be scuttering then.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:24.280
And she'd say, you've got to tell them as well, and I used to go, oh, no nurse, not today.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:32.280
And I'd be behind her and I was a lot taller, and I'd be making eyes at the girls and they'd all be scuttering.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:39.280
But yes, I got on quite well with them.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:50.280
It was a different relationship in that quite often I was interviewing some of these girls first thing in the morning

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:59.280
because when Mrs Farmer, she became ill and she left me to do an awful lot of the things,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.280
and I actually took charge of the office for about six months because she was ill

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.280
and I was just running the office as such.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:19.280
So you can't discipline people and be best friends with them as well, can you? It's very difficult.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:28.280
But I was friendly with some of them, and like I say, I'm still friends with them today,

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:34.280
so it's fine. The two friends that I have that I'm very friendly with now,

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:40.280
I didn't actually know them that well when I worked in Palychof.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.280
And they worked on the floor.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.280
Yes.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.280
So did you find it hard to discipline people?

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.280
Very hard because I was only young myself, wasn't I?

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:59.280
But when you have a manager standing behind you that tells you that you've got to do it,

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.280
because what they used to do then was they knew that I was a bit inexperienced,

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:09.280
so they'd come along and they'd stand behind me, but it was I who had to do the discipline.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:16.280
But you accept it as part of the job and you move on then, don't you?

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.280
I do.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:27.280
Describe to me, you've told me about, so you spent quite a bit of time on the factory floor.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.280
Yes, I did, yes.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:35.280
Describe to me physically now what it was like, what it looked like, what it smelled like,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.280
what the ambience was like.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.280
I wouldn't say that there were any particular smells,

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:52.280
but each area had its own ambience, I suppose you would call it.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.280
I was quite friendly with one of the clerks in the packing department,

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:03.280
so I used to spend some time and say good morning to a friend in the packing department.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.280
That was where the men worked and that was where everything was packed

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.280
and went out of the factory.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:17.280
Then you went further in and there were men who, mostly men, who did pressing.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:24.280
There was then a small department where there were ladies and they did hand sewing.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:34.280
And then there were the big, long aisles where the sewing machines were

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:42.280
and each one did, some of them were trousers, some of them were jackets,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.280
some of them, there was a pattern department.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:55.280
So everything was sectioned out basically.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:06.280
The bedding department then went to a small factory

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:17.280
because they felt that there was more involved, bigger machines,

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:23.280
because they had big machines, and everything was done on a machine then.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:37.280
They were machine embroidering on duvets and bed covers and things like that.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.280
So where was that factory then?

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.280
That was alongside, but it was completely separate.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.280
There was a manager run just that department then.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.280
So did that mean that the factory got even bigger?

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.280
Yes, I think it did.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.280
They took more people on?

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.280
Yes. And there was a canteen and a very big canteen.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:12.280
I remember the canteen manager.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:19.280
I had a friend who worked as a cook in the canteen department

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:26.280
and I also remember they used to make beautiful cakes, these pineapple cakes,

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.280
and I've never ever tasted any pineapple cakes like those.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.280
They were absolutely beautiful.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.280
It's that kind of thing I think that you remember, isn't it?

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:43.280
Talking about the canteen then, did everybody use the same canteen?

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.280
Yes. Let me think now.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.280
There was a small part of it where the managers went,

00:21:53.280 --> 00:22:02.280
but it was a really big canteen because they didn't stagger the lunch hour.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:13.280
Everyone had a whole hour for lunch, so you had from 12 to 1 every day.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:25.280
In the mornings there were approximately 40 buses that used to come into the factory to bring the people in.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:32.280
At lunchtime there would be some buses because obviously if they were living further away they couldn't get there and back.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:42.280
But there were a certain amount of buses that went as far as, I believe it was Astor and that kind of thing that they knew was accessible.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:50.280
Sometimes I would go home and have lunch and then come back on a factory bus.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.280
Those buses were free.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:23:05.280
Did they segregate in the canteen? Did everybody sit together except for the managers, you said?

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:12.280
There were tables and quite long tables, but I suppose it's like everything else.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:23.280
If I sat, I sat with the girls from the offices because you sat with your friends and that was the way it worked, wasn't it?

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.280
You mixed, but only to a certain extent.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:36.280
We used to play cards a lot in those days and play for money on a lunch time.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:44.280
I can vividly remember that and there would be quite big arguments too if you weren't careful.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:50.280
So what was the price of the food like? Was it reasonable?

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.280
It was very reasonable.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.280
Was it subsidised, do you think?

00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:03.280
No, I don't think it was subsidised. I never understood it to be subsidised.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:09.280
Did you still eat there most days, would you say?

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:14.280
Occasionally rather than most days.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.280
Occasionally.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:29.280
But then when I went there, like I say, it was about 1961, that canteen was used for a lot of things.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:38.280
They used to have dances and things like that and the dances were held in the canteen.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:58.280
They used to do, I remember there was workers playtime and they came there and they used to have entertainment and things even on a lunchtime for the workers.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.280
Who arranged that then?

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:10.280
I believe that it was the canteen manager who did all that. He arranged that.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:16.280
I can't ever remember anyone else saying that they had any hand in that.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:24.280
So it wasn't arranged by the factories then, was it? Was it encouraged by the factories?

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.280
Encouraged by the factories.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.280
But not arranged by them?

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:42.280
Well, Mr Lawrence was a manager within the factory so quite probably when I think about it, possibly the food may have been subsidised to a certain extent as well.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.280
Maybe not run at a profit even.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:51.280
Because that I suppose was one of the things that you would look at if it was today.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.280
Today they don't do anything unless there's profit involved do they?

00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.280
But it certainly wasn't done for profit I don't think in those days.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:09.280
I can't remember anyone ever saying anything about the canteen making money then as such.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:16.280
Because all of the staff and everything else that were in the canteen were employed by the factory.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.280
So, yes.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:25.280
What about parties and Christmas do's?

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.280
Oh, parties yes, Christmas do's yes.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:44.280
Now, the day the factory finished, the girls were always, they always finished on a lunch, well the factory finished on a lunch time.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:51.280
And I used to be quite gutted actually because they all used to go for lunch.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:27:02.280
But they would never pay anyone their pay for them to go to lunch.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.280
They had to come back by, I think it was either four o'clock or five o'clock.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:15.280
And they were handed, I mean in those days you didn't get money paid into the bank, you had a pay packet didn't you?

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:23.280
And everyone was given their pay packets when they came back in to fetch their pay.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.280
If they didn't come back, they didn't have their pay.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.280
It was kept then until after the holidays.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:40.280
But, and you can imagine a lot of those girls were really, really the worst for wear.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:48.280
And you can imagine that I can still see a lot of women and a few men.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:53.280
And those poor men running for their lives down the factory because the women were saying,

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.280
I want to come back here and I want to give you a Christmas kiss.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.280
You can just imagine that can't you?

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:08.280
But for myself, I used to have to then, when everyone had clocked out,

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:15.280
I would have to go and collect all the clock cards throughout the factory and sort them,

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:21.280
put them in number order and then book in whether they were late,

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.280
if they'd been sick or whatever for that week.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:37.280
And I was never, I was always the last one in the factory because it was something that I had to do before I was allowed to finish.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.280
On Christmas Eve.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.280
On Christmas Eve.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.280
So they did the wages then, on Christmas Eve did they?

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.280
Usually, yes.

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.280
And were you involved in doing the wages?

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.280
No, I wasn't.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.280
But you were involved in the hours and stuff like that?

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.280
Yes, yes, yes.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:29:01.280
And all the clock cards then that I had assembled and they were assembled, I think in numerical order,

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:12.280
but I would put them into bands and they went to, I think there were about eight, six or eight girls

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.280
in the wages department who worked out all the wages.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:29.280
And the four men then, or the supervisors as such, would go and fetch their department's wages and pay them out.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:35.280
So there was a handful of them and you couldn't enjoy them.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.280
Where would they go then?

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.280
They'd go to the pubs.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.280
The pubs.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.280
The pubs and they'd all go out for lunch.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.280
Yes.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.280
Yes.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.280
In the day.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.280
Yes, it was either Christmas Eve or the day before maybe.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:58.280
I can't, I think it must have been about the Christmas Eve because they didn't in those days give you that much time off on a Christmas time, did they?

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:07.280
It would be like Christmas Eve, Boxing Day perhaps, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, anywhere back the following day.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.280
What about, did they have a Christmas do anywhere then? Did you have a Christmas do?

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:20.280
Yes, we used to, they used to have a lot more in the factory than the girls in the offices ever did.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:35.280
But we did have Christmas dos and this photograph that I've got here is actually a Christmas do that was organised and was within the canteen.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:51.280
But we also, I believe it was through the union because I know they were really involved in setting up a social club.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:31:04.280
And this social club then was set up in, they bought an old vicarage and I was actually involved in doing a lot of the typing and things when the property was bought.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:19.280
And I can remember being quite involved in that and I was allowed to go and do the typing for that because Mrs Farmer said that I was allowed.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.280
Yes.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.280
You know.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.280
Well we'll talk about that later on.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.280
Yes, right.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.280
Because I know you've got more to say about that as well.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.280
Yes.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.280
I'll say, I'll say.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.280
Now, what about the noise on the factory floor?

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.280
Do you remember that?

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.280
Noise, yes.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.280
Was it noisy?

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.280
Yes, quite noisy.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.280
Yes.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:32:01.280
Noisy in that, but not loud noisy, but possibly more when the machines were going and the people were chattering.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.280
They were allowed to talk.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:12.280
And there was also, there was a tannoy system and there was always music being played on the tannoy system.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:18.280
Yes, and nobody was ever stopped from talking because.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.280
Did people used to sing as well?

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.280
Oh yes.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.280
Did you join in the singing?

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.280
Oh no.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.280
Oh definitely not.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.280
Why is that?

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.280
Because you were off your stuff or because.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.280
Oh no, because I can't sing.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:48.280
Yes, quite, yes, they did used to sing, but I can't ever remember anyone having a wonderful voice anyway, but you would have a little chuckle as you passed them and they were singing.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:33:04.280
But it was quite noisy and I don't think that because of the tannoy system and things going as well, I don't think that they talked more than they sang.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.280
I think that was the way it went.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.280
So it used to do these clocks.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.280
What else did your working day entail of?

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.280
I know you used to do the pick up the clocks and stuff like that.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:21.280
Yes, yes, well I would type letters.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.280
I would.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:32.280
Let me see.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:45.280
I checked references, I interviewed late comers, I kept records for, there was a record card kept for each and every person who was employed.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.280
So what was on the record card then?

00:33:48.280 --> 00:34:13.280
There was an entry as to when they were employed, what they were doing, where they worked, if they were lit, if they'd been reprimanded, there were all sorts of things and it was like an envelope then.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.280
And if there was anything that needed to be kept, it was tucked into the envelope.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:28.280
They checked references because very often girls would say, oh they were experienced and of course if they were experienced they got a better wage.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:36.280
And then you'd check their references and if they weren't right, then their pay was knocked down.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.280
So that was quite important.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:50.280
Did you have to dismiss anybody yourself ever?

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.280
Yes, yes, a few times.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.280
How did you feel about that?

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:02.280
Well, not good.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:15.280
Sometimes I felt that they were rather silly and I didn't feel responsible because it was their life that they were being silly about.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:24.280
I vividly remember one particular girl who was employed in the office and she was actually stealing from other girls.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:37.280
And you don't feel sorry for someone like that, you just feel that it's rather sad that they've come from a tidy home and things and they've still got to steal from friends.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:44.280
That's just one of the facts of life, isn't it?

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:49.280
So were you involved in writing references for people as well when they went to their employment?

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.280
Yes, yes.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:36:09.280
More, I suppose, a pro-former type of thing and Mrs Farmer then would dictate letters to me and then as I got more experienced I would just do it myself type of thing because I knew what to do.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:16.280
Because like I say it was more of a pro-former, they were employed and they were good workers and whatever.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.280
You just go down that road then, don't you?

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:29.280
Was there anything that you did that you were really sorry you had to do over the years?

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:35.280
I wouldn't say sorry but quite frightened about.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:44.280
I was asked or I was told by Mrs Farmer, we did sick visiting.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.280
So we would go out sick visiting.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:37:01.280
I'd get the chauffeur to take me so I'd be off in the best car.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.280
So who were you visiting on it?

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.280
The employees.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.280
Who were sick?

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:22.280
There was one, once, twice, two particular people that I went to visit and one of them was in the mental hospital in Bridgend.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:31.280
I was taking flowers and fruit for these people and they'd been off quite a while.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:39.280
But I can always remember going to the mental hospital.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:46.280
Never ever been anywhere like that before because I was after all only 19, 20 years of age.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:59.280
And being locked in a, well not so much locked in a room, but between each set of doors you went through,

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:06.280
you were locked in and seeing all these people all down the corridor.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:14.280
And I was on my own and the blinking chauffeur said, no you're on your own, I'm not coming in there with you.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.280
And I said gee thanks, you know.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:25.280
But I just, I didn't feel, well yes I was quite frightened I suppose at the time.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:31.280
But I'm very glad to come out of there and felt so sad for the person that was there.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:38.280
And I don't think, I went a second time, I think it may have been to see the same lady,

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.280
but I don't think she ever came back to work.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:56.280
Sad, we had very big floods in parts of the Rhondda when I was working.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:05.280
And we got heavily involved in helping a lot of our people because they were,

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:11.280
like we've had now recently, they were flooded out.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:23.280
And we had, I think I remember helping to make up parcels of food and everything else,

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:28.280
which was brought into the factory with the canteen.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:36.280
And all these parcels of food were made up and taking them out to the people who had been flooded out,

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:42.280
that was hard, you know, because you feel you want to help people more

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.280
and you can't do more for one than you can for another then.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.280
That I found quite hard.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:58.280
Did that idea come from the top or from the management?

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.280
You know, this idea of, it sounds like quite a philanthropic thing.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:16.280
Yes, I would have said it was quite probably from Mrs Farmer herself because she went to chapel.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:23.280
She was quite a caring woman.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:34.280
And yes, I suppose most of the managers and things and a lot of the girls on the factory floor,

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:39.280
and I do believe that they collected money and things for these people as well,

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:43.280
which was divided up and handed out.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:50.280
Maybe it wasn't a lot, but it helped pay their wages because a lot of them couldn't come to work.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:55.280
So it came from the workers and managers rather than from the bosses?

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:06.280
Yes, quite possibly, but then it was, as far as I was aware, it was the managing director and that was the top.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:15.280
As far as I was aware, there was no, I don't ever remember there being a fuss about owners coming around.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.280
It was the managing director and he was the boss.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.280
And who did you say that was?

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.280
He was a Mr Taylor.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.280
And he was a very nice man.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.280
Did he live locally?

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:36.280
I believe he lived in the Vale somewhere, but I can't remember anything else of that.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:47.280
So do you think Polycov's was a good company to work for then?

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.280
In the early days, yes, I suppose they were.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:42:03.280
They looked after the welfare very much of the girls because there was a surgery.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:16.280
The doctor came a couple of times a week, so if the girls had any problems, the doctor was there, so they didn't have to go to the surgery.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:38.280
What I particularly remember is when the smallpox outbreak was in the Rhondda, the factory, because there was an awful lot of worry within the valleys at that time,

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:46.280
because of course some of these people who had the smallpox were put into a hospital within the Rhondda.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.280
Do you remember when that was?

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.280
Yes, 1961.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:43:05.280
They organised for everyone who wanted an immunisation against smallpox to come and have it done within the factory.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:11.280
I was involved in doing these smallpox injections.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:18.280
I can't remember, I think I was sticking plasters on everyone and helping.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:23.280
The sister was doing one lot, the doctor was doing the other lot.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:30.280
I remember the nurse's name now, her name was Nurse Howells.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.280
I was saying to everybody, stop flapping!

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:44.280
I can also remember some of the girls, I can't have an injection like that in my arm, I have to have it in my leg.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.280
People fainted.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:55.280
You can imagine all this excitement because everyone had to leave their jobs and then come and coo and get these injections.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:02.280
Records had to be kept as well because they had to make sure that they didn't give them to some of them twice,

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.280
because some of them would have had it twice if they could.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.280
Anything for free!

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.280
So that was all done in the factory?

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.280
That was done within the factory.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.280
So that was a huge procreate camp?

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.280
Yes, it was.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.280
It took a lot of organisation.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:37.280
We also had a problem with TB at one particular point.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:45.280
I had a particular friend who worked in the factory and she hadn't been very well.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:55.280
I went to the doctors and I remember saying to Mrs Farmer about it and she said,

00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:03.280
I wonder if we can see if we can get the x-ray to do the TB here?

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.280
Which they did.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:13.280
Everyone got an x-ray, most of the people within the factory.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:18.280
So that was a big organisational thing as well.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:28.280
It was found that we had, I think, about two dozen girls with TB.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:37.280
Some of those girls actually were in hospital for quite a long time.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.280
My friend was in hospital for quite a long time.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:49.280
It was just at the beginning when they used to give penicillin for TB.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:54.280
But they used to still keep them in hospital for quite a long time.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:46:06.280
It was quite a problem and I remember going and taking fruit and flowers and things for quite a few of these girls.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.280
So they wouldn't have known already about this problem?

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.280
No, they wouldn't have.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.280
So were they all okay?

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:17.280
Yes, well, I don't remember anyone dying.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:25.280
But one friend that I have, that I'm very friendly with in the village,

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:34.280
she is actually one of the girls who was in hospital and I know that Jane was in hospital for six months.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:39.280
And they were some day longer.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.280
Did polycops keep the jobs open for them?

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:50.280
Yes, they did. Yes, yes, yes. Most of the time, yes.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:56.280
What would happen with sick pay in those days? Do you remember?

00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:01.280
No sick pay. No sick pay.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:09.280
No sick pay. I got sick pay. I got sick pay, but I couldn't tell you what.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.280
But there wasn't any sick pay for people on the factory floor?

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.280
No sick pay for the people on the factory floor.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:20.280
Why do you think there was a, why did they differentiate, do you think?

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:33.280
I don't know, maybe because it was, it would have been a very expensive outlay.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:41.280
And maybe the factory didn't run on that kind of off scale, I don't know.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.280
It was accepted practice, wasn't it, in those days?

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:53.280
No, the managers got sick pay and things, I'm positive of that.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:48:00.280
But I can't actually remember, as far as I was concerned, being ill.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:10.280
Because when you're young, most of the time anyway, in touch with, you're not ill as you are when you get older, are you?

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:17.280
But no, I don't remember anyone getting sick pay as such.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:23.280
What was the position of, you know, did you get sick pay from the government?

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.280
I can't remember.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.280
Well, you had National Insurance, didn't you?

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.280
Yeah.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:42.280
Because when you were pregnant, you got 11 weeks maternity pay.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.280
But not from the company?

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.280
But not from the company, no.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.280
Right.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:49:01.280
No, and as with today, they keep your job open and they pay you maternity pay and things within the way you're working.

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.280
But in those days they didn't.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:09.280
It was what you, the maternity pay you had was from the government and that was it.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:15.280
Were you aware of the differential in pay between men and women in the factory?

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.280
Oh, definitely. Oh, definitely the men were paid.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:26.280
And there'd be perhaps women working alongside the men and they would be paid less.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.280
Do you know how much less?

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:33.280
No, not off the top of my head. I couldn't know. But I know they were paid less.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:38.280
Do you know what happened when, were you there when the Equal Pay Act came?

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:41.280
No, no, that was 1975, wasn't it?

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.280
1970.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.280
Was it 70?

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:50.280
No, no, no, because I finished in 1964.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.280
1964.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:56.280
OK. And what was I going to say? Right, you told them about the union.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.280
Now, there was an union in, they were members of the union.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.280
Yes, a very strong union, yes.

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.280
Garment Workers?

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.280
Garment Workers Union, yes.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.280
And were you a member of the union?

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.280
No.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.280
You didn't have an office union?

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.280
No, no, no office union.

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.280
How did you feel about that?

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.280
Never even thought about it.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:25.280
It wasn't even suggested, I suppose, in those days. It was just accepted practice.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.280
If you worked in an office, you didn't belong to a union.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:37.280
I had quite a lot of dealings with the union, obviously, through the girls on the factory floor.

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:42.280
And always there was a...

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:45.280
How did those dealings go?

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:54.280
Always well. They were always reasonable, because I think, especially with Mrs Farmer, she was...

00:50:54.280 --> 00:51:03.280
Obviously, they disagreed on some things, but she was a reasonable person.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:10.280
And her outlook was that she always tried to come down on the side of the girls.

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:16.280
That if there was any way that she could keep them, that she possibly could, she would.

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:21.280
She wasn't a higher of fire.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:29.280
And I think when you've got as many people involved within a large factory like that,

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:33.280
it takes all sorts, doesn't it?

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:39.280
So there are some people, and you've got different kinds of problems that you have to deal with,

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:49.280
where some people have personal problems that they smell, and then people come and say they're not working with them because they smell in.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.280
And that kind of thing.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.280
And how do you deal with that kind of problem, which can be very difficult?

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.280
Because you can't very well say, look, you are using a balsorb.

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.280
You're going to have a wash, can you?

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:07.280
It can be very difficult to deal with that kind of problem.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:12.280
Did anybody come to you with personal problems?

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:15.280
Yes, very often.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.280
So you and Mrs Farmer?

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.280
Yes.

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.280
And you could help to sort them out, could you?

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.280
Well, if you possibly could, you would.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.280
So you'd say there was a good relationship between?

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.280
Oh, very good.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:37.280
Well, I suppose you couldn't solve everyone's problems, but you tried to help as much as you possibly could.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.280
Yes.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.280
Were there any disputes when you were there?

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.280
Strikes, yes.

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:57.280
How did you deal with those? Did you have to deal with things like that?

00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:06.280
I don't know. I've got to think about that.

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:13.280
So do you remember any disputes?

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.280
Yes, I do remember disputes.

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:23.280
I remember parts of the factory being on strike.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:36.280
Quite possibly, I remember the pressers, which was the men, going on strike because they wanted more money.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:46.280
They weren't being paid enough and they were paid a lot by the hour.

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.280
They were paid.

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:56.280
Whereas there was a time and motion department within the factory,

00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:08.280
which employed, I think, about three people who timed everything that everyone did within the factory.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:20.280
But I do remember the pressers going on strike and the union being involved.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:27.280
The personnel officer, Mrs Farmer, being employed within that.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:32.280
But it would be more down to the managers on the factory floor.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:48.280
I think she would only sit in as an observer rather than perhaps sorting and smoothing things over.

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:55.280
Smoothing things over and helping rather than being involved in any of the disputes as such.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:55:02.280
I don't think I ever remember her doing anything.

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:11.280
Maybe I'm wrong, but not that I can remember being involved in anything like that.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:23.280
Was there any unpleasant feeling about it when these disputes would happen between, say, office and floor or management and floor?

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:38.280
There were sometimes disputes more, I think, as far as perhaps the wages department were concerned in the office.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:50.280
We would perhaps sort out problems if someone had a dispute as far as their wages were concerned.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:56.280
They'd come to us and they'd say, well, I haven't had enough pay.

00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:07.280
Then we'd sit down with them and work it out and say, well, right, okay, tell us what's going on and show us what you think and what you've got.

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:13.280
We'd sort it out and work it from there and then go to the wages department.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:21.280
There was a woman in charge of the wages department who would sort it out from there.

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:26.280
But that's the kind of situation that we got involved in.

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.280
So not an industrial dispute?

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:33.280
Not an industrial dispute as such, no.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:40.280
Do you remember any trips when you were at Polychrist?

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:48.280
Yes, I do remember going on a trip to London and a whole train full of people.

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:54.280
They used to commandeer a train and the train would go off to London.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:58.280
I think I went about twice.

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:01.280
So where would this train start from?

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:17.280
It would start from Triochi, pick people up then all the way down the valleys and when you got to London you went your own way and the train would return at a certain time that evening.

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:23.280
And a whole train full of people.

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.280
I remember that.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:29.280
So who would sort of book the train? Do you remember?

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:34.280
No, not at all. I wasn't involved in anything like that.

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.280
I wouldn't remember.

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:52.280
I would imagine, because there was a social department, social events department within, I think it was under Mr Lawrence in the canteen.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:58:03.280
I think I remember a department and they used to organise the dances and things like that as well, the trips to London. Yes, I do remember that.

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:08.280
So what did you do in London? You said you all went your own way.

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:29.280
I've actually got, and like I say, when my husband comes back I put my hands on it, I've got a photograph standing in Trafalgar Square with some other girls who weren't working in Polycops.

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:39.280
But I'm sure it was on the trip with Polycops, standing with my hands feeding the birds.

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:47.280
Perhaps going and seeing a show, but I can't remember doing much else.

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:53.280
So it wasn't just Polycops employees that were there?

00:58:53.280 --> 00:59:00.280
No, you could invite friends and things as well.

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.280
Did those happen quite often?

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:07.280
Once a year, it was only a once a year trip.

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.280
Always to London or to other places?

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:20.280
No, I can't remember. Perhaps the other women might remember, but I can't remember going anywhere other than London.

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:27.280
Was that fairly, did you pay for those or did they pay for them?

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:31.280
I must have paid for it.

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:39.280
Or did we get it cheap or did we get it free? I can't remember.

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:42.280
I can't remember.

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:47.280
Anyway, you were telling me about the social club.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:50.280
The social club, yes.

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.280
It was called the Polycops Social Club.

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:58.280
I actually met my husband there.

00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:10.280
We used to go along and they used to do, it was quite a big social club.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:19.280
There was an entertainment room where I had gone with a friend.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.280
We were quite a few women friends, girls.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:29.280
This young boy was in those days.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:35.280
He came and asked me, could he take me home because there were lions around that night.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.280
I fell for it.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.280
Here I am 51 years later still married to him.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:55.280
Like I say, we had part of our reception when we got married.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.280
We all went back to the social club after we were married.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:04.280
I think that was quite accepted in those days.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.280
All the entertainment and things.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:12.280
It was all homegrown entertainment because everybody sang.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:18.280
You made your own entertainment then you didn't employ bands or anything else, did you?

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:23.280
Everyone had a good time. You enjoyed it.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.280
Was that in the chapel that was brought in?

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:34.280
It was a vicarage.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.280
What happened to it?

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:41.280
The vicarage is still there but it's more or less derelict now.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:48.280
It was way before Polycops finished.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:58.280
I think they may have sold it even because it was actually owned by the people.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:05.280
I'm sure it was because in those days the girls used to give to the social club.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.280
They paid out of their wages.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.280
We all did.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:25.280
When we went to London, the social club paid for that trip because we were paying out of our wages for that.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:31.280
Originally the premises were bought.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.280
I believe they had a mortgage and whatever.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:41.280
But it was paid out of the wages of the people within the factory.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:57.280
What was the proportion of single women and married women who worked?

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.280
Were there a lot of married women working?

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.280
There were quite a lot of married women, yes.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.280
My sister-in-law worked there for many years.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.280
When you got pregnant, your job wasn't kept open for you.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.280
You weren't paid maternity pay or anything in those days so you had to finish.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:30.280
But if you wanted to go back to work then and there was a job there, then they would give you a job.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.280
It could quite possibly not be something that you'd done before.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:43.280
But so long as you were a machinist, you were offered the job.

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:55.280
But there was also a training department within the factory run by a lady called Kate, a single lady.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:04.280
She trained all of the girls who came in to school, 15-year-olds.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:09.280
She handled all those girls.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.280
She handled it with a rod of iron.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.280
They had to listen to what they were told.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.280
Because of course it could be quite dangerous.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:26.280
If you had a friend, as he was saying this Saturday because we were talking about it,

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:31.280
she said you weren't classed as a machinist until you'd had a needle in your finger.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:42.280
But yes, it was quite surprising how it was run.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:51.280

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.760
Fel mae'r holl fyrwyd yn ei wneud.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.800
Roeddech chi'n siarad, roeddech chi'n mynd i Cardiff.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.120
Fath oedd yn dda.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.760
Roeddech chi'n cael unrhyw beth o poliwchost?

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.160
A oes gennych o bwydau neu perchiadau?

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:53.400
Roeddech chi'n cael llawer o ffyrdd o bobl fwyaf yn ystod yna.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:59.920
Mae'n bwysig yn fy dydd, roeddech chi'n cael siŵr mhen a'r uniformau a phethau fel hynny.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.760
Dwi ddim yn gallu ei roeddech chi'n gwneud...

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.760
Rwy'n meddwl, yn ystod yna, fe wnaethon nhw'n gwneud cwtau'r llesau a phethau fel hynny.

Roeddech chi'n ddigon oherwydd roeddech chi'n...

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:23.760
Felly pan fyddwch chi'n dda, a fyddwch chi ddim yn cael llawer o ffyrdd,

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:27.360
ond dyna fyddwch chi ddim yn cael llawer o ffyrdd sy'n mynd i chi.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.360
Yn ogystal â pos.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.640
Felly fe wnaethon chi dda clos, a fyddwch chi'n cael recordau a phethau fel hynny?

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:39.640
O recordau, oherwydd, oherwydd, yn ogystal â...

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:43.640

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:49.640
A oeddwch chi'n gadael llawer o fynd i'r ddau?

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.640
Ie, gallwn ni gyd yn oed yn ymwneud â Cardiff,

Yn y Cardiff, yn y capita.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.640
Yn y capita.

Ie, a Billy Furey.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.640

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.640
O, a allan?

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.640
Dwi ddim yn credu bod yn gweld Cliff Richards.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.640
Ond, ond, llawer o ffordd o ffordd o ffordd.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:25.640
A rwy'n hoffi, yn ogystal â...

a gael unrhyw ddau a phethau, a oedd yn y ddau hynny'n ddaeth.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.640
Mae'n ddaeth yn ddaeth.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.640
Oherwydd, a oedd yn oed yn ymwneud â'r cyffredin,

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.640
a'i ddod yn fy mhaid i'r Cardiff.

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.640
Wel, nid oedd fy mhaid i'r ddau hynny, unrhyw ddau.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.640
A roedd yn dweud,

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.640

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.640
Dwi ddim wedi cwch unrhyw ddau.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.640
Yn y ddyddiau,

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.640
mae pobl heddiw ddim yn meddwl am ddau fel hyn ydw i heddiw,

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.640
ond rydym wedi byw drwy y eraffedd gwahanol yna.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.640
A ydych chi...

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.640
A ydych chi'n teimlo gyda...

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.640
A ydych chi'n teimlo gyda phobl sy'n gweithio gyda?

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.640
Ie, rwyf.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.640
O'r ddau o'r ddau neu o'r ddau?

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.640
Nid oedd unrhyw ddau o'r ddau,

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.640
rwyf yn ddweud i bobl ar y rhai oed,

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.640

Wel, y ddau sy'n gweithio yn y ddau ymgyrch,

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.640
Rydyn ni'n fawr iawn.

Felly, yw, yn y sens, rydym yn dda i'n fawr iawn.

Yr unrhyw ddau syddwn i'n gwybod o'r flwyddyn ffactor,

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.640

pan fyddant yn gweithio ar y flwyddyn ffactor fel rydw i'n gwybod.

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.640
Y ddau o'r flwyddyn yn ddweud am y cameradau...

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.640
Y ddau o'r flwyddyn ffactor.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.640
Roedd yn dda i'n gwybod yn y same?

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.640
Mae'r ffactor yn dda o'r ddau,

yn dda, yn dda, yn dda, yn dda, yn dda, yn dda.

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:24.640
Roedd y ddau yn dda i'r ddau ymgyrch yng nghymru yno.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.640
Ond roedd gennym ni ddwy ffactor yn dda,

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:32.640
a phan o'n gweithio ar ei hunain.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:41.640
Roedd y ffactor yma'n dda i'r ffactor,

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.640
a phan o'r ddau yma.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:51.640
Roedd unrhyw ddau o'r ddau o'r ddau o'r ffactor,

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.640

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.640
A ni ddu i gyd yn y ffactor,

ac roeddwn ni'n cael llawer o ffactor cymorth yng nghymru.

Ond, yn fwy, yn fwy, ond ni'n dda i gyd,

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.640
oherwydd roeddwn ni'n gweithio ar ein hunain.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.640
Felly roeddwn ni'n gweithio o weithio.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.640
Roeddwn ni'n gweithio o weithio, iawn.

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.640
Ond, fyddaf,

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.640
roeddwn ni'n mynd i'r ffactor yma,

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.640

fel y byddwn yn mynd i'r ffactor ar y ddau,

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.640

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.640
Ond, oherwydd,

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.640
oherwydd,

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.640
yn bwysig,

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.640
y gwasanaeth ymgyrch.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:58.640
Roeddwn ni'n mynd i'r ffactor a'i gweithio'n fwy.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.640
Roeddwn i'n mynd i chi ddweud,

Ah, nid yw hyn.

Pan ddodais i,

ac roedd nhw ddim yn dweud i ddodio ar 6 o'r mori.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.640
Felly roedd y ffactor yn dda iawn,

ond, wrth gwrs,

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.640

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:18.960
I finished work then and when we moved away, we moved to Coventry and then we moved back and lived in Neath.

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:31.960
I went and did some extra training and went and had a job with the police and worked for the police as a clerk in the police for about 15 years, 16 years with the police.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:39.960
Yn ymwneud â mi, oes gennych chi'n edrych ar y pethau yma o'r holl fath o'r ddod yn y ffatri?

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:54.960

A'n dweud, nes i mi, rydym yn ôl i mi yn y ffordd.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.960
Nes i mi, rydym yn cael fy mod yn y ffordd yma, yn fy hun.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.960
Rydw i'n meddwl, heddiw,

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.960
mae'r bobl bobl nid oes angen i ni ddod oherwydd hynny,

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.960
yn y ffordd, ond dyna'r ffordd yma oedd yn y dyddiau hwnnw.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:25.960
Rydw i'n meddwl, rwy'n gallu'n ddod o'r amser,

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:30.960
roedd hi'n cael ffrindio'r bobl yn y ffordd yma

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.960
ac yna rydych chi'n gweithio'r bobl yn y ffordd

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.960
ac roedden nhw'n dechrau, a oedd hi'n ymwneud â chi'n ymwneud â ni'n dda?

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.960
Oherwydd roedden nhw'n gwybod beth yw'n mynd i ni

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.960
ac roedd hi'n mynd i un o'r bobl o'r ffordd yma.

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.960
Roedd hi'n manawr.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.960
Rydw i'n meddwl, mae'r hyn o bryd yn oed yn oed yn oed, yw'n hynny?

01:18:53.960 --> 01:19:00.960
A oedd hi'n bach o'r arasmyn, oherwydd yw'r hyn o bach o'r ffordd yma?

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:04.960
A oedd oedd yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed, y penderfyniadau'r bobl?

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:11.960
Rydw i'n meddwl bod'r bobl yn ei fwyaf pan oeddant yn oed yn oed yn oed, ond…

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.960
Ond…

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.960
Yn oed…

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.960
Rydw i'n meddwl, os yw'r hyn yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed,

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:24.960
yna byddwn yn y debyg yma sy'n dechrau â'r pethau fel hyn.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.960
A gallwn i'n deall â'r pethau i unrhyw un, ond nid i'n deall â mi.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.960
Mae'n, rydw i'n meddwl, y ffordd yma, yw'n oed, yw'n oed?

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:34.960
Felly, oedd yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed i deall â'r pethau?

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.960
I ddod o'r bobl? Cymhwynt, yw'n oed.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:39.960
Ie, ie, ie.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.960
A yna byddwch yn ymwneud â'r manegor,

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.960
a'r sector, a'r bobl yn oed.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.960
Oherwydd, gallai ei ddod.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.960
Ie, os ydym wedi'i gynhyrchu.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.960
Byddwch yn oed yn oed yn cael rhywbeth fel hyn

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.960
pan mae'r mhen a'r fywyd yn gweithio gyda'ch chi, nid yw'n…

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.960
Yn oed, nid yw'n…

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.960
Nid yw'n gwirioneddol iawn.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.960
Ond…

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.960
Nid yw'n… Nid fel yw'n heddiw.
