Currently I'm not actually teaching any able-bodied classes, but I am co-teaching a class for children with autism.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I've been doing that for a year. And I never thought I'd be involved with children.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
How does yoga work with autism?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's great. With autism you have to have the maths the same every week.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You have to do some of the same things every week, so they've got their routine.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
They like the routine and it's just really good for them. And it improves their concentration.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
They just really enjoy it. We're talking about older children here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We did have mixed, to start with, younger ones, but that didn't work out.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
These seem to be all about, I don't know, 12 onwards, 12 to about 16.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And there's one young man who's 25, but mentally his age is a bit different.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So they're a bit more focused about age then, I guess.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Yes, I think so. But even the younger ones who come in, it worked for a while,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but they didn't leave because they didn't like it. They left for other reasons.
