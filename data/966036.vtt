00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
finding the right person and feeling comfortable in their silences but

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.200
enjoying their happiness and their sadness as well, being there when they're sad.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.200
Loving every part of the person, be it good or bad.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.400
Adam's Dad- Even the snoring?

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.800
Kirsty- Even the snoring.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.200
Adam's Dad- What would these be?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.600
Kirsty- Even the bouncing.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.200
Because we all shut up.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.400
Yeah, pretty much the same thing, you know, you can feel relaxed around the person.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.200
And as you say, being able to share a problem with the person.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.200
It's when the snoring is not there and when the moaning is not there, you think,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.600
well, I miss it now.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.400
Because when Steve was in hospital, I got really quite down and I started sleeping in his t-shirts

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.800
because it had a scent on and I did actually miss the snoring then and, you know,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.200
the things that you think, oh, I wish you'd just go away and leave me alone.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.600
When they're not there, you want them back, don't you?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Because when I've been in hospital, I come back and I say, I should go in hospital more often.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.200
Adam- Is there anything else you'd like to say before we end the video?
