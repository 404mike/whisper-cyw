00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
She Walks in Beauty by Lord Byron

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.840
Read by Joseph Milsun for the BBC

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.560
She walks in beauty,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.840
Like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.160
And all that's best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.480
Thus mellowed to that tender light which heaven to gaudy day denies.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.640
One shade the more, one ray the less,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.800
Had half impaired the nameless grace which waves

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.880
In every raven tress or softly lightens o'er her face,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.000
Where thoughts serenely sweet express how pure,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.520
How dear their dwelling place, and on that cheek,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.000
And o'er that brow so soft, so calm, yet eloquent,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.800
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.720
But tell of days in goodness spent,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.680
A mind at peace with all below,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.400
A heart whose love is innocent.
