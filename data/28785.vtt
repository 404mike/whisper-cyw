00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.200
Cardigan Bay wasn't always an inland sea. Legend speaks of a rich and fertile land,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.960
so fertile that one acre there was said to be worth four elsewhere. This land was called

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.880
Micegwydno, the land of Gwydno Garanhir, part of the kingdom of Merionydd. It stretched

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.600
some twenty miles west of the current shoreline. It was also known as Cantrer Gwaelod, the

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.960
lower hundredth, a hundredth being an early measurement of land, and lower referring to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.600
the fact that it was land that lay beneath the level of the sea. It was protected by

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.040
a great wall that was punctuated at river mouths by sluice gates that would let tides

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.400
in and out of estuaries, but keep the encroaching sea from the fertile arable lands.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.100
There are a number of versions of the story. It is first mentioned in the thirteenth century

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.780
book known as the Black Book of Cymardin. This is a collection of poems and much older material

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.220
relating to events that had taken place centuries before. Included is a poem called Bothi Micegwydno,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.860
the drowning of Gwydno's land. It is one of the finest examples of medieval Welsh poetry.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.220
Today, the Black Book of Cymardin is kept in the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.580
along with many other ancient Welsh texts and contemporary collections of writing. It's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.060
well worth a visit. There have been many versions of the story down the ages, but the most enduring

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.300
tells of how Saithenyn, the man responsible for maintaining the sea defences, fell in

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.740
love with Gwydnogarán hir's daughter Mereyrydd. At her wedding to another man, Saithenyn became

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.380
drunk and forgot to close the sea gates. When a storm whipped up, there was nobody

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.980
to raise the alarm. The sixteen villages of Cantergwaelod were swallowed whole by the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.820
waves. Some say that Gwydnogarán and a few of his men made it to safety. One version

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.820
says that Saithenyn's seven sons devoted themselves to God in reparation for their

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:17.740
father's actions, one of those sons being St Tidner, one of our early Celtic saints.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.580
The legend has inspired a number of poems and songs, including a well-known 19th century

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.540
air, the Bells of Aberdwyfi, which has become a standard amongst many Welsh choirs. When

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.340
the tide is low, very low, part of the ancient woodlands of Cantergwaelod can still be seen,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.220
and locals will tell you that when a gale stirs far out in the Irish sea, the bells

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.180
of Cantergwaelod can be heard ringing in the tide, warning those on shore of the coming

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.700
storm.
