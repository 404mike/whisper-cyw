00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When I was a bachelor I lived all alone, I worked and to weave I strayed,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And the only only thing I did that was growl was to a bayonet,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I pulled a girl in the wintertime that in the summer grew,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And the only only thing that I ever did growl was to keep her from the foggy foggy dew.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
One night she came to my red side and I lay fast asleep,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
She laid her head upon my bed and she began to weep,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
She sighed, she cried, she tabbed it high, she said, what can I do?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So I hold her in two hands and I coverd up the hand just to keep her from the foggy foggy dew.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now I am a bachelor and I live with my son, I love to work and to weave I strayed,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And every single time that I look into his eyes he reminds me of that bayonet,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He reminds me of the wintertime and of the summer dew,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And of the many many times I took her in my arms and I stood her from the foggy foggy dew.
