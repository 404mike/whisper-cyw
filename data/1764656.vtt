WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.180
So we're recording now. So my name is Paul Hunt and I work for Man Cap Cymru and could

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.120
you introduce yourself please? My name is Joe Powell. I work for All Wales People First.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.360
I'm on the autism spectrum and I lived in autism care for 11 years. And where do you

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.200
live at the moment? At the moment I live in Newport in South Wales. So obviously we've

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.440
interviewed you before under very different circumstances. Could you tell me a little

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.040
bit about what you've been up to for the last seven months? What's really interesting is

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.720
I've been working from home an awful lot. Now usually the organisation I work for, All

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.560
Wales People First, we got rid of our offices a long time ago so I didn't think it would

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.360
be much of a challenge. But I was really, really surprised because just going out to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.640
meetings a lot doesn't happen anymore. So everything is obviously home base now. Now

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.440
in one of the interviews I did before, and I'm not sure if this was used on the film,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.560
one of the interviews I did before with you, I was talking about how if there was a nuclear

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.040
war or a nuclear holocaust I wouldn't miss anybody and I'd be okay on my own. And I think

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.920
what I've learnt over these seven months is that I actually do need people. Maybe not

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.040
need people in the way other people need people. But actually, you know, no man is an island.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.720
And okay, it's been easier for me than your average bear. And it's easier for me than

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.320
most people. But actually, it's had a bigger toll on me than I thought. Although I would

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.200
say largely I've been unaffected compared to most people. So I think it was a massive

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.160
learning curve for me. So in a nutshell, all I've done is just work from home. That's it.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:58.480
Has it affected the way that you've accessed any social groups or not even groups necessarily

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.760
individuals you would have met up with in your spare time?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.800
Yeah, it's really affected in a few ways, positives and negatives. The negatives obviously

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.800
are there is not physical interface. One of the members I usually meet up with and we

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.280
have a got friends and we have a meal and we do some shopping that couldn't happen.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.320
But we've actually done more member engagement because of this. In the past, for instance,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.640
people were learning disabilities if we were to put an idea to zoom or teams to them, they

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.720
would just turn it down and flatly refuse. I think it's a no, we can't do that. That's

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.760
not a thing. So we never went there. We always did things physically because of zoom. So

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.440
because of the COVID-19 situation, I think there's been an element of the necessities

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.920
the mother of invention. People have been forced to come out of their comfort zone and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.800
learn things like zoom because if they don't, they're not going to be able to mix with people

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.080
and have any social interaction. And because of that, I actually think during these times,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.440
we've got more we've got more engagement with members now than we've ever done before.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.240
And do you think if things return back to normal, you'll do things the way you used

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.080
to or do you think you might continue online just because there's so many more people involved?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.440
I personally would like to get a mixture of the two things. I think I think definitely the person

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.040
thinks good at regular intervals, but at the same time, you know, just so there's a human contact

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.440
and that's good for certainly for staff team morale. And I think members need to be together

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.400
in a place so they can feel that physical connection. But I think in terms of resources

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.120
and time, the fact that we've been able to do stuff on zoom that we wouldn't have dreamed before.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.960
Also, there are times when I think it would be lovely just to have, say,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.160
team meetings and other meetings online as well. One of the benefits, for start, you cut out the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.560
travel time, especially people live in different parts of Wales. One of the major benefits

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.280
of of this kind of technology as well. Oh, I lost my thread then I'm so sorry.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.360
That's all right. There was a major benefit, which I'm trying to think of this technology.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.680
Oh, we go back to sorry, I'll just take you while I get my thread.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.200
You're asking, would we go back? So that's a positive we can connect with more people. Oh,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.080
yeah, yeah, yeah. Another problem we're having is with our national council in terms of physical

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.280
meetings. So our national council is our member led forum across Wales, where we bring all reps

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.800
from all counties to one place to hold me to account as chief executive and set our strategy.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.440
There are some parts of Wales where people could have an impact on their benefits. If they seem to

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.760
travel independently, might not be able to get to our physical meetings. Now that was in the past,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.760
a real problem for us. And before Covid, we were already looking at how do we make this happen? How

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.400
do we get people to meetings that they can't attend? We looked at one of those hubs, you know,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.120
those Amazon hubs. Yeah. We look at those portals. But since this look at it, Zoom,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.200
we've now realized it's much easier to do this now. It's not ideal. But if say we do go to

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.520
North Wales and people from the South can't get there, we can beam them in. If we're in the South

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.840
and people from the North can't get there, we beam them in. So it gives us that flexibility,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:35.000
which we didn't have before. And so thinking away from your role in your personal life,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.240
how has it affected how you communicate with friends or family?

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.160
It's really strange because I don't really communicate with friends or family very often

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.160
anyway, because I am such a loner. But it's still affected me an awful lot. And it's affected me in

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.680
a way you wouldn't imagine. I have more social contact now than ever before since Zoom. And this

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.600
is because of the Covid situation. Meetings, meetings that would happen quarterly, and now

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.400
were happening for a long time weekly. And then there were subgroup meetings to that and prep

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.840
meetings. So it actually put a lot of pressure on me. And I found interacting as a person with

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:23.000
autism online under that format, excruciatingly painful to the point where at times I just wasn't,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.520
I was being spoken over and what have you. And I've got to be honest, in one meeting,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.320
I really lost my temper. And I really put my foot down and said, I'm on the autism spectrum,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.920
have some consideration. Which I hated, because I don't want to do that. I don't want to,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.840
I'm not ashamed to have autism, but I just want to appear like any other chief exec, any other

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.760
employee of an organisation. But I got into that situation where I really got upset and annoyed.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.440
So in terms of participation, it's harder because of Zoom, unless people hand up through the chair.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.800
It's a nightmare for me, because I need to see the social cues. But also, I have more meetings now

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:07.080
than I ever did by a country mile on Zoom. And that stifles me and my ability to do stuff I really

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.560
need to do for the job. So it's actually put a lot of pressure on me in that response. And of course,

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.840
when the social things don't happen as well as I thought, I then doubt myself, I doubt my position,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:23.560
I doubt who I am. Am I really qualified to do this job? So it's had a negative impact on my well-being.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.840
There's no doubt about it. But I'd say not because of lack of social contact, but because of too much

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:36.120
of it. So do you think if you were the kind of person to talk to friends and family often, do you

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:45.720
think that and your job, how do you think you would cope with that? With my family, I never

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.600
saw them much anyway, but I used to video conference them once a week. So that was dead

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:56.360
straightforward. I think that wouldn't be an issue for me, to be honest. You know what I mean? With

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:02.200
the friends and family, I don't think, no, I never really went out with people much anyway.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.840
And when I did, it was only over the telephone if we spoke. And if we did go out to be like once a

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:14.520
quarter or something, very rare. So I remember you said at the start of our conversation that you

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.960
were surprised that, you know, you thought you couldn't, you could do without the contact and

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.520
you now find that you need it. Do you think that will change how you approach things when we are

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:31.880
allowed to interact with people again? I think I won't change how I approach things, but I think

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:38.440
I'll appreciate more when I am with people, when I'm not always wanting to be there or there's times

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.560
when I'm thinking, God, I wish I could just work from home. I've become more aware of how sometimes

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.200
you just need to be around people sometimes, because sometimes just being with a person and

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.880
having a positive conversation in person can just make you feel positive. You can come back.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.960
So there's times I'll go out for a meeting, say at 10 o'clock in the morning, and we don't have our

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.160
offices. So I go to another organization, have a meeting. But if that meeting just goes quite well,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:08.920
or it goes okay, or a point of view you've expressed has been understood or respected,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.120
you go home and think about yourself, you know, and you've broken the deal by being out. So when

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.520
you do come home and do admin, just that hour or two out makes a big difference to your well-being

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.960
when you come back, because you've had some interaction. And I think it's made me more

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:30.440
appreciative of that. And I think I've done a lot of self-reflection. And I do sometimes wonder,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.240
now with hindsight, when I keep saying I don't need people, I don't need people,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.360
maybe I do need people, maybe I've always needed people. Maybe the problem has been for me,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.480
as somebody who was non-verbal for years and had a lot of problems with my autism and Asperger's,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.440
maybe I've just learned or I've been forced in a position where I was socially isolated so much,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.120
that it just became the norm. And I was out of the loop so much that it became my new normal.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.720
And maybe with hindsight, it's not that I don't need people. Maybe with hindsight,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:08.280
it is more the fact that I've just lost the ability to know how to deal with,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.680
to work with people. And I've lost the ability to know what I've lost out on.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:20.040
Mm-hmm. That's an interesting viewpoint. I suppose we've touched on this a little bit,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.800
but do you think it's affected your well-being, being either locked out or at least

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:32.280
physically distancing from people? I think it's definitely affected my well-being in terms of

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:38.760
the overload of information. So I'm not just doing my job, but there's constant emails,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:45.960
constant chats, follow-up actions. It's definitely done that. That makes me more aware of being on

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:51.880
the autism spectrum, being different to my peers. That makes me doubt myself more. So I think there's

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:58.760
definitely been all that going on from a selfish point of view. I think absolutely that has

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:05.880
certainly affected me. I think I've got away with it more than most people in the grand scheme of

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:12.280
things. I've actually been very, very lucky, luckier than the vast majority of people I'd say.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:19.800
But yeah, it really has impacted for those reasons. Yeah, I'd say for those reasons.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.760
So you're talking to me today from your sofa. Do you have a workspace at home?

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.000
I have an office in my house upstairs, and the internet's rubbish. So I end up sitting on the

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.360
sofa and doing work there. The problem is I always used to just work all day anyway,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:45.640
so I didn't really have much of a social boundary. I think now it's even less so with me working from

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.400
home because I'm constantly working, whereas before, at least if you're on the train,

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.960
going somewhere, you know, you might have 10 minutes to yourself to think, or what have you.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.760
Now I'm not even doing that really. You might break for something to get back. So you end up

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:07.160
doing a lot more hours. Productivity's massive. Has it changed your relationship with your

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.680
home and your living area? Do you see it now as one thing, or was it always like that?

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.760
I think for me it was always like that anyway because even when I used to come home,

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.560
when I did go to meetings, I would still sit down and do loads of works and send emails out.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:28.360
I think work's my hobby as well, which is very tragic. But I think it is. And so actually when

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.480
I come home in an evening, when my hours are done, I'll put the telly on in the background

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.640
and what have you because I like that feeling of being at home. But I can't just sit and watch

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.440
the television anyway. I'd have to be doing something. So in that respect, no, I don't think

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:51.800
it's made much of a difference. So do you talk to anyone at the moment, like a friend or maybe a

00:12:51.800 --> 00:13:00.920
family member, about not just the pandemic but everyday life? No, I don't think I do, to be honest.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:09.880
I talk to staff mostly and that's on everyday work stuff or I help them with their problems. But

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.920
no, very rarely, to be honest. I speak to my parents once a week online because they've now

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.920
moved back to the northeast of England, interestingly, and they did it in the middle

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.040
of the pandemic. So I'm literally isolated now. I just live on my own, which doesn't seem to affect

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:33.320
me at the minute for health reasons they need to be up there. But no, I don't really know.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:40.600
There's a lady called Yvonne Boxall who used to do my job in the past before we give it to somebody

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.560
with lived experience. And I check in with her now and again if I'm worried. So I say once a week,

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:51.240
I call her and I check in with her and that's normally about, is this normal? Is this normal?

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.200
Is this normal? So if somebody behaves in a certain way I don't understand, I check out with Yvonne

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.560
and it's like, is that because I've got autism? Is that because they know I'm different? And she's

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.520
sitting there, what's happened to me all the time? So that's the kind of stuff I check out. And

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:10.920
Warrie, is it about Yvonne that makes you feel comfortable talking to her? I think Yvonne gets me

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.800
and very few people do. The amount of psychologists and counselors I've had over the years and

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.040
yeah, I'm very complicated like that. But I think it's because she knows my job.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.560
We get on well anyway because we just see things very similarly in terms of the third sector.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:32.280
And I think over a period of time she's been able to get to know me. I think as well the fact that

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:37.240
she comes from a learning disability background as a support worker. She was a special education

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:42.200
teacher and all that. I think there's a mixture of all that really means that she's more

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:49.560
insightful and understanding of my needs than a lot of people would be. So would you

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:56.680
would you view her as a friend or maybe a former colleague? I know the distinction can sometimes

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.720
be difficult to make because you know we spend most of our time with our colleagues and often

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.760
they become friends. But how would you view Yvonne in that kind of way? Isn't that a brilliant

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:12.520
question? And you might think why? Because you know what? I've never thought of that.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.240
Do you know I never call anybody a friend and I don't even know. I guess it's a friendship I

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:24.200
suppose. I never think of it as a friendship. I just think of it as this is a I'll not swear

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.840
because obviously we're all recorded but I think of it as just one of the very few people in the

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:35.800
world that don't get on my nerves. I don't think of it as a friendship although actually I would

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:41.880
reciprocate and I would do anything for her if she wanted to and I'm fond of her so maybe it's a

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:47.240
friendship. You know I don't think I understand what a friendship is and maybe I've got friendships

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.240
and don't even know I've got them. I know there's lots of people who call me their friend and I

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:57.000
think oh that's nice but I'm not necessarily sure if I'm a friend back. It's you know.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:04.200
How would you view then I presume you're on Facebook. You know the term friend is used

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.280
quite loosely on there to describe people you're connected to. Would you describe any of them as

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:15.160
friends or just I don't know connections? Yeah I would see them as associates as people we know

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:21.480
through people first. I use it more as a work platform. Some people call me their friend and

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:29.080
then I give them a lot of emotional support in the evenings which isn't really a reciprocal

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.400
relationship really. It's more me being there to listen to them and speak to them which I'm happy

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:39.160
to do. So they would see me as a friend. I don't necessarily see them as friends you know. Interestingly

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:46.280
enough I just see them as people who have asked me for help and I help them because that's my nature

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.920
but they would probably be devastated at that because they would see me as a friend.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:58.600
So with Yvonne do you listen to her concerns or you know does she chat to you about things

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.320
that are going on? She does. It's mostly mine to be honest. Not from a selfish point of view but

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.800
she's back to work all the time. She's to work for us and I'll give her the updates what's happening

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:13.080
and then I'll run something past her. But yeah we talk about her too. I'd say it's about 25% of Yvonne,

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:18.840
75% me I'd say. But I do ask about it and I do check in and I ask how her family are and all

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:26.360
the rest of it and I've given her emotional support at times. Mostly it's me but I don't phone all the

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.160
time from the you know I phone as I guess I do phone as a friend. I phone when I think about it.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:37.400
I phone as a how are you every Sunday or something. Sometimes I phone and say God I'm really sorry

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:43.320
Yvonne I'm not sure what to do can I have your advice? But mostly it's a catch-up thing and I

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.960
think because we both come from the one thing we've got in common is we both work for all Wales

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:55.160
people first. So I guess it always comes back down to work for that reason more than anything.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.520
And do you I know we're getting inside your topic but do you think

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.760
if a time comes where you leave your current position you would stay in touch with your

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:12.360
colleagues as friends? I think so yeah I'm not sure. I think Yvonne maybe I've got a funny

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.280
feeling I'll probably lose contact with everybody else when I think actually when I think about it.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.280
And strange thing if I went to say work in a factory or do something different

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:25.960
I would be completely isolated. It's funny it's because I do my job and because of the nature of

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.480
the job other people learning disabilities then contact me and they want to spend time with me

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:37.000
and I think that's where my social validation comes from and I think if I went to an ordinary

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.120
everyday job I would be so isolated and I'd have no purpose left when I think about it.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.240
When I think about it the more I think about it this job although it doesn't give you know

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.680
although I don't maybe distinguish friends the way other people distinguish friends

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.520
actually it's because of this job that people want to speak to me they know who I am they want to

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:02.120
chat with me they invite me to stuff so all my social validation comes through this job and the

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:10.280
nature of what this is. And so as that validation you felt changed since having to do it online

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.400
I know you talked earlier about doubting your abilities. No I think now people want because

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.840
people are lonely and they're isolated in the lockdown they want to talk more so in the past

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.400
when people might want to chat people want to chat a lot more now because they want somebody to talk

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:31.640
to and I'm there and I'm happy to talk so I say now it's increased it's increased again and because

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.440
there's a lot of information that we feed to Welsh Government about members experiences members are

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.760
more likely to reach out now and say Joe can I tell you something can I tell you what's going

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:49.320
on for me so yeah. You mentioned that your parents have recently moved back to the North of England

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:55.400
how did you feel when they told you? It's really interesting it was my idea funny enough

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:03.320
not because I was trying to get rid of them but ironically I'm going to be honest look they annoy

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.080
me at times and I feel terrible for it because they love me to bits and if anything happened

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:14.120
they'd be the first there for me but I was just aware my dad's having health problems more and

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.240
more with cancer and different things and he's getting treated my mom can't cope with anything

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:25.000
I mean literally can't cope with a thing and there's no way she can cope we're looking after

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.560
me dad and I was just aware that as much as they love living in Wales and I love living in Wales

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:36.920
they're not really happy they're not miserable but they were never as happy as they could be

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.440
they missed their grandchildren growing up so I said to them look you know what you'd be better

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:48.280
off up there because you would see my new nephew who's just been born they missed the other four

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:54.520
growing up they're in their late teens early 20s now there's a new one born and if my dad has any

00:20:54.520 --> 00:21:00.360
crisis or any health problems my sister's there to support me mom and be there for them so I suggested

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.080
it and they were over the moon because they'd actually thought about this for a bit themselves

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:11.000
but didn't want to leave me in the lurch and I said well no I'll be all right we've got video

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
software we can talk we can still keep in touch but actually it's better for you it's better for

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.120
you there's nothing for you here now it's better for you to move forward so that's how that happened

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:29.640
so yeah yeah do you do you notice any difference the fact that they're in the north of England

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.640
compared to when they were maybe up the road with you isn't it really interesting but not a

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:41.400
not a difference at all I'm a cool person but no not at all I still talk about football and I'll

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.200
check the house for them um because they haven't sold it yet they're living with me sister's house

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:54.120
um but no it's like nothing's changed really and and so when things return to normal will you see

00:21:54.120 --> 00:22:00.840
them as often as you used to then? via video I will yeah and I'll go and visit them for

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.480
Christmases and stuff which would be nice this Christmas is obviously a write-off it seems to be

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.400
but I'll go and visit them for the summer for my birthday for Christmas it'll be lovely that

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:16.440
because I'll go to see the northeast again I'll have somewhere to stay um so yeah I'll do that

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.080
but I would say in that respect I guess I would see them just as much as I used to see them

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:28.360
um sorry go on Joe I was going to say in the past it would come safer to visit my house I

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.760
didn't visit them that often because I don't drive or anything and it's easy for them to get here

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.720
so I guess it would still be once a week but on video instead of once a week in person

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:48.360
and did am I right in thinking they had a dog oh yes yes um Tigger yes Tiggs now I think I

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.160
spoke last time about how I could really relate to him and I gave him a hug and I was always

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.040
squeezing Tigger when he got put down last November would you believe oh I'm sorry to hear that

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.800
yeah it was an interesting one because and this is where my emotions got very very strange

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.920
and I don't know if it's an autism logic thing or whether I'm just cold but I love Tiggs and every

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.160
time I saw him I couldn't resist squeezing him and kissing him and all the other stuff but when he

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.320
was put down my mum and dad were in tears we all went to the vet and what have you he had cancer

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.440
he had to get put down but I was just so logical about it all and I thought well

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:29.560
if we let if we don't do the procedure now in a month or two's time they reckon he could die

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.760
in real agony in real discomfort so I thought well actually let's celebrate his life let's

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.320
celebrate the love we give him and what he gave back for us but we have a wonderful gift because

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:45.640
we can end this for him now we have control of the situation and we can put him out of his misery now

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:51.080
not many human beings get that opportunity human beings in the same position would just have to

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:57.400
die in agony we're in a position to to control this for him and I'm not saying when I got home

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:03.960
I didn't feel a kind of sickening knot in my stomach but for me it was almost like he was there

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.680
now he's not there and it was that that black and white even though what you know I think about him

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:13.160
a lot and I think about squeezing him a lot and I think about hugging him a lot I don't kind of

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:21.160
feel the need to burst into tears the way my parents do and so would it be fair do you miss

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:28.120
him and everything he gave you or is it just you miss what he was able to give you in terms of

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:33.480
you know squeezing him and and affection and things it's really strange you know I'm very

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:43.720
fond of him and I have fun thoughts of him but I don't miss him do you would you like if your

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.960
parents got another dog do you think you would be as attached to that dog as you are as you were

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:54.120
yeah I'd be silly with him I'd be absolutely daft yeah we had a Yorkshire Terrier before him and I

00:24:54.120 --> 00:25:00.120
was the same with him it's weird I get I'm crazy about them when they're around and I love them and

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.680
I can't leave them alone but then when they're gone it's like my brain just thinks oh they're

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.800
gone and it doesn't see the logic in crying or getting upset about it I don't know if that's an

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.600
autistic thing or what but it's just logic it's like oh they're gone now oh it's interesting

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.160
and so have you have you entertained the idea of maybe getting a dog yourself

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:25.080
yeah well funny enough I did and then I thought because I live on my own especially my parents

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:30.600
have gone because I stay away overnight at times there'd be nobody there for the dog so I thought

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.560
maybe I better not do that I did think about getting a cat I'm not a massive fan of cats but

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.600
they reckon there's a breed of cat who are quite like dogs who are affectionate but because they

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:45.320
don't need so much attention I thought we'd be getting two cats so they could keep each other

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.600
company and I could leave a litter tray for them and food when I go out I did consider that for a

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:58.920
bit but I think the practically I'm not sure whether I could but yeah I'd love a dog really

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:05.240
ideally I'm just not sure how fair it would be with me being living on my own so sorry did you

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.440
say you had a cat oh sorry no I considered having a cat all right sorry and I thought if I considered

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.800
getting two cats then they could keep each other company and if I did go out somewhere it wouldn't

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.680
be so so bad it'd be cruel even a dog but with cats that have got company and they've got their

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:27.080
food they're more likely to cope because I think dogs always need that hug and that reassurance and

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:38.360
pardon me so I mean one of the areas we're talking about with people is around physical intimacy but

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:44.680
I suppose how have your feelings on that changed since lockdown it really hasn't you know I'm not

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.400
kidding you one of the things I've done in the evenings I've been I've been watching box sets of

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:55.960
things and I never saw shameless ever I knew about I never saw it so I was watching shameless and

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:03.400
it's an interesting one because when there's sex scenes and stuff and it's like a sexy thing I get

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.440
attracted to it you know what I mean I get kind of I get turned on by it by one of an expression

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:15.640
but it still fascinates me that this is actually real that it's done and I know that it's one

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:21.000
thing for me to think it but I would never ever make that connection still with oh I

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:27.080
I'm attracted to this person why don't I see this through why don't I see for one of the better

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.000
words why don't I see if I can get it on with them and see if we can do this and when I watch

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.040
things like shameless okay it's exaggerated and it's over the top but you actually think

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.480
but you actually think oh people actually do have sex and people actually do do this stuff

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.000
and this is real and I'm like wow and that makes me question myself again why am I different why

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.120
am I cool why am I this and then I just seem to forget that this stuff happens and I still

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:56.680
find it fascinating that everyday respectable people in society who might get embarrassed if

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:02.600
people mention sexual things at the same time actually have sex are not embarrassed about that

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:10.120
but yet don't like talking about it it's yeah so long short answer no it

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:18.040
still hasn't changed still and I even think people I know females I know who I get on quite well with

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.400
I think what would it be like to be their boyfriend I wonder what it would be like this

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:28.040
and the other and there's no feeling inside there's no other than oh that's strange it just

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.480
doesn't seem logical you know I see boyfriends and girlfriends who just met each other madly

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.960
in love and I think well how can you be madly in love with a complete stranger I don't know

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:47.080
so when things return to normal what what would you be looking forward to doing

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:54.040
first that perhaps you can't do now you know what's really interesting is in a strange way

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:59.160
nothing would change for me I'd be looking forward to getting on with the business this is a

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.840
terribly terribly square answer but I'd be looking forward to getting on with the business plan that

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.120
we were funded by Welsh Government to do which meant going out and doing outward things my biggest

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.560
inconveniences were having to find other ways to do things that were meant to deliver outside

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:21.000
I guess like this project for a certain extent I imagine you're imagining you're expecting to

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.400
interview me in person via video or what have you or sound recorder and we're doing it via zoom

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:33.320
it's more I want to get back to doing what we plan to do in the business plan I think

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.680
straightforward as that and do you think things will go back to how they were before do you think

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:45.800
things will have changed slightly I on my instinct is that 2021 is a write-off I hate to see it I've

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:53.240
got a feeling that's already gone I think 2022 it will be back to normal in terms of coronavirus

00:29:53.240 --> 00:30:00.120
being safe but I think there will be differences in this experience that people will incorporate

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.040
so I think there'll be certain other organizations who might also close their offices and think well

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:08.760
actually we can work from home I think there'll be some other people who see the benefits of social

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.640
video media interfacing and interviews I think there'll be an element of that

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.120
yeah I think there'll be lessons learned in that respect

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.960
what has all of this period you know COVID coronavirus whatever you want to call it what

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:32.360
has it meant to you I think for me it's exactly I think what's really interesting is and I'm coming

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:38.600
back to a political work situation here but what's really interesting is you know in the

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.760
work that I do we've talked about coronavirus and the unfair impact on people with learning

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.920
disabilities and what have you but I think what this has really shown to me is that

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:57.640
coronavirus is not the problem coronavirus just exacerbates an injustice that was already been

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:05.880
there anyway in terms of choice control people making decisions for other people without

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:11.000
concluding them and the mortality problems for people learning disabilities that were there before

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.360
they're the same mortality problems under COVID is the COVID hasn't caused

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.880
hasn't caused the inequalities and the inequalities were already there and I think

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:24.600
what it's taught me more than anything is again whenever there's a crisis of any type

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.960
it is the most vulnerable people who are always going to be affected first

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:36.600
I don't know if that's the right answer to give in terms of me personally but I think it again it

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:43.640
comes back to down to my job and my work it just refocuses this idea of the injustice the social

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.200
injustice

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:56.440
and so do you have any like concerns about the next two months I think winter is going to be a

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:02.360
really really difficult time for you personally or in terms of work um personally and work

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.640
yeah personally no personally I'm looking forward to it I've got a new settee coming

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:11.960
after I wrecked this one and I'm looking forward to having a Christmas and I'm looking forward to

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.280
switching my brain off because I really need to do that because it's obsessive anyway and

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:21.400
it's thinking and it's whatever um work-wise yeah I think I think winter is going to be a

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:26.920
terrible time for people with learning disabilities in lots of ways um there's going to be more

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:34.520
inequalities obviously the potential isolation the day centres still aren't open um in some cases

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:40.440
I think the longer it goes on the harder it is to tolerate and and and to keep up to date with so

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:46.760
yeah I think winter is going to be a really tough time for people with learning disabilities even

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:54.200
tougher than it's been so far and so do you think there's any positive things that have come out of

00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:00.680
all all of the last seven months I think there's been a lot of positives isn't that a strange thing

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.400
I think one of the things we're seeing is as much as our members people learn disabilities

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:11.480
in some ways have suffered a lot of negativity in some ways they've also been more

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:18.200
more involved in their local communities because local communities who have often kind of shied

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:23.000
away from people with learning disabilities because they've kind of rallied around and

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.720
they've tried to get uh make sure everybody in the community's got food and what have you

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.440
I think it's actually meant people learn to be more involved in the community than maybe they

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:37.640
were before some of our members have actually helped local councils with litter collection

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:43.720
and different stuff they've been involved in that respect I think the increase in digital literacy

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:48.440
of people with learning disabilities has vastly increased and I think it would have been more of

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:55.560
a challenge to do this in non-covid times I guess as I was saying before they've been forced to have

00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:03.000
to do it necessity is the mother of invention and all that so their digital literacy has increased

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.960
we've saw real leadership as well there have been some members who become real leaders who've been

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.840
there for other people who've done online events and quizzes to help other people they become real

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:18.280
self-advocates real champions they've had their voice heard so there's been a lot of positives

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:27.480
actually I think I think no doubt about that and you mentioned Christmas um what will you do

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:33.640
at Christmas now absolutely nothing which is I'm gonna love it's gonna be bizarre I'll have my

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.880
house done all beautiful ready for Christmas and I'll have it all spic and span I'll have my new

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:46.120
sofa and I might play the PlayStation and I'll just have a very sedate non-thinking few days

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:52.360
and that to me would be bliss will you see anyone or talk to anyone via the internet

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:58.280
my mom and dad probably I'll say well definitely more than likely I'll say hello to on video

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:04.360
chats and what have you and new year um but that would be it I'd imagine

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:13.320
and you're fine with that oh absolutely no definitely I can hear how I'm sounding when

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:19.800
I'm saying this but yeah it's uh it's bliss for me I think part of that just because my brain's

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:25.000
constantly overloaded um I've been looking at stuff because I'm always trying to second guess

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.320
who am I who am I and I think I fit into this thing called the highly sensitive person

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:35.800
which I've seen online and I think the volume and the is turned up I've got such a rich inner life

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:43.160
and the volume of my thoughts in the world is so high that um I think one of the reasons I live

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:48.600
and think the way I do isn't just somebody with autism although this could be part of it too I

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:55.560
think it is because the volume's turned up and I need so much downtime and switch off time to to

00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:01.720
exist that where other people might be absolutely driven to distraction for me it's just like

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:10.600
somebody needing a nap it needing to disengage how have you found shopping for food during all of

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:18.760
this I'm laughing because I got done for shoplifting last week that story it's hilarious um

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:24.120
uh five long story short fine it was it was a problem at first because I couldn't go to

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:29.560
supermarkets that didn't drive and my dad couldn't get me to supermarkets or anything like that

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:34.120
because of he had health concerns as well and in them days you know weren't meant to mix households

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:39.480
and all that so I had to get a taxi when I had to do a supermarket run and that was more of a pain

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:45.560
and it was an inconvenience and I had to pay for for taxis the uh I the shoplifting thing was an

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:50.040
accident it was last week um I went to the supermarket thought I'd done the chip and

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.520
pin on the machine long story short and right in front of an armed policeman who was behind me I

00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:00.440
just walked out my shopping and this stopped me and I explained it it was all sorted it was all fine

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:08.520
so I think I'm get definitely getting absent-minded as well um yeah and how do you

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:18.360
feel about the face masks oh I hate them I really do um I just find them so hot and uncomfortable

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:24.200
I mean I you know I use them and I and I obey the rules and one of those people and I would never be

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:31.960
irresponsible I'm not going to panic over Covid if I get it I get it and if I've got to die I'll die

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:36.040
you know and I know it's a terrible thing to say but the point I'm trying to make is I would never

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:41.400
break the rules and I would always follow the rules for other people's safety and well-being

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:47.080
but I'm not one of those people who was going to panic about it either life too short I'm just

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.760
going to get on with it and do my best um I hate the mask because it's red hot it steams me glasses

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:59.640
up and after a few seconds I find it hard to breathe so yeah real real inconvenience and I

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.920
keep forgetting to bring them to the shops and I've got to keep coming back and getting them

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.880
and how do you feel when you see other people wearing it have you communicated with anyone

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:14.680
wearing a mask I haven't but when I first saw people wearing masks to my shame I don't know

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:20.120
in the supermarkets I remember thinking you fool what are you doing this is before with mandatory

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:25.480
and everything and I thought well come on that's over the top isn't it um maybe that was foolish

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:33.000
of me maybe that was ignorant of me with hindsight now um now I just see it as a necessary thing a

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.680
necessary evil to be fair at that time as well I think you know in Wales it was advised that

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.320
there's no evidence for masks as well there was no need for you to wear them you know that was the

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:49.800
official advice then to be fair to myself but but no I don't really think twice about them

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:57.880
is it do you find it um difficult if you were to communicate with someone you couldn't see their

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:03.240
mouth so they're you know half of their face or would it bother you no it just bothered me to be

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:11.240
honest in some ways it's it's it's socially easier because you know in terms of um it's less

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:16.520
sensory in part when I say if I don't see people's mouths and because I don't see the

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:21.880
expressions on their faces I don't then have to overreact in terms of did they mean this

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.480
did they mean that did they mean the other I can just take the words for what as long as they're

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:32.520
clear enough I can just take them at whatever their word is and how about the the two meter

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:40.040
thing in shops um how have you found trying to follow that I've been all right with that I found

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:47.000
it more inconvenient than anything but I'm aware we have to do it um if anything I get more ratty

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.720
at the fact that it means that the queues are like sometimes really long or they were long

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.720
and I'm one of those people I get really impatient because I just want to get on

00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:00.920
go to the shops get back and do what I want to do so I'm more affected by my own impatience and

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:06.440
the fact that I can't get on and do stuff the way I want to do it but but I obey it and there's no

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:13.400
issues with that it's more of a selfish thing really um and do you currently or

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:18.440
understand the rules have you always understood the rules of the as they have been announced

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.120
do you know what's really weird here and I'm going to be really honest with you

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:29.240
I've never really understood them I know what the rules are but I can't honestly say I've always

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:34.120
known why we have to do it I know it's a thing called covid and I know it keeps us safe I've

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.960
had such little interest it's really weird and I think this is where it goes back to me living in

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:43.560
my own bubble I know this thing called covid I know people could get ill I know people could die

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:49.080
and it's very serious and in order to stop that happening you've got to do x y and z so I do x y

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:54.920
and z I play the game but do I know why I'm doing x y and z exactly for whatever individual reason

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:03.240
probably not have you ever found the rules themselves confusing or pretty clear to follow

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:11.560
I find them confusing just from the point of view that they're so contradictory a lot of them are

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:17.320
guidance they're not necessarily rules they're open to interpretation they're changing then

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:22.520
you've got the communication from Wales and Scotland the fact that it's such a big big issue

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:28.280
and you can't hide from it I get overloaded by that and I think that's part of the reason why I

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:33.240
kind of just switch off to it and my attitude is just tell me what I've got to do and I'll do it

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.280
but not necessarily fully understanding exactly why

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:47.640
So I think that's about it Joe unless there's anything else that you think you may have missed

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:52.760
talking about do anything you wanted to say no I think that's it really I think the main thing is

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:58.040
it's just my lesson the big big thing I've learned as I said before it's just I guess I do need

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:03.480
people even if I didn't think I did I think that's been a big learning curve for me in a big lesson

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:13.320
yeah and will that and will the fact that you now realize that change how you go about things

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:20.200
I think so I think what it will do is I think my well-being will get better as well I think

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:25.160
like I say even going out just to another organization in Cardiff for a meeting for an

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.480
hour or two and coming back breaks of the day makes you feel better about yourself I think those

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:35.160
mornings when you get up and you're not always motivated especially in a cold morning to go to

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.960
a meeting in the morning or why we're having this meeting it'll make you realize well the

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.520
alternative is remember there was a time Joe when you were in the house 24 7 you know

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.880
Well thank you very much Joe I'm going to stop recording now brilliant

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:57.080
if I how do I do it oh no I think it just keeps recording till we stop the call actually

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.400
stop recording here we are
