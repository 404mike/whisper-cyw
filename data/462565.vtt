00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
Do you think television influenced your leisure time at all?

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.160
Well, not really.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.560
No, it probably kept the children quiet for an hour

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.280
and that was the main reason you put it on,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.120
but mostly it was for the news.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.000
Because that's what we missed, I think.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You know, we used to go to the cinema to see what was happening on the news.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.600
Like the 1956 floods and things?

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.800
I suppose we watched things like Coronation Street for a long time,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.080
but the thing is that even then it doesn't matter if you miss a few episodes.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.560
You know, we're not addicts to that extent,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.760
but I don't know what else is on regularly.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:00.160
Oh, I like things like Morse and the Minder and things like that,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.880
rather than a lot of the programmes I don't actually sit and watch.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.440
Heartbeat, yes.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.280
And the Songs of Praise.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.280
Yeah, you see, you mentioned some time about S4C.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:24.960
Well, we had good S4C at one stage and then they came around and adjusted your set

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.880
and it still worked for a while.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.520
But where we live in Coed Pwyth,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.440
and this doesn't apply to the whole of Coed Pwyth,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.480
our main television comes from the Midlands.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.760
So people who only wanted Welsh television,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.560
they've had to have special aerials pointing in a certain direction

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.760
and not necessarily getting a good picture.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.480
Well, because you get a good picture on something else,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.360
well, you stay to that, but I don't know what else happened.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.240
I don't think we've ever been able to get S4C until it went digital

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.480
until it went digital and now it's a good signal.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.200
Well, I haven't found it yet.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.600
But BBC Wales, we can't get at all.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.800
We get Granada and HTV or whatever it is.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.560
ITV Wales, that's all right.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.360
I, yes, well, I leave what the television in the dining room,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.320
I leave that on ITV Wales so that I haven't got a fiddle with it.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:41.520
But I have to scroll up and down to get BBC One Wales.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.600
I've managed to get that, but so far I don't think I found BBC Two Wales.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.040
But there are many people around me who have Sky for that reason.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.240
So, but you see, it really does depend because I don't think David gets good reception.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.560
Despite, you know, they had different aerials and they've tried.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.280
Well, we've got two aerials, but as I say, it comes from over there.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.080
I think the Bedwin Mountains stop anything.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.800
They're supposed to put a new transmitter, but I'm sure it's on the whirrl.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.760
I really don't know.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.280
It's magic as far as I'm concerned.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.800
They switch something on and it's on fair enough.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.720
I mean, I watch Campton and things like that.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.400
Of everything that you have seen on television,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.400
what's made the greatest impression on you?

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.920
Probably somebody more.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.440
Well, the Royal Functions, you know, we're a great one for ceremonial things

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.440
and you know, watch it and watch it and it's on all day and we.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.640
The Queen's hat at the.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.120
At the investiture.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.320
I don't know what happened.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.880
She normally has very nice hats, but that one was not.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.000
Like a helmet.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.520
Yeah, I don't know what else.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.320
I suppose it's a bit like now you.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.880
It's it's disasters that really, you know, you.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.200
You take more notice and it's right there with you.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200
It's like Japan at the moment.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.080
I mean, it was Christchurch a couple of weeks ago and I have a feeling you see,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.240
I went to New Zealand a couple of years ago because my step-grandson is now living there

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.600
and I have a feeling that the hotel we stayed in is no longer there sort of thing and.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.640
You're very thankful and it was.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.400
That's when you went.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.280
But they're all the other side of the world like Aberfan was here, wasn't it?
