00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Come, come, let's be there for thee,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Then, by the hour, in the night,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And in the morning, on this morning,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
By the hour, in the night,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And soon, now, all the lights are lit,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Is there a world that I need,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In the heart of the night?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Set me the view,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
All that's new,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Come, come, let's be there for thee,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And in the morning, on this morning,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
By the hour, in the night,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And soon, now, all the lights are lit,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Is there a world that I need,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In the heart of the night?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Set me the view,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
All that's new,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Come, come, let's be there for thee,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Then, by the hour, in the night,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And soon, now, all the lights are lit,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Is there a world that I need,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In the heart of the night?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Set me the view,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
All that's new,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Come, come, let's be there for thee,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And in the morning, on this morning,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
By the hour, in the night,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And soon, now, all the lights are lit,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Is there a world that I need,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
In the heart of the night?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Set me the view,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
All that's new,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Come, come, let's be there for thee,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Then, by the hour, in the night,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And soon, now, all the lights are lit,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Is there a world that I need,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
In the heart of the night?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That piece was entitled,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The Sacrilegal,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And it's kind of a celebration of spring,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
A celebration of the woods and the flowers

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
of living in spring.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We'd like you to join us in the next piece

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
in just a time of reflection.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We changed the order from the program a little bit.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We're going to Greece,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
which we'd like to be in memorial

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
to those people, those friends, relatives,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and the community who passed away in the past year.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's our last day today.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And this is our memorial for them.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:02.300
proposing

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:09.600
Oh, hÃ¡meb ho, profound renewal

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:59.400
We'd like to take note, I guess, of this last piece which was come to us courtesy of D.I.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:07.400
James Thomas, the director of the Nespi Choir, who wrote this piece and sent it to us, gosh,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.400
some year and a half ago, I believe, and said, gee, try this out if you'd like.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.400
And we've tried it out, and here it is. It's Ca' Rath B.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.400
Ca' Rath B.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.400
Ca' Rath B.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.400
Ca' Rath B.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.400
Ca' Rath B.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.400
Ca' Rath B.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:36.400
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:46.400
And the home of the brave, O'er the land of the free,

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:56.400
Hail, O'er the land of the free, Hail, O'er the land of the free,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:07.400
Hail, O'er the land of the free, Hail, O'er the land of the free,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:17.400
Hail, O'er the land of the free, Hail, O'er the land of the free,

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:27.400
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:37.400
He is the Lord and the Holy, He is the Lord,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:50.400
He is the Lord and the Holy, Alleluia!

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:26.400
Okay, everybody on the first verse, here we go.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:34.400
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.400
When the great and high Lord,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.400
God was showing me,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:53.400
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

00:11:53.400 --> 00:12:04.400
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.400
Okay, I want to do that again, the first verse, but I don't want you folks up here to sing it.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:15.400
First verse, you have to practice it.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.400
Okay, here we go.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.400
Ready?

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:27.400
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.400
When the great and high Lord,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:38.400
God was showing me,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:48.400
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

00:12:48.400 --> 00:13:01.400
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.400
When the great and high Lord,

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.400
God was showing me,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:19.400
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.400
When the great and high Lord,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.400
God was showing me,

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:40.400
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:53.400
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.400
Speaking with Reverend Price earlier,

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.400
he told me about this family that was going to this church,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.400
and he's a very caring pastor,

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.400
and this family kind of started not going to church after a while,

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:15.400
so he called up the family to express his concern to why they weren't coming to church,

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.400
and when he called up on the telephone,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.400
on the other end of the telephone there is this,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.400
Hello.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.400
And Pastor, or Reverend Price said,

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.400
Well, who's this?

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.400
It's Billy.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.400
Well, Billy, is your mom at home?

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.400
Yes.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.400
Well, can she come to the phone?

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.400
No.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.400
Well, why not?

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.400
She's busy.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.400
Well, Billy, is your dad at home?

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.400
Yes.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.400
Well, can he come to the phone?

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.400
No.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.400
Well, what about Tom?

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.400
He's busy.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.400
Well, I hear some commotion going on in the background there, Billy.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.400
Is there anybody else there?

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.400
The police.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.400
Well, Billy, can they come to the phone?

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.400
No.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.400
Well, why not?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.400
They're busy.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.400
Well, Billy, is that all that's in the house?

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.400
The fire department.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.400
Well, Billy, are any of them available?

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.400
No.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.400
Well, why not?

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.400
They're busy.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.400
Well, Billy, what is everyone doing over there?

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.400
They're looking for me.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.400
I'm sorry.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.400
I'm sorry.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:35.400
Mommy, mommy, look at that man with those terribly bold legs.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.400
And then mom said, oh, John, you've got to go to finishing school.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.400
So the next year, he wants to finish school.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.400
This is my attempt at poetry.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.400
They're walking down the same street, and that same man with the appearance came down the street,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:57.400
and this time he said to his mother, he said, mother, mother, what men are these that wear their legs in parentheses.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.400
Thank you.
