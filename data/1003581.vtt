00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let us pray.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.360
O God, we thank you for hearts to love, for voices to praise, for a fellowship that cherishes

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.160
a priceless heritage and a living hope.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.400
Accept the praise we bring, the friendships that we celebrate today.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.700
Melody our lives that every day and in every way we may live in harmony with your will

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.260
and way.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.460
To the honor of Jesus Christ, the pioneer of our faith, we pray.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.820
Amen.
