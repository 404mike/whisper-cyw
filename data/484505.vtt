00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is recording.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Excellent.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is interview number four on the Cardiff Carnival 25th anniversary project.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Interviewer is Steve Fletcher.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Interviewee is Katherine McShane.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Could you just spell your name for us please Katherine?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Yes, it's Katherine, spelled C-A-T-H-R-Y-N.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
McShane, which is M-C-S-H-A-N-E.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The interview is being recorded on the 7th of October 2014 and the venue is the Swicker office.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So Katherine, could you please tell us the history of your involvement in the Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Okey doke. Well, I started being a participant in 1996, but I actually came across Carnival a couple of years before that.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:14.000
When I first moved to Cardiff, I was out with my brother in town and the Carnival literally came across us and sort of started, well, trooping past us.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We must have been sort of in the Park Place area and I can just remember being completely wowed by it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I recognised a couple of people in the parade, a friend Kimmy and Meg dancing past with a big, I think it was a big black umbrella she had.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So then we sort of got swept away by it and sort of went up to the museum steps where the finale part of the parade was happening.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I think Benjamin Zephaniah was involved that year and there was sort of a big anti-drugs type chant going on with, don't chase the dragon, chase the something.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Repeated over and over again, but it was really high energy.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It was sort of obviously, you know, the Carnival colours and dances and it was just really lively, really enjoyed sort of being, you know, watching it and being part of the crowd and was really wowed by it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And didn't think anything of it really until a couple of years later when I met my then boyfriend Guy, who'd been a participant in the Carnival for a few years and he dragged me along to the mass camp to have a look, see what was going on and to get me involved.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So back then I was just 21 and my eldest son was three.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So we both got involved and I just really enjoyed it.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Back then it was in Cotets Community Centre and it was much more about the mass camp.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That's the part that I really enjoyed.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It was the kind of three weeks of going every day, socialising, making new friends, lots of quirky new friends, people like Keith and, you know, Marilyn Marion.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I'm trying to remember back those days, sort of those there was a big group of kids as well as parents, young people, also getting involved, sort of making things.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And back then it was, you couldn't do it now, but everyone was sort of sharing fags and having a drink, a lager, etc.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And in the community centre, obviously doesn't happen now in mass camp, but that was the sort of what it was like back then where it was sort of three weeks of almost sort of nonstop socialising and partying and making costumes at the same time.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And I also, that's the first time I ever got on stilts as well, a guy persuaded me to have a go and I never thought I would let go.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But he gave me to Kevin, who was then teaching people to do stilts and who automatically let go and made me go on my own.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And it was the scariest thing ever, but it was indoors as well.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So that was quite mad. So just tried lots and lots of different things.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And my son sort of tried lots of different things as well.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Back then, I didn't do a lot in the way of adventurous costume making.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I can remember Guy making a big Egyptian sort of dog mask thing.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Whereas Tathan, my son, was a monkey, so just needed minimal tail making, etc.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And I was a desert nomad. So again, didn't, didn't, you know, turban, smock, didn't need a lot of work.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So it was more about the socialising, having a go at different things.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And that year we were doing singing because the sections that year were sort of split into desert, sea.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I can't remember the other ones, but we were in the desert section where there were some people with kind of incredible Egyptian themed costumes

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and then others with sort of simple sort of desert type things or post apocalyptic kind of Mad Max looking kind of costumes as well.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But each section had a song that Mohammed had sort of given each section a song.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And there was me, Guy, Sally McLennan, who I'd first met there, didn't see for years again until years later.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And we've become good friends now. But and I think there might have been one other person, but it was a small group of us who were doing the singing.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But Guy neglected to tell Mohammed, who's the artistic director, that he was actually going to be on stilts.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And obviously myself and Sally were not on stilts.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So it became this big logistical problem with regard to the microphone and where we were going to be positioned.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So in the end, he managed to work something around on the museum steps where by Guy could be right at the side, a few steps below us.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And then we were we were above so we could still share one microphone.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And that year was the year of the car where Ben and his group had this sort of

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
kind of rust bucket that they were trying to turn into a mobile sound system.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And it's been weeks and weeks turning into this mobile sound system.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And our cue for the singing at the end of the parade, when our section lined up on the museum steps, was the car coming across the bottom.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And once we saw the car move into place, then we would start singing.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And it was this chant that was when I started with in the shadow of the dunes.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So they were waiting and waiting and waiting for a car which never ended up appearing.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And someone in the end, I think, ran up to us and said, just sing, just sing.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You can't get through. You can't get through because it was stuck.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I think there were some bollards or something in the way, which meant this car was never going to come through and be our cue.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But at the end of the night, it did end up being a party, a central feature in town where we all danced around it at the end in the nighttime after the parade was finished.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But I really enjoyed that year and it got me hooked.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And I wanted to participate thereon, really.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The following year was still Cotet's Community Centre.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And it's still, you know, I still see Cotet's Community Centre as being where kind of Carnival is or was, or, you know, it's still sort of the place.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
If I think Carnival, I think Cotet's Community Centre.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And that was the five senses year where there was lots of the sixth sense was added and that included lots of aliens.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
All the little boys wanted to be sort of alien things.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And I can remember David, one of the boys crossing the food in the food section, they had cupcakes and big cupcake skirts.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And David decided he wanted to be an alien jumping out of a cupcake.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So he had made this elaborate costume.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So that was the first year I started actually sort of making sort of any serious costumes.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And I was doing an alien for my little boy.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And I was with a dance group and we were red hot chilli peppers.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So I made these kind of tapered red dresses with kind of and we were printing them ourselves with kind of pepper designs.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And I was in a group with June then, June Campbell Davis and we for that year.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And I had a couple of years off then because of having babies and came back into it in 2000.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And we'd moved then. Cotet's Community Centre was no more.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So that was a bit sad. But we were at chapter here.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And that was the first year that Fred was in it.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So Fred was he's my second son and Fred was two, I think. Yeah, must have been two.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And that's sort of those the years following, I was always kind of in sections with the children rather than in a dance section,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000
but always trying to sort of do something a little bit different and do my own thing as well as herding children or herding cats.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And so that was the first year was the shaman section.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And so we did a big elaborate dressing up of a push chair for Fred.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And we sort of were all purple and white with feathers and and things.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And that year started down the bay as well, if I remember rightly, instead, because we started in Mount Stewart Primary School.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So it was a different route as well.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Again, year after we were back here in chapter and it was a low budget year, I'd say,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
where everything was made out of with these and sticky back plastic that must have got a job lot from somewhere.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And it was Ben and Jude then who were kind of helping helping the kids sort of create their own creations.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And we were in the rights of spring section and a little bit rather tough and wanted to be a dragon.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And Fred wanted to be sheep.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000
So I was then tasked with helping them create these these animals, which were then paraded.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And I decided I'd be a massive daisy.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I don't know why, but I made a kind of a winged jobby from day based on daisy flower.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And again, the following year, there was the rat racers.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:59.000
They had they they were making cars again out of sticky back plastic and each sort of individualizing their own cars to race each other.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I made this dress out of car parts, so I had sort of headlights, bra, that kind of thing and steering wheel type headpiece and various things.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I had these big flags and was trying to control lots of little boys in cars who had been told they were rat racers and wanted to race.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So but in a parade, then trying to hold them back and without them running away, it was sort of like a lot a lot of juggling, juggling with kids and sort of that.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Always good friend. And I had a similar similar problem the following year, because they were they were I was with a group of kids being airplanes.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Who again, wanted to fly all over the place, so needing to be controlled.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:00.000
But I was I'd I'd I'd done a dress that was sort of on the theme of a runway with a headpiece that was like an airplane.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So I was again trying to control lots of children, one of which was Caroline's daughter, who in the lineup informed me, I think I might be allergic to face paint scratching.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Quickly having to sort of rush to the bathroom and kind of wash everything off.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
So we had a bit of a panic attack.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So I think that that was for a sort of few years I was sort of in children's sections.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Until 2005, when it was the Blue Devils year when Spooky and Catcher came over from Trinidad and myself and Fred.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Fred was seven years old.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We just loved it.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
We went to every single workshop because we loved it.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
We just thought it was fantastic.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
The whole sort of well, spooky and his kind of menacing presence and the whole dance.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
We just loved it.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:03.000
We went to every single one because we thought we would, you know, we were really taken by the kind of Blue Devils concept.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And I think that was probably one of my favourite parades despite pouring rain because obviously the costume involves very little clothing,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
but being head to toe in blue body paint.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And I think that was one of my favourite parades despite pouring rain because obviously the costume involves very little clothing,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:40.000
but being head to toe in blue body paint with some horns, a tail, maybe a pitchfork.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Did we have wings? We must have had wings. We must have had some blue wings as well.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
But mostly it was being painted head to foot in blue.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
That's the costume.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And of course, that year it poured with rain.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It was chucking it down.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And I can remember going through the bay because the parade went through the bay that year and it pouring with rain that with the body paint running off us

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:20.000
because we were going from blue to green and then swicker volunteers kind of running up with big buckets of body paint.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
So we could splash it over us again and sort of keep touching up and keep touching up.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
But it was like running off us and the street was running with like blue water.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:38.000
But it was really good fun. It was really good fun kind of because it was the first year really of trying to...

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Previously, I think in the parades we'd been sort of entertaining people,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
but with the Blue Devils you're actually trying to scare people and sort of shock and surprise.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And so it was a really different way to play carnival.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000
So it was kind of jumping at people, kind of being menacing, kind of making babies cry.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.000
It was there was a really different sort of style of carnival from what we'd been sort of doing in the years leading up to that.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So it was really good fun.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And plus, I think that year was the first year I met Kath Leggett and we were Blue Devils together and we were being very naughty.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And we did have a little bit of a drink to keep out the cold before we started, which helped in keeping us going.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And we just had such a ball that year kind of running around and yes, causing trouble.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And Fred Levim, he really enjoyed it that year as well because, you know, how can you go wrong?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Kind of little boys with pitchforks, you know, they had a great time.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
The following year, I made a bit of a mistake costume wise.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I'd been asked whether myself and the boys wanted to be in a big Chinese dragon costume, which was in separate sections, but joined together.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And I found that one really restricting because I've always liked sort of playing, dancing with the crowd and sort of, yeah, just doing my own thing.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Whereas that year just felt a bit tied in and a bit, yeah, very restricted in my movement.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
So I kind of decided at that point that I'd never do a massive costume again.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
My eldest son Tathland started doing steel pans that year as well.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And he kind of he sort of carried on doing that for a few years with with them Rocco until he kind of got to the sort of teenage age where he didn't you know, he didn't want to dress up anymore.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
He was sort of sort of I think the last parade he did was part of it.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Let me have a look. I think it was in 2007.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And as soon as the parade finished, he whipped off his costume, threw it at me and sort of like ran off to join the big weekend with his friends.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:20.000
You know, so I thought, yeah, I don't think he's going to be doing it again until he's kind of grown out of that and comes back as a sort of as a grown up.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:32.000
But the following year after that was the first year that Aylir, my youngest son, was involved because Aylir was born in 2005.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
So he was a spectator in the crowd 2005, 2006 and then 2007.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:46.000
He joined for the first time and he and myself were dancing diseases.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And it was the theme. The theme was linked to the anniversary of the abolition of slavery so that we represented the disease that sort of had wiped out so many people.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Fred was in a different section as a bloodhound with Bud.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
They joined up together and they were bloodhounds again being menacing and naughty in the crowd.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
So, you know, suits suits both both both them.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
But Aylir did love him. He did the whole thing on foot.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
No push chair this time. It was just him on foot and apart from a little bit of carrying now and again.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
But he was hooked from from from the off and he's never missed the carnival since.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
So from that year, he's been in it every year.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
The year after that was the first dragon section within the carnival, which became a recurring theme.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
And myself and Aylir were dragons.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
And I can remember making so many dragon masks.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
So it was a bit of a production line that year because it was quite a big section.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
But there were quite a few first time participants who didn't really know what they were doing.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:07.000
So I ended up sort of well with Caroline making sort of 10 head pieces in a row for various people.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
So I made a lot of dragon head pieces that year.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
And and then the following year was the year that everyone was a dragon.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
It was the Here Be Dragons Carnival.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000
But that year we were I was in what was the sort of start of what's now Carnival Crew.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
So we had our own dragon section.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
But Aylir wasn't part of that group.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:48.000
So it meant that I had to ask my husband, Rickson, to be part of the carnival and to be with Aylir

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000
because Aylir really, really wanted to join in and be involved, but couldn't do it on his own.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
And so by default, Rickson had to be in it.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And he wasn't interested in making costumes or anything like that.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
So I had to make all the costumes and he just turned up on the day.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
But really, really enjoyed himself once he did it.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
And he's done it every year since.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:25.000
But on the basic stipulation that I make him a costume and the costume has to make him anonymous.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:34.000
So either some sort of mask or headpiece that sort of hides his identity.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:45.000
And once he's hidden, he's quite happy to kind of play a role and be a full part of the carnival.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
So all dragons.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
But from my participation then in that initial dragon carnival group,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
I got asked and invited to join Samba Galez's dance group.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.000
So from that year onwards, I've always been part of the Samba Galez dance group, which is great.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
But it's sort of more choreographed compared to what I was doing before.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
I always danced in the carnival, but not in a choreographed way.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Whereas now I'm in a group where it's structured and choreographed.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Quite high energy.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000
We've done lots of parades in the rain since then, which sometimes is welcome to us

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000
because we've got really hot and bothered dancing and then we can cool off in the rain.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000
I've also started making since then, making bigger and bigger costumes every year

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
because as Ayler has grown up, he's become more and more demanding and more creative in his thinking

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
with regards to what he'd like to be.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
For years, he talks about being a turtle.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
So the first year that there was an Anything Goes theme,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I said, all right, then you can be a turtle.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
But I hadn't a clue where to start with making a turtle.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
But luckily, again, I'd met people at carnival camp.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.000
There was Jude, who does a lot of basket weaving, who helped me with the shell for the turtle.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.400
And also Ray, who helped me with the

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.400
actually sort of making a frame and a backpack for Ayler.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.400
So that was the first massive costume that I made.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:46.400
And then every year since then, Ayler has got bigger and better ideas of what he wants to be.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.400
So the following year was a rain cloud.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:54.400
And then last year was a massive, this year rather, was a massive rain cloud.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.400
He wanted sort of almost like a totem pole of African masks, as you do.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:04.400
So he'd researched it, found the types of masks he'd wanted on the Internet.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:11.400
So again, it was this big challenge to try and sort of match Ayler's vision

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:16.400
and what I could make in the three weeks available with the results.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.400
And then he was able to do that.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.400
And so that was the first big challenge.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.400
And then last year was a massive,

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.400
I think, big challenge to try and match Ayler's vision

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.400
and what I could make in the three weeks available with the results available.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.400
And I think we did a pretty good job.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.400
But I'm dreading what he comes up with next year.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.400
Because it's just going to be, oh no, what next?

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.400
I think it's in terms of emphasis, I suppose.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:55.400
I think I started off, it was more of a go along for a social.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.400
And I had no experience of making anything at all, really.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.400
And in the first years I didn't really make much.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.400
Or I followed other people's instructions.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.400
If someone told me to print this there, then I did that.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.400
Or stick this there.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.400
I just followed orders, as it were.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:19.400
Whereas now I do a lot more of my own design and making work

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.400
with a bit of support from those who know what will fall over

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.400
and what won't fall over, or what materials I should be using

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.400
and what I shouldn't.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.400
But otherwise, a lot of the making I do myself,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.400
and the bigger and better.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.400
Also, obviously I started off with singing.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.400
Did a little bit of dance.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.400
Then was mostly in kid sections.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.400
Whereas now I'm back to what I wanted to do originally,

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.400
which was dance.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.400
But then the making for the rest of the family,

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.400
so that they can participate as well.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.400
So yeah, it's changed over the years.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.400
But I'd thoroughly recommend it.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.400
It's the high point of the summer every year.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:13.400
Kath McShane with an impressive 17 Cardiff Carnivals under your belt.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.400
I wish to formally declare for posterity,

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.400
you are indeed a Cardiff Carnival hero.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.400
Thank you very much.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.400
Thank you.
