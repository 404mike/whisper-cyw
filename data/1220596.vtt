00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Do you have memories of going to the synagogue when you were a young child?

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.720
Oh yes.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.720
What are the memories that stand out for you most?

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.640
Sort of sitting in the pews.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:23.480
It was a typical traditional style synagogue with a balcony.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.560
Very, very old.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.240
And completely traditional.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.680
And they had their own rabbi there who had a wonderful voice.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:50.720
And again, one of the things outstanding memories is the fact that the Salvation Army were next

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.720
door.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.440
When they played, you could hear them playing in the synagogue.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:15.240
On one occasion, part of the ceremony, it's where the reader falls down on his knees and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.360
unfortunately fell and caught his head on the corner.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.840
The outcome being that he was killed.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.680
I was sent running down to the doctors, who was a Jewish doctor, who was just a matter

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.360
of a few hundred yards away.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.280
And that sticks out in my memory.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.280
I'm not surprised.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.200
How old would you have been then?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.720
I suppose about eight to ten.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:56.080
Are there any festivals or holy days that stick in your mind?

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.240
Well yes.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.200
The New Year and the Day of Atonement were the main ones.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.640
Festival of Lights, Chanukah.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.640
These are joyous ones.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.640
No, those are the ones that stick out anyway.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.640
So you went to Hader, but at the other synagogue?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640
At the other synagogue, yes.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.640
And how were you received there?

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.640
Oh, fine.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.640
Because all the children went there from you?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640
Yes, yes, yes.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.640
So you had your bar mitzvah at your own synagogue, but you were...

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.640
No, no, because by the time my bar mitzvah had come around, I believe the other one had

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.640
closed.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.640
OK.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.640
So that would have been early 50s?

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.640
Yes, early 50s.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.640
So your bar mitzvah was in the newer building?

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:10.640
No, it was a temporary building that we hired because the main synagogue had been bombed

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.640
in the wall.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.640
OK.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.640
That was called Goat Street.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.640
Goat Street was bombed in what, 1941 or something?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640
41, 42.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.640
So you would have been very young then, just a few years old, but can you remember what

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.640
happened after Goat Street was bombed?

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:42.640
Yes, they then moved to...not Union Street, Costina Street, where they took a building

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.640
over.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.640
They had there a mikvah and a killing pen for chickens.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640
Right.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:01.640
And on a Sunday it was my job to pick up the chickens for the family, which made me feel

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.640
very sick.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.640
After they'd been killed?

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640
Yes, yes.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.640
And what, your mum had to prepare them then?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.640
Yes.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.640
OK.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.640
So the mikvah and the killing place was used by both synagogues?

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.640
I wouldn't mind.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.640
There was only one mikvah that I'm aware of.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.640
No, the other one.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.640
I honestly can't answer that.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.640
OK.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.640
It's something I didn't partake of.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.640
Would you have known what the burial arrangements were for each of the synagogues?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.640
Oh, there was no, just one...

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.640
Just one burial ground.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.640
One burial ground.
