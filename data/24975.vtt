00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Track 6. The Oak gave you a warning.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm often down in Machynlleth, you know. There's the cinema, of course, and the stables at the Red Lion.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
One of my favourite jobs was toothing the timber.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I used to collect one of the horses from there, big old mare she was,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we'd spend the day pulling all the fallen timber out of the woods.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Not long after, they started using a tractor.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Betty was the one for that. She'd change the oil, clean the cabaretta,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and even fix it when it broke down, quite often, as I recall.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
She's married now, left the land army, of course.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Nowadays, I'm responsible for dispatch.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Most of the timber goes off on lorries from the woods to Machynlleth.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's either taken to the railway station where I then go down to dispatch 12, 14,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
sometimes 16 trucks from the station, or to the two sawmills.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We all fought to work in there, of course.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You were allowed to cut up the wastebark using a small electric saw,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
bag it up and sell it as firewood.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
There isn't much wood wasted.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The birch goes for brush backs, you know, scrubbing brushes,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
ash for axe handles, poplar for matches,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
alder for clog backs and the oak.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Well, that goes mainly to the mines in South Wales.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The South Wales miners won't have softwood pit props

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
because the oak gives you a warning, a creak before it gives.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Wasn't as cheap, mind.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Perhaps that's why the Midland miners had the softwood.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Either way, I'm glad us girls don't have to go down the pits.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We developed quite a technique for stacking the pit props in sleepers.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
With a girl on each end, we'd swing them back and forth

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and release them on top of each other.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We coped quite well with the softwoods, the oak ones on the other hand.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Come on, let's head down to the river now.
