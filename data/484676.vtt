00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880
This is Aileen Richin interviewing Rikson Richin for the Swigga 25th anniversary Cardiff

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.800
Carnival Heritage Project. It is the 13th of November and we are in Penelan in Cardiff.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.760
Rikson, please could you spell your name for the recording?

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.760
My first name?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.760
Yes.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.640
Rikson, spell R-I-X-O-N.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.760
What can you remember about the first get involved in the Cardiff Carnival?

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:49.680
What can I remember about first getting involved? I think it was 2003. I got involved because

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.680
my wife had been involved for quite a few years prior to that and I think probably a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.080
couple of years prior to that she'd suggested I get involved but I wasn't so sure because

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.240
I'd never really done anything like that before. But I was quite interested in the idea of

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:16.560
doing steel pans. So the first year I did it I went, I did I think it was classes once

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.520
a week for a few weeks or a couple of times a week to do steel pans and then actually

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.080
in the carnival I was part of the steel pan section. So that's I guess that's my first

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.560
memory. Although my first I guess my first memory is watching it.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.960
What is it about the carnival that keeps you being involved?

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.880
It's just fun. On the day it's good fun. I must admit I don't do an awful lot. I don't

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.760
get involved too much prior to the actual event. My wife does all the costume making

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.720
so I pretty much just turn up on the day. It's just good fun. It's very different. It's

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.320
a different thing for me to do. I guess I'm quite a shy person generally so it's not something

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.520
I would normally do. But it's kind of it's an alter ego for me. So once a year I get

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.160
to do something that's quite different for me.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.680
How many carnival have you been involved in?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:39.560
I know this because I've made a record. So I've been in seven. First one was in 2003.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.680
Then there was a gap and I've been in every year since 2009.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.960
What is the gap?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.920
I don't know. I think there was a lot whilst I really enjoyed the steel pan there was a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:04.720
lot of involvement. At that time I guess I wasn't that keen to do a section involving

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:15.920
around. But then when you got bigger and you went in the carnival on your own I thought

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.000
I'd join in with you. That's what kind of got me back involved really.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
How are the carnivals different?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.920
I guess they're different in different ways. Obviously there's a different theme every

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:42.080
year. So that changes it. The routes have changed quite a lot. The venues have changed.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.880
The route probably changes the experience of doing it quite a lot I think. There's been

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.880
bits added every year. There's a static section. You do a lot of walking but then there's lots

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.640
of static bits as well. But for me I guess what makes it different every year is the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.160
costumes and the outfits.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.880
What was your experience of the carnival camp?

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.120
Experience of the carnival camp? I must admit I haven't been that involved in the last few

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:27.720
years although when I first started I did used to go down. But it's just difficult for

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.520
me now to really get involved in the carnival camp. But my experience of it is a positive

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.520
one. People are very friendly. It's quite good fun. It's just difficult to find the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.240
time to do it.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.200
Can you remember music and dance being involved?

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:59.480
I think the music and the dance are the most important things for me. I like dancing. There's

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.000
a kind of freedom that you get in being part of the carnival that I think is difficult

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.600
to replicate elsewhere. I like the fact that you can put an outfit on. I wear lots of masks

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
so I can hide myself a little bit so I can create a character and maybe be a bit more

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:31.000
like I'd like to be. But I guess I find it more difficult in everyday life. I like being

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
able to dance around quite a lot.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Obviously you remember music as you said in the steel pans earlier. What was your most

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.400
memorable carnival incident?

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.400
I don't know really. I'm not sure if I've got a single incident. I guess I'm probably

00:05:50.400 --> 00:06:03.400
in it every year because I enjoy it every year. For me it's probably the outfits. On

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.400
the day it makes a big difference who you've got in terms of the band. Which band you've

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.800
got in front of you and which band behind you. So that makes a big difference in terms

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:21.800
of how much fun it is. But yeah I think it's probably the outfits. Just kind of dancing

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.800
around and mucking around with people. So I don't think it's a single moment. It's

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.800
lots of different moments.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.800
What do you recall about taking part in the parade?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.800
What do you recall about taking part in the parade?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.800
What do I enjoy?

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.800
What do you recall?

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.800
What do I recall?

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:05.800
I probably recall the outfits more than anything. I recall getting very wet on occasion. But

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.200
that just being part of the fun.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.200
So what is your favourite outfit?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:25.200
My favourite outfit was probably the 2010 Cosmic Tech Couch. It was a Terminator outfit.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:33.200
It was a cross between a bit like Terminator from the movie Terminator. It was a bit of

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.600
a Roman skirt. So that was probably my favourite outfit. But I've had lots of different outfits

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:50.600
across the years. Last year was the Hellrealm Demon which was a character from the Buddhist

00:07:50.600 --> 00:08:01.600
Wheel of Life, Tanker. I've been Davy Jones from a kind of Davy Jones like character.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I've been a Blue Devil, a Lightning Man, Dragon with you. So every year I've got a different

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
mask and all my masks are on the wall of the house. So everyone that comes into the house

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
every time they go up and down the stairs they can see the masks.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
What is your favourite part of Carnival involvement?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Probably just the very friendly atmosphere that you get.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And what elements do you find least enjoyable?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Least enjoyable? I don't know if there is a least enjoyable part. Actually usually, even

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
though you're tired at the end, because you've been dancing around and engaging with the

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:03.400
crowd. I do a lot of dancing and mucking around and engaging with the crowd quite a lot. So

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:10.400
when it's over, that's probably the least engaging part of it really. When it's over,

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.400
when it ends.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.400
How do you feel the crowd reacted?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:24.400
I think mostly good. I think some people were a bit shy and a bit unsure about how to react.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:31.800
I wear my masks because I like to interact with the crowd quite a lot. I've never had

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:44.800
a negative reaction. People don't necessarily know how to react, but people are clearly

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.800
having a good time. So I think it's a positive one. It always surprised me how many people

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.200
turn out actually to watch it.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.200
What is that?

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.200
I don't know. I'm just surprised. There's always so many people out on the route watching

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.200
it, regardless of the weather. It's always jam-packed.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.200
What changes have you seen in the Carnival over time?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:18.200
I guess the probably biggest changes have been the routes. But I guess also it used

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:25.600
to be part of the big weekend. It's probably a shame that it's not associated with that

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.600
anymore to some degree because I think it lost something a little bit.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.600
Whilst it's big enough as an event to stand on its own, I think it's a shame that the

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:44.600
council decided to pull funding from it and it lost its connection with that because I

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
think they gave it a slightly larger stage for it really.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
What do you think the value of Carnival is?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Probably that it brings people together.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
What is that?

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:15.400
Not just the participants, but there is a real sense of togetherness on the day. You

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.400
never see any trouble or problems. People seem to be enjoying themselves and there's

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.400
a very relaxed atmosphere.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.400
After the Carnival experience is over, how do you feel?

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.400
A mixture of exhilarated because you've been dancing around and often in the rain.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.400
Tired, but then usually a bit disappointed that it's all over.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.400
Thank you.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.400
You're welcome.
