00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
I'm Vicki MacDonald and I'm at Holy Trinity Church in London now for the exhibition of

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.520
The Longest Yarn and I have Gwyneth Peters with me and she's going to talk about her

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.400
childhood in Anglesey during the wartime.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400
Thank you Gwyneth.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.400
Right.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.400
My name was Gwyneth Brown.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:23.280
I was born and brought up in Hollyhead where I was born in 1935 at which time during the

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:31.360
war my father was away with Trinity House and clearing the mines, following the minesweepers,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:42.240
but we had the army in Tee-Croix, we had the Royal Air Force in Valley and we had the Navy

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.240
in Hollyhead and there was a barrage, I remember the barrage balloons floating up high to stop

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.480
the Germans bombing.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.280
So I was brought up on going along the seashore looking for tins of flour, the sweetened flour

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.280
that came from the Canadian ships that had been torpedoed on the way to Liverpool.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.840
My father being a seaman, he used to bring home seagull's eggs and we used to look for

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.400
this sweetened flour and we would have pancakes.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.720
And was the sweetened flour in good condition?

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.080
In cans, in good condition in cans, yes.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.920
The other interesting thing that was from each of the ships in the harbour in Hollyhead,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.720
there were barrage balloons and my mother kept having little babies when my father came

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.800
home from war and she wanted something waterproof to put in the cot.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.640
So when the barrage balloons were blown up by enemy fire, you could use this material

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.000
from the barrage balloons to use as waterproofing for putting underneath the sheet in the baby's

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.520
cot.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.280
So that was one thing.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.680
The other thing I remember is going to Rosneiger and where the RAF camp was and we used to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.720
go to their rubbish heap looking for food scraps and I think we did find a necklace

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.160
one time, some beads, but if we saw the Americans we'd say, got any gum, chum?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.200
And that's what we would, and sometimes they would give us some chewing gum and if you

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.040
know we didn't have sweets and all that because there was so many Russians.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.400
So and the other thing, did I mention that my father used to bring home seagulls eggs?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.840
Yes and you had pancakes.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.120
And we had pancakes.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.040
I know you've mentioned seagull eggs before.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.280
What do they taste like Gwyneth?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.480
I don't know, I can't remember because I was born in 35.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.400
So you know I was only 10 when the war finished wasn't I?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.360
They must have tasted slightly fishy.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.720
Probably.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.520
But I was so used to eating winkles.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.320
Winkles and don't eat dog whelks, they're not very good.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.520
And you have to cook them with nettles.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.680
And I didn't realize until I studied botany at university that the Latin name for nettle

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.600
is urticaria and the disease on my face was called urticaria but it was because I was

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.960
eating winkles cooked with net stinging nettles.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.920
So were your your father was at sea then?

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.560
He was at sea.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.120
During the war?

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.440
Yeah.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.760
And your mother was left with how many of you at home?

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.280
Well the first one was born in 33.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:44.400
My brother Gwilym was born in 1933 and she had Gwyneth 35, Eileen 37, Gilbert 1940, Avril 1942,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.840
and then the poor woman thought that she was all passed it all and in 1949 she had her sixth child

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.560
David who still lives in and my three brothers were all apprentices to be marine engineers

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.760
so they went around the world.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:07.520
But the sad thing that my mother's brother Eddie was a flying officer and he'd been on a sortie in

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.160
Italy and coming back to south of England he was shot down by friendly fire

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.400
and it was they thought that it was a German airplane but it was in fact

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.000
Was he killed?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And he was killed and he was a golf professional in Chester.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.080
I lost my cousin but it all said lost at sea.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.520
He was my cousin also my father was William Robert Brown he was William Robert Brown

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:45.360
and then I had one of my mother's brothers was lieutenant colonel and he was very involved in

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:56.960
the army so we lost my father's brother my father's nephew and my mother's brother in the war.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.320
So that was very sad.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.800
Very sad.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.360
Yes.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.920
But my

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.280
Very difficult for your mother.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.840
Yeah very difficult for my mother and she had to you know live off

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.920
all because rushing but the interesting thing about my husband he was an only child

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:19.280
living in London and he was somewhere by Clapham or something like that and his father and mother

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.400
were both on warden duty for the bombs and he was in his pajamas and house got bombed

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.440
and his mother did manage to rush and say get under the stairs.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.720
He was found under the stairs in his pajamas by a policeman who took him to the vicarage

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.160
where they had a bundle of clothes on the floor said take some clothes but he had no shoes

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.960
but it was the eve of his 11 plus exam and he had been told you have a little pencil

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.600
and a protractor and if you come to school without the pencil and protractor you can't

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.880
do the 11 plus.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.960
So he's been found by this policeman and he was taking him for the clothes he says please don't

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.800
leave me to the policeman because that's my 11 plus exam and the teacher won't let me in if I

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.400
don't have my protractor and pencil.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.960
So the policeman stayed with him and true enough went to the primary school and the teacher

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.280
immediately said get out you can't come in here you haven't got your pencil or your protractor

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.240
and the policeman grabbed it by the shoulder and said this child was born at two o'clock in the

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.600
morning under the stairs he doesn't know where his parents are give him a pencil and a protractor

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.600
and he concentrated so much on passing that 11 plus he did pass.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.760
He passed it down with his parents okay?

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.720
They took three days.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.240
But they did find him.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.280
They did find him his mother's face was even to she died when she was 83 or something her

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.840
face is still speckled with the black thing from the the bombing and she had a great big

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.080
hole in the calf of her leg from where she had been injured during the bombing but his father

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.080
went to a Iraq petroleum company and so they had no more children they had a divorce.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.720
So but it's interesting.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.200
Yes what an interesting story Gwena thank you so much that's so kind of you.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.440
I really appreciate your stories thank you.
