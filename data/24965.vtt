00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Track two, I think all the best ones must be soldiers.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Hello there. Have you seen Mr Evans up here? There's still a fair bit to do, even though the war is over.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Nonetheless, I'm not sure how much work there is for us lumberjills these days.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We've played our part, you know. It's already starting to look different since I came in 42.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It was a glorious summer's day. We had some laughs over the last three years, but it's not been easy.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm lucky, really. Most of the land girls are English and can't speak a word of Welsh.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Still, it's been a bit of a shock for me, having grown up in Bangor.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I think the locals, especially the wives, have been a bit wary of us too.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Thought we were going to steal their men.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Although, between you and me, I think all the best ones must be soldiers.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I can understand it, but we were only here to do our bit, in the country's hour of need and all that.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm very proud of what we've achieved.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
When I first came here, I did all the usual forestry labour work, you know, cutting timber, burning the brash,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and even did a bit in the sawmill and nursery here.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now they've got me in the office, which is a promotion, so they say.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm loist, by the way.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I've got to head off into the mountain later to measure some of the trees at Blaen Glesyrch,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
just north of here on the other side of the road.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The Home Guard have already been in there once to measure up for the pit props,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but as they say, if you want a job doing properly, if you want to join me,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I can show you what what, if you'd like. Come along.
