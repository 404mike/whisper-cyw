WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
There's still a little Jewish content.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.240
Of residents?

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.240
Yeah.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.120
Maybe six, seven, I don't know.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.120
I'm not honestly sure.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.120
I don't think there's more than that.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.800
Do they still have services there?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.800
They do.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.800
They do.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.040
We've got our Jewish New Year coming up in two weeks' time, and they'll have one day

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.520
service in the home, and one day's in the synagogue.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.980
And they try and do the other festivals.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.820
They try and do one day in the home, and one day in the synagogue, which is a bit of

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.380
a boner contempt because it splits the community, and we haven't got enough people to fill one

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.420
area, do you know what I mean?

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.340
But that is what it is.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.620
And they do Friday night dinners as well, in the home as well, which is nice for the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.020
Jewish residents who are there, the Sabbath.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.380
You were telling me when we met before that you can vlog with Midsford, though.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.380
Oh yeah.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.380
Yeah.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.860
And this is now taking, suddenly I had a meeting a couple of days ago for Midsford Day.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.500
This is what I call Good Deed Day.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.060
And you can have it any time, but we always have it in November because this is when,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.460
I think it's November the 16th this year, when we pick a day and it's all over the country.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.940
People do their own things.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.220
It's not for raising money, it's for doing good deeds, helping others.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.220
And Cardiff being a small community, we find it difficult, but I run clothes, collecting

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.220
clothes.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.340
Andrew, who goes out on a Thursday night into town every Thursday, like for the last 30

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.660
years, he goes out at 11, he comes back at 5.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.820
I've been on these trips with him.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.740
And he serves food and gives clothes, warm clothes to the street people on the streets.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.540
And it's unbelievable.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.540
Unbelievable.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.740
You wouldn't think that, and it's troubled, when I went, which was about a year ago, he

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.820
said it's troubled in the amount of people there now.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.060
Very, very, very, and people from all walks of life.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.820
They're not necessarily just drug addicts or alcoholics.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.340
There's people who have fallen on hard times or families have gone and they're left.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.180
It's quite sad.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.740
Quite sad to see these people.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.700
So I make sure everybody, we send out notices that they collect all their old clothes, or

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.460
not ever new clothes, that they don't want winter things.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.460
It's always in the winter.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.340
And they either bring them to me or take them straight to Andrew, drop them at the synagogue,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.980
and then I collect.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.340
But now we've actually got, we had a meeting a couple of days ago and we are, there's a

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.620
couple of other people and myself, and we're trying to broaden it a bit now.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.020
And what we've decided, we're doing Mitzvah Day, Good Day Day, with interfaith.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.980
Not just with the Jewish religion, but doing it with all the religions.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.860
So we've got a meeting coming up in September and emails have been sent out to the different

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.340
leaders and people of the different faiths.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:13.260
The Sikhs, Muslims, the, I'm dealing with the Welsh Chapel because my son-in-law's uncle

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.780
is a minister in the Welsh Chapel.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.540
Mormons, because they're very good at sorting things out and that, and Catholic faith.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.380
So we want to try and get a meeting all together with everybody around the table.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.380
This will probably take place in the synagogue.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.900
And we'll get ideas together and see what people from other faiths feel like they'd

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.900
like to do.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.900
So that's just happened in the last couple of days.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.900
So that's a bit early.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.900
So just what the response is going to be for that?

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.900
A bit early.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.500
They may say, hang on, no, we're not interested in any of that, you know, but I'm trying to

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.740
get Andrew along so that he can say what he does when he goes out on a Thursday night.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.460
And there might be people, they do, but I think they sort of collect in a different

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.340
way, you know, their good deeds.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.820
But we'll see what it brings forth.
