00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Yn y ffordd, mae gennym ni yn recordio.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Yn y ffordd, mae gennym ni yn recordio.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Felly, roeddwn i'n cymryd fy hun yn Paul Hunt a'n gweithio ar Mencap Cymru.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Mae ym mhen i'r 21 o octobr 2020 a'i gael ymlaen 12.30 yn y blynyddoedd.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A allwch chi ddynnu'r ffordd?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm Helen. Marni, I work for Mencap as well and I work for Mencap.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
My name is Richard Goodfellow and I volunteer at a charity shop in Aberdeck called Barnardo's but it's currently closed at the moment due to the pandemic.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And what's your connection with each other?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We are fiancees.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I know we will have covered this in the previous interview but could you just remind people who might be listening to this how long you've been engaged and how long you've been together?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We've been together about four years now in February and we got engaged last year.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You're on next Wednesday?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Yes.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So how have you both found the last seven months?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The first couple of months we didn't ever see each other, did we Richard?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
No we didn't.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We were able to keep in contact through Skype and video calling and things and phone of course.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So why didn't you, was it just the lockdown?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It was, we were locked down, I think we were confused what we could see and don't think we were allowed to see outside.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Yes.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
A little tickler time.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But then when it got a bit easier we were going out for walks.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Yes.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Every day.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
A source of this to meet us.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Yep.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Then when we were there we were able to go and stay in your house when we went.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Yes, when the bubble started.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So you bubbled with each other did you?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Yes.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And how did you find that after a few months away from each other, what was it like seeing each other in person for the first time?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Relief.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Yes, it was pure joy.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Joy.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And what did you miss about being apart when you couldn't see each other?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
What?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It was the company really wasn't it?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Yes, I think company mostly.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Yes.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Attempting not to kill each other but if you know what I mean Paul.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I know what you mean, I'm married.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Watching the same programmes, laughing at things, I think we mostly missed as well.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Yes.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And talking to each other.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Yep.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Forgive me if you don't want to answer this but when you stayed at each others homes did you stay in the same bedroom, in the same bed?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Yes, didn't we Ed?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Yes.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Was there any aspect of that that you missed in the months that you weren't together?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
No.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
When I say no it's the snoring part of it Paul.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You're a snorer Richard.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Yes, unfortunately.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Rather than that I did miss it about the snoring.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We did miss each other apart from the snoring part.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And you say companionship, is it different do you think than just talking to each other over the internet?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Yes, definitely.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Can you tell me in what way it's different for you?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It's like when you can see someone on screen you can't always, how can I put this, it's the physicality of not having somebody near to you or next to you.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I agree with that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Yeah.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Where do you both live at the moment?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
At the moment we're apart.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I live on my own.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And I live with my parents.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Richard, do you live on your own completely or do you have any support coming in?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I do have support but not from my parents. My father missed them, I live across the road from me to the few doors up.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So they're there if I ever need them and they've been absolutely fantastic.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So when the first lockdown happened in March Richard, did you stay on your own?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I did, yeah, we were talking on the doorsteps and short distances.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And how did you find that apart from obviously missing Helen, how did you find just being on your own for that amount of time?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Up and down.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Sometimes I felt OK most of the time because I knew they were only a phone call away order, I could talk on the doorstep to them.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But when things got easier then we were able to meet outside, I was able to go and see them in the garden.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And that was OK and that was good.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Was there anything you enjoyed about not being able to go anywhere or do anything?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000
That's a tricky one.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I can't answer that I'm afraid Paul.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Well that's fine and Helen you live with your parents?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Yeah.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
How did you find being around them?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I didn't mind because I felt it brought us a bit closer because sometimes I don't see them all the time.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
That's wrong because I just stay with them once a week before lockdown.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
But it seemed to have brought us closer because I've seen them all day now.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
When I even worked at home I wasn't living with them.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So if I was stuck on bits of work, they were always there.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Mam can you let me with this or Dad?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
But I don't know what I would cope with if I was living on my own mind.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It would probably be a bit different.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I suppose if I was all living on my own I would have to move back in because I don't think I would cope living on my own like Richard.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Did you ever both consider moving in with each other for the lockdown?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
No.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
No.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Because not long beginning to lockdown my father went back into hospital so I thought it wasn't a risk.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000
You know that he wasn't as, I suppose it was serious but he didn't have a heart attack.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It was his heart that was at.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But if I wanted to go and see him it was really high risk of the Covid going back to him when he came out of hospital.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So it was that way of dodgy.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Yeah and he was risky so we wouldn't take the risk.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
No that's fair enough.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So on top of everything else, Helen you had your father being a bit under the weather.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Yeah.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So how did you find all of that?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So you didn't visit him in hospital or anything?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
No I couldn't. My mother and my sister took him in.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Luckily we got good doctors, really good doctors.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And he went to an appointment on a Monday, he was in on a Tuesday.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And they took him over, I wasn't with them, but they took him through the door and they weren't allowed to go through the hospital.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
They were only allowed to go into a certain type of ward I think.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And left him there for about two weeks.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And we were only watching what we were doing now on Skype or FaceTime etc.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And that's what we did every day.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
But a totally odd and totally easy way of visiting.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Did you find that? How did you find that emotionally having your father in for two weeks and not being able to see him?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Hard.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Especially now, I say now I've grown up.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I've never really left him in hospital.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Since he was 71, so since he's 70 he's bad.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
It's a hard problem.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And the only time I've left him for longer is when he had a two day pass.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I didn't see him.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I was told by my father, do not come and see me, it won't be well.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:11.000
But as long as seeing him not being with me in the house was already emotionally difficult.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Because when he was in having his pacemaker removed and the right witred, when I left him I got in the lift and cried.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Yes you did.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Because I'd never have left him in hospital.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And did Richard, you and Helen talk about that when it was happening?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Yes, we did, we spoke a lot didn't we?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Yes.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And with friends as well.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
We liked friends.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Sometimes they've had a difficult moment and they would support me.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Yes.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Which is good actually.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So thinking about your friends, have you managed to stay in touch with them?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Yes, very much.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Mostly every day.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Either text or the semen for example, we are doing the Skype.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Yes.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And then we'd say two or three months in a bit and we'd start doing quizzes.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Yes we did, we started doing quizzes now and it's been really enjoyable.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
It keeps your brain in gear.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Which I do the quizzes really, I don't take part, I just do the quiz.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Helen's quiz master.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And then we met through lockdown now with another friend called Richard.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Which we did, well you've met him before haven't you Rich?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Yes, but you haven't actually met him in the fresh sort have you?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
No, but at the moment to me that's his meeting.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
We met new friend called David through Richard and other friend.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So we've had a bigger group meeting, Skype-ing which is very good fun.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So that thing you've got tonight, who are those friends?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Where did you meet them? Obviously before lockdown I presume.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Well one is very much before lockdown.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Kerry our friend we've met in primary school.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And even though it isn't particularly a miniature story really,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000
that we'd had a huge gap of not meeting Kerry because he had moved on to a different school

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and I was in primary and I went on to a different school in the camp.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So it was about the same time, how many years was that Rich?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I think about the same time as we were, about 12, 13 years gap not meeting each other.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Even though we didn't get to meet each other in the street at the time,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
it wasn't like this.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I met Alby through Richard.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And they were the same.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
But Kerry was from primary school.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Yep.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And so what kind of things did you do with them before lockdown?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
We used to go out didn't we?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000
We had plans to go and see the Mrs Brown's boys in June.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Yeah.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But that's gone.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Yeah that was pushed back to next year.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Hopefully, fingers crossed.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Yes, let's hope so.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We're big fans of it.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And this new friend David, where did you meet him?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
He was through Alby wasn't he Rich?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Yeah I met him through Alby a few years back.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000
We lost touch for a while but then he started joining us on Skype for chats and we've got friendly again.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Where's he from?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Penderyn.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Okay, so still near you.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Yeah.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I'm thinking, are you members of any groups at all before all of this?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I was in a choir called Martinash Coal Society.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And has that choir continued to meet online?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
No.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It's about 90 odd of us.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I doubt we will be on a choir and get on the Skype.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
But when we had a conference last week, there were 400-500 people on it.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
So we suppose we could.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
But most of them are not very much technically minded I suppose.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
You've had emails from the chairwoman, asking how everybody was and all that.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Yeah.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Is there anyone from choir that you miss seeing regularly?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
I'm awesome. We all have a very good friendship with all of them.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And one of the choir members was my school teacher in Llanwell.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So we're really making great friends now.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
We miss him a lot.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I think we're missing all, we call it a family I suppose.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
It's like choir family.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Yeah, we just miss genuinely socialising with them during the choir and then after the choir.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
We miss the social part of it.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Not so much the singing then?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Yeah, we do miss that as well.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
We miss singing, yeah.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
But we like to drink a pot after it.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Finally.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
You need a good drink after a good singing.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
It oils the cords, you know, if you know what I mean.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
It keeps your voice in good nick.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Do you know, are they just going to say next year?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I think as well, removing premises, well I guess, as a worker.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
But I wouldn't gather removing premises to guarantee if we go social distance.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
But not as to not yet saying the answer anyway.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
At the moment.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Are there any other groups that you're part of like separate from each other?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Yeah, I joined, I think it was two years ago, a Nithynata group.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Which is actually when I look at it I'm the youngest.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Which is lovely.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
But we haven't still gone back.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Because we are doing it in the new library.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I think they call it Community Hub.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Or what do they call it now?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And they all, it was nice when you put them in, elderly then.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000
They were all over the, I suppose, eighties, nineties, I think some of them.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So it's all like age limited stuff I think.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And I think about it, with the groups I think we're in.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
So there's not a lot of experience with the other members of using Skype or Teams or?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Sometimes they do Facebook but we don't do Skype or anything.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:35.000
As I said, they know very much I suppose, technically, I think of Skype and more.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And through Facebook.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And Richard, are there any groups that you go on your own to without Helen?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
No, there isn't actually.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
No.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So thinking about the last seven months, how has it affected your wellbeing, your mood and how you feel about things?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Sometimes when you've been on your own quite a bit.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I've got my parents across the road if I need them.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
But sometimes when you just feel down in the dumps sometimes.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Everything we take for granted these days, don't we?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So things, you know, being able to go out whenever you feel like it, see anybody you wish to see.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And I know it's all been taken away.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
It makes you appreciate life in a more way, you know.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And it really is how much you take for granted these days.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Because especially I feel a bit down in the dumps when we get to see friends on Skype.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Because normally, say, on a Saturday, how it means, what we do on a Saturday is actually meeting up with our friend Albie.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
In his house.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And I tend to go and get our friend Kerry.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Because he lives, I think, supposedly down by you, Paul, in the sub-oath.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
So I go down and pick him up.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Come up to as far as Richard, so Richard gets on the bus to go out, don't we?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
So I do miss that bit, just picking him up and having our own chat.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
With Kerry.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
I know it sounds bad to say, well, Richard being there.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:25.000
But he keeps saying to me, I'm like his sister, and he's like my brother, and we miss all that connection.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Really, it makes me, I don't know, appreciate things now.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
If I didn't do it before, I'd just be on.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Because I should have missed the things.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
We're supposed to take for granted, really.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Yeah.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000
So when things return to as normal as they can be, do you think you'll have changed?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
You have changed your life.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Yeah.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Is there anything you're looking forward to that you haven't been able to do since March that you can't wait to do again?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Yes.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
We've got a few shows planned hopefully next year, if they will go ahead.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Which one are you looking forward to the most?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
That's a tricky question.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Two I'm really looking forward to, of all.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Sleen Dioan yn April.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Yeah.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And lucky enough, in June I think, isn't it?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Yes.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
That I bought tickets for me and Richard to go see The Queen with Adam Lambert.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
And where will that be?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Both of them in Birmingham.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Hopefully everything will look okay between.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Yeah, let's hope so.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Otherwise here we'll have to move it around again I suppose.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And we've got, hmm?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Sorry, go on.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000
And we've got a rolling keeping in January if that goes ahead, but I'm not sure that will definitely go ahead yet.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
You're going to Birmingham, how will you get there?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Train.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
You'll just go together, is it?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Yeah.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
And then will you come back the same day or will you stay overnight?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
We'll stay overnight.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Stay overnight.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Stay overnight.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
For both of them.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
You've done that before, has it?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Yeah.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Yeah, we've done that before, yeah.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:39.000
We've done, well this year actually, before actual lockdown, a week before we went up to Craffs, didn't we, right?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Yeah, we did.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
With my mother actually.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Yeah, sorry to interrupt that.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
We were just lucky I suppose to get back in time for lockdown to go in.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And just before lockdown as well, we went to see a megaball in Afibau in Cardiff.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Oh yeah.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Yeah, and that was really good too.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Were you aware of what was going on when you went to see him then?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Yes.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:17.000
We were aware that the coronavirus was around and there was hand sanitizer everywhere during the Craffs, so you could always keep your hands clean and all that.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Yeah.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000
You mentioned going to Birmingham with your parents.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Have your parents both supported you to keep in touch with each other and, you know, have you just seen all the struggling and things like that?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Yeah, because the first thing most people say is, how's it going?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
How's me?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
It's always been, how's Richard? Is Richard coping?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:58.000
So I don't know whether if he wasn't coping or what they would do about it, but it was, how is he coping? Is he doing well?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Yes, yes, okay, mam, yeah, he's doing fine.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Yeah, and there was always, and her parents.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
And friends.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And friends, yeah.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Because when we started working, I would go out for me and my mother and if I see someone they say, well, how's Richard?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.000
And I feel like they were worried about me then, because there was nothing to do with me, it was always Richard.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Richard, when you bubbled, did you ever go to Helen's house?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
No, I didn't actually. Helen always came to me.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Why did you do that, do you think?

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
It was because you're at your own place, I suppose.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Yeah.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:24:00.000
If it wasn't for a reason, I would have come over, because you always, you saw, I'll come over and I think, don't worry, I'll go on my own, home on my own.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
But I always went to Richard's and I.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Yeah.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
I suppose at Richard's, you know, obviously you've got some privacy there, you're not, there's no one else.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Yeah.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Thinking about, like, the restrictions that have been in place, obviously for a while now, have you both, do you remember the first time you went to a shop after lockdown?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
I was at a shop after lockdown.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
I was at a shop after lockdown, so I wear a mask.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Yeah.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Yeah, how did you find being in that environment now with all those new rules?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
I didn't mind it as long as other people did it.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Yeah, because sometimes when you go to tests, of course, people are getting quite close to you when you're going through the aisles and they felt quite, you know, weird and it made you feel a bit apprehensive.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Yeah.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
So.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Have you both, have you gone to, like, restaurants or pubs with the new rules and shops or have you just.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000
We've been to a few restaurants, like Pepper's in Aberdeen.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Yeah, we did go there a couple of times, didn't we?

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Yeah, twice.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
But they always did a track and trace, which I felt was safe.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Yeah, hand sanitiser when you go in.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Yeah.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Yeah.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
They made sure, you know, as you hand sanitiser, use it, take it to the table.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Yeah.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
How did you feel before you went? Was it, like, were you nervous or were you okay about it?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
I was okay about it.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
I was a bit apprehensive, but I had to go on a bus and all that.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
It was the first time in a long time I'd been on a bus, so I was a bit nervous.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:11.000
But I was a water mask, and I started getting better and then the cases started going up again, so.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Are you both concerned about catching the virus?

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I don't.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
I suppose, yes.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Yeah, yes.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
And so, you mentioned face masks, and obviously you have to wear one going fast.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
How do you feel about face masks now and to wear them?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000
I don't like them, but they do when they drop, so you've got to.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
I don't mind wearing it, but the only problem is it steams my glasses up and I can't see through them.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Because, you know, on a Saturday with my father now, I go to church and we've got to wear them for a whole mass.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
So that doesn't work.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.000
First time we did it, oh, I did it, I was driving me nuts, and I couldn't wait to get out to take it off.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000
But what I do on my own is my sister who uses it for a whole time she's in work.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:28.000
She's been eight hours wearing masks, so I don't mind that because it only takes half an hour wearing them as it drives me nuts.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
And how do you feel seeing other people wearing a mask?

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Because, you know, suppose some people may find it difficult to communicate with other people or read that person's facial expressions.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
How do you feel talking to someone wearing a mask?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
It's not too bad.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
I don't mind.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:57.000
I suppose this is the new normal from now on, so we have to get used to it.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.000
We can normally understand them pretty well, so it's not too bad.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
So obviously the Welsh Government have just announced that we're going to have another two-week fire break.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
How did you feel when that was announced?

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Well, we sort of knew it was coming.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I wasn't shocked.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
I wasn't surprised.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:30.000
I didn't feel you would go again, but I suppose it could be a lot worse in England, who's not doing very much really.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
They've done a way to do a lot better than England, that's for sure.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Yeah.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
So do you think you're going to see each other in person again before Christmas?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Yes, I suppose. Yeah.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Yes, yes.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Hold on to hope anyway, hold on, go for it.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Yeah.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
What would you have done for Christmas if there were all these restrictions?

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:08.000
I suppose my house, normally on Christmas time we are grandparents down, and I don't think we are none down now.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
And Richard, you would be there as well?

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
On Christmas day, no, because I'd be with my own family on Christmas day.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Normally before Christmas day and normally after Christmas day we'd see each other then, because normally we have my Gran down for Christmas, but unfortunately she lives in Exeter, so it doesn't matter if she's coming down this year.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
No.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Well, at the moment.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
You've been engaged for about a year, you said earlier?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Yeah.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Yes.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Has all of this changed any plans you may have to get married?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
No.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
No. We haven't really planned anything really.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
No.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
We talked.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Yes.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
But it was nothing, not anything set in stone.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
No.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Is that something you're going to be thinking about in the future, do you think?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Yes.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Yes.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Wait until the rules have changed so people can go to it, is it?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Yeah.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000
I suppose a lot more people can, I don't want it to be a small wedding, really.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
No.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
It doesn't mean to wait a long time, you'll have to wait a long time.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:35.000
So do you think, having spent months apart from each other and then being able to see each other again, do you think moving to cards now?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Hopefully once.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:50.000
In the future, yes, but at the moment with Richard being in Jobcentre, if I move in now, I think it will upset everything of his benefits,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Yeah, it would affect the benefits.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:04.000
I am actively looking for work as best I can, but I'm his employee as well, so hopefully I'll get something soon when the lockdown eases and all that,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
and then hopefully when I do get eventually into work, we'll talk about that and see what we can do.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
So obviously now we're living under a lot of different rules at the moment.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Have you always understood them?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Some of them, yes, but…

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Some of them we've understood, yeah, some of them we find a bit confusing and all that, but mostly we've understood them.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
What rules have you found confusing?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
What rules have you found confusing?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Sometimes a bubbling part of it, like the one now that they said you can go one to one.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
People who live on the rock and roll.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Yes, so yes, Richard, Helen, you are allowed to go and visit Richard still?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Yeah, until Friday I think, but I still say after, but because Richard is doing himself well,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:13.000
even his father, that's for the bit, my mother was saying, no you can't do it.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Richard was saying to me, yes I can do it, so I was in between.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Oh yes, it was a bit confusing.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
I have to go with my mother was saying, because I'm living with her.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
I said, but your father not seeing his father.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And I kept saying, no, you see your father.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Yes, I'll be decided on that.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:44.000
I understand now, of course, Richard you mentioned you're going to be seeing your parents.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:56.000
I understand that you can meet, if you live on your own Richard, you can form a bubble with one of the households.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Obviously you've chosen to be a parent, right?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Yes.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Okay, so that makes sense then.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Yes, because I told him too, because after the year I've had my father, I said, you only got one father?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Yes.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Especially when I only lost nine, I feel it's better to keep this.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
You never know what's around the corner, do you sir?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
No.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Because as I said, I only lost my father, 20 yard, and he had sepsis as well, a year or over a year ago.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
So I only lost him due to that.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000
So I said, seeing your father is more important than seeing me.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Do you think other people are following the rules?

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Some that, yes, but I think mostly youngsters as well.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:02.000
As I say, I've seen Richard, I walk home and the amount of youngsters are out.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
As if it was no Covid.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.000
And there's people out there trying their best to follow the rules, and there's people breaking them on purpose, and it makes you quite angry.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000
People aren't following the rules and all that, and people are trying to follow them as best they can.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000
I think that might be it.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Is there anything else that you think we should mention or talk about, or is there something that maybe you thought you were going to say but I interrupted you or something?

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
No.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
No.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
No?

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Well, thank you very much. I'm now going to stop the recording.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Thank you very much indeed, Paul.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Thank you.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Thank you.
