00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.700
And the night of yourсти,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.700
To the river's power,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.700
The flow'n o'er its waters run out,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.700
With all the will of the wild wild geese,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.700
The river's waves may never feed,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:53.700
With all the will of the wild wild geese,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:02.700
The river's waves may never feed,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:10.700
The river's waves may never feed,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.700
And where the air is bright and wide,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.700
If there is still now, will sublime,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.700
Where the waters still now feed,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.700
Where the water still now feed,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:50.700
Where the water still now feed.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.700
With all its might,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.700
On earth and then in the sky,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.700
The water still now feeds,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.700
The open carry and ease the waves around,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.700
Where the earth and the water feed,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.700
Why is it that all is well then,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.700
If the new and dead are gone,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.700
And all is well then,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:06.700
For your eyes, the eyes of love is now and long,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:17.700
For your eyes, the eyes of love is now and long,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.700
For your eyes, the eyes of love is now and long,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.700
The open carry and ease the waves around,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.700
Where the water still now feeds,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.700
The open carry and ease the waves around,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.700
Where the new and dead are gone,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:05.700
And every passing for your giant is gone.
