00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The Queen Street you wouldn't recognise from 30, 40 years ago.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You wouldn't think it was the same street.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
There were cinemas.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Even Woolworths have gone, you know.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The cinemas have gone.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
How many cinemas were there?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There were the cinemas, there was the Capitol, there was the Queens.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That was the next block to the Capitol.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
On the other side of the road, you just went off the road of a park place, there was the Park Hall.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Then you came back to Queen Street, you had the Olympia.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And next to about one or something to the Olympia you had the Odeon.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But the Odeon was a new name. I forget what it was called.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I dare just come back to me. It was the Imperial.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Then it became the Odeon, part of a chain.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Then you had the Park Hall, I mentioned that I think.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Then at the top of St Mary Street you had the Pavilion.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Half way up on the Hayes, by the fish market there, there was another cinema.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I think it was called the Imperial.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That was what you didn't go to, you know.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That was it. There was the local ones, like the Gaiety in City Road, the Penny Lamb on the corner of Wellfield Road.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It was called the Penny Lamb, was it? Because I knew it was the Globe.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Yes, it was called the Penny Lamb before the Globe.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And then there was the Gaiety.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Then there was the Plaza in North Road, that's gone. Everything's gone.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I think Cardiff suffered, either suffered or benefited from terrific changes.
