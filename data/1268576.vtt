00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Because you're mine, the brightest star I see, the longest star I love and then meet me.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Because you're mine, because you're mine, because you're mine,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the breeze I'm used to I become the melody. And why? Because you're mine, because you're mine.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I only know for as long as I live, I'll only wait for the kiss that you alone may give me.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And when we kiss, that isn't unbelievable, it's only my heart you hear, and it's the bruised, the hurt you're mine.
