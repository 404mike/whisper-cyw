WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
So Winston, hello. Hello, how are you? Very well. So tell me let's kick off.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.920
Tell me your name and where are we? My name is Winston John. I'm here at Larns the moment.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.680
Okay and what brings you to Larn? I'm a lady, there's from Larns 65 years ago.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.600
65 years ago. Wow, that's good. And I'm the way now.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.920
I'm sorry about that. Tell me, you told me that you used to drive a milk churn

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:43.920
lorry. When was that? 1957-58 up to about 61 or 60's. I've got about three years.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.880
About three years. Was it a good job? Yeah, it wasn't bad. I was a young

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.840
just ever driver. I passed my chest when I was 17. Right. And the boss of

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.040
in Canton, he came out and he stripped the lorry down of all the unnecessary stuff

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.720
that was on it. Yeah. I went to weigh it so that I was able to drive it at that age.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.480
I see, sir. He made it as light as possible. Yeah.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.200
And yeah, that's how it started. My father was a milk churn lorry driver all his life.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.280
Really? He worked for Thomas Brothers in Stappern. Right. And they were bought out by

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.160
Winkhamton. Yeah. And he moved to them and that's where he was all his life.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.360
Okay. Okay. And so you were there for three years? Yeah, about three years. Yeah, I think.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.440
I can't quite remember. No, exactly. Yeah. And why did you leave?

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.840
One of the things, a different job. Yeah. What did you go into?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.880
I worked in the factory at one day. Right. After that. Yeah. And what was the factory doing?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.960
Sorry. What was the factory doing? With a metal. All sorts of things. Race, but all.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.240
You know, everything in the gut. A better and right mostly. And what, I'll follow then.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.400
What was the name of the race? All sorts of deliver it for a devon cream.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.600
Yeah. In different things. Okay. Different companies. Yeah. Yeah. And that was all done in John

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.640
Stun in Cmd. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What were you doing in the factory? Oh, lots. I was made.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:34.960
There are big boilers there that used to cook the rice really. And used to go in on the big

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.840
trays with a dozen of them and they just circle around in the boiler for a certain amount of time.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.880
And then go up the other end and then you'd more and more in. Well, it just changed.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.880
I would use to be here. And when you were driving the lobby,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.600
did you do the same round every day? More or less. Yeah. What was that round?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:11.280
Oh, Lord. The place to go. To lay away and everything. I remember there was one particular

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.200
place. I used to enjoy going there. As you enter to lay, you down the hill as a farm,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.880
right on edge of the village, it only left on the side. And I used to pull up there every morning.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.640
And there was a whitehead fox area on Stun. So I used to get out of the lobby.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.360
I used to come round and jump in. The round entail then went around to lay.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.680
I'm back out there both 100 yards under same road where the farm was.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.600
The teddy would come round and we'd sit in the passenger seat.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.160
And I'd stopped there and before he hit in the main road.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.040
I'd open the door and let him out. That was every day. What was his name?

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.760
Oh, I'm not sure. I never saw the farm. I don't know if you can remember.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.360
But the dog was your friend. Yeah. Every day.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.480
Oh, lovely. So when you went out on your rounds, how many rounds a day would you do?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.040
Sometimes three. Depends on some drivers never turned up or something. Yeah. A couple of us

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.720
were going to cover the... But normally? Two, two normally.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.800
Yeah. So what time would you start?

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.320
Half a certain. Half a certain. And finish? Typically?

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.760
Oh, three, half a three. Okay. Okay.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.920
And how many turns on the laundry?

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.120
Oh, I don't know.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.880
I haven't got up yet. I haven't got up yet. I haven't got up yet.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.320
But what kind of laundry well said that? A bed-fund laundry. Yeah.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.800
And sometimes you had a rack on top. So you could put extra turns on and down.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.840
Okay. Yeah.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.080
Was it a hard job?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.760
Heavy. It's not all the stung. The same height as the laundry. You know, you're either at a lift

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.840
them on or drop them or something. So you're just a couple of sleepers.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.360
Yeah. You know. So that was harder then?

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.960
Yeah. Yeah.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.760
A lot of them too, but really? Once you got used to it.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.360
And did you get to know the farmers? A couple of them. Yeah. One thing I got to my credit,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.760
I think, I never left the farmer behind.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.480
Okay. Well done. A lot of drivers. If the children weren't there,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.600
they don't. Gone in the farm, out of trips, in the middle of kids, some of them in those days.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.400
They didn't have the transport like they got now. Yeah.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.160
So if I'd wait about 10 minutes and if you hadn't come down there,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.680
now you're too, if I was able to go up to the farm. Yeah.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.480
And if they were really late, what would the humps go? You know, some breakfast when we finish off?

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.640
Wow, that's nice. Yeah.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:17.520
And I can say, I remember my father coming home with chicken, and bread,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.200
and vegetables, you know, and I never thought much about it.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.920
But then I was having that then because I was waiting for the farmer and the following day,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.480
or a couple of days later, they'd be a chicken on the stand,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.240
or the box of vegetables, or the bag of potatoes. Yeah.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.360
Thank him, he for waiting, you know. That happened quite a lot.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.520
The same, and it was the same farmer, or often or not.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.920
There was always legs. Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.440
So what I'm hearing then is that they appreciated your,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.120
Oh yeah. Your health. Yeah.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.880
And you were really part of that community. I never left anyone behind.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.560
Yeah. I'm sure a lot of people were very grateful for that.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.080
Yeah, well, in those days, it didn't have the transport that they got today.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.480
You know, to take the milk to the factory. Yeah.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.280
And what happened in the summer when it was hot with the milk?

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.400
Oh, the, it was oily in the morning, it didn't really affect it.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.720
Okay.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.880
Sometimes there was the drip wet sacks over it, it says.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.880
Yeah. But that was very sad.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.920
I wonder if I wouldn't have got very cold in the winter.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.720
Oh, it was cold. I'm in the gym.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.680
You never fought much of a load of it, didn't you?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.960
You just, you just did it. Just got on with it.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.040
You were young. Yeah. Yeah.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.720
And you would left before the winter of 63, then, did you?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.120
Yeah. Oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.040
So you didn't have to struggle through the snow. No.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.160
No. Yeah. Yeah.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160
That was, uh, you were lucky there.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.120
Um, so what were the best bits of the job?

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.160
Painting.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.760
Was it a well-paid job?

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.960
No, it was obviously. I think I don't think it was,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.600
you went over paid, just a few of it, then.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.760
But it, uh, you know, you had your time, you had to

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.160
maybe to go to the camp, then, uh,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.240
obviously, no, and things like that.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.000
It was all right.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.440
And how many days a week did you work?

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.720
Well, some days, seven.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.240
Worked for a small stay.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.120
Of course. Yeah.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.960
After six days a week, normally.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.800
But I've been there.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.880
And you, you know, it's sort of like, you couldn't say like,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.280
you're having a read Wednesday, office, and then, you could, like,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.920
a Tuesday this week, Wednesday next week.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.160
Okay.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.920
You know, to cope with all of it,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.680
somebody else to do your own, you know.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.320
What would be other drivers like?

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.480
Sorry. What would the other drivers like?

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.280
Oh, they were good.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:00.800
Yeah.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.720
Oh, pretty good.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.560
You come good friends?

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.200
Hey.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.160
Were they good friends?

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.960
Oh, yeah.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.000
Yeah.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.520
And how many people were working there?

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.200
Oh, what happened?

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:11.440
We

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.440
25, 30 hours going out every day.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:15.680
Wow.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.040
And then in the factory?

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.840
It's all possible.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.840
100 or more.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.080
You're all doing different kinds of work, you know.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.160
What we got back to the factory with the children,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.480
you put them in and put them on in so that they weigh each farm.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.040
You know, that was a, and then you load up the empties again and then off again.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.640
And how did they know which milk came from which farm?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.760
Yeah, that sort of thing.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.400
They were, they were the label on them.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.520
And you take the label off,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.080
the four terms or whatever.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.880
Yeah.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.320
And they'd be way that.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.840
But it was continued, it wasn't, it wasn't,

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.040
we didn't stop, you know.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.160
We just kept waiting for each farm out and the guy you're never

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.320
weighed in, next one, next one.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.120
And somebody else was writing a book then,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.920
with that.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.640
No, I don't know.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.120
Right, no.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.800
Well, that would be all right.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.200
I think he might have other book in front of him.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.320
Yeah.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.960
And, and were you in the union?

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.040
Yes.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.560
Yeah.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.520
What union was it?

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.480
Can you remember?

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:28.880
Sorry.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.000
What union was it?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.640
Can you remember?

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.320
I haven't got a clue.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.800
But you remember the union.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.000
Yeah, I think we have to be that, that, yeah.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.800
Ever gone strike?

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.000
No.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:40.720
No.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.200
No.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.800
So it was Coingate who were your employers?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.440
Coingate.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.320
No, Wing Company.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.120
Wing Company.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.760
Yeah.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.040
And what was Coingate then?

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.760
Well, there were a lot of us, the milk factory.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.240
Right.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.960
Okay.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.280
Okay.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.520
And Wing Company contracted out to collect the milk for them.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.560
I understand.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.040
Okay.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.240
I wasn't aware of that.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.960
No.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.160
I get that, man.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.120
Do you remember your salary?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.880
Not a clue.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.360
Not a clue.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.280
I know it wasn't enough.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.640
It was a long time ago.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.120
So what?

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.480
Over 60 years ago.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.040
Yeah.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.240
Yeah.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.560
I mean, I'm 84, now this year.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.120
Wow.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.240
Well, that would be looking great.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.560
Obviously, that stood you in good stead.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.080
So, do you, you know,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.360
do you have any favorite stories about those times?

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.120
I do not know.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.600
Farmer used to go to under.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.120
You had to pull just off the road.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.480
The stun was in his lane.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.360
So he just pulled in there and re-bossed back out.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.920
And there was a bloody bull used to come and meet me every moment.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.400
Wherever in the field he was, wherever in the eye pulled up.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.200
Yeah.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.560
And there's all the words, there's a wide offense the other side of the road,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.200
of the lane.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.880
I could come thunder and out,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.440
and get into a stop beyond barely rain and dig in.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:03.840
Yeah.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.480
Oh, it's like a great funerary.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.920
Teasing and there and there.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.960
And I was frightened and the beginning was thinking he'd come through the fence.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.760
Yeah.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.400
He never did.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.720
We got to escape to say hello, right?

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.840
So you got the dog come into you.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.400
Yeah.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.760
You got the bull come into you.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.000
Yeah.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.720
So you had quite a family of animals.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.320
So you were welcome to be here with me when we were born in.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.880
I've always been a little animal, right?

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.040
So they loved you back.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.240
I don't know what the bull would have done, right?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.360
And what was the worst thing that happened?

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.400
I don't know.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.160
I can't remember anything, really bad.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.440
No accidents.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.400
No, I'm not talking.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:46.880
Yeah.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.200
My father had a lot of metal for safe driving,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.600
and he had a lot of accident going.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.240
He was there.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.960
And he was there virtually.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.200
Well, he must have been 30 or 30 years old.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:12:59.680
Oh.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.160
Yeah.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.400
Plus what he was doing before.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.360
Yeah.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.920
I'm probably the other job because of him.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.720
Yes.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.520
Well, maybe.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:09.920
Yeah.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.440
Or probably because you were a good driver too.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.560
No, I don't.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.240
We just passed my test in the car.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.560
So what was your like at night on your first day?

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.400
Oh, that's all right.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.640
Yeah.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.640
We had another driver come with you just to show you that.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.440
Yeah.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.120
Yeah, it's fine.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.080
Do you remember some of the farm names?

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.080
No, I don't.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.560
Yeah.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.280
I never slept at bother much with names of the farms.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.720
You got new weather, were?

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.440
Yeah.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.320
We do your roots.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:42.960
Yeah.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.840
And so.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.960
So how many farms would you collect from there on a day, do you think?

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.600
Well, it was.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.440
34 people have.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.160
Wow.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:52.800
OK.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.280
Yeah.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.680
But always in that trillich.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.680
My dream trillich.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.480
Oh, yeah.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.280
And...

00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.840
Talog.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.600
Sorry.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.560
Talog.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.840
Yeah, old runder.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:04.800
Yeah.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.600
I feel...

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.600
Because there's still lots of daily farms there now.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.000
Yeah.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.840
You know, after 60 years, there's still some of them.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.480
Still going?

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.200
Yeah.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.040
Imagine trillich.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.440
All the way up.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.200
And then you should pass the...

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.520
I don't know, I got the plug on already.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.360
Yeah.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.720
In bulk new ways.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.360
Yeah.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:29.840
Yeah.
