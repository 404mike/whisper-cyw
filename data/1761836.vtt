WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640
Hello Steve, how are you? Do you want more time because I've got all I'm in no hurry.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:18.280
No, no it's fine. The university just called an all-starved meeting about some finance

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.560
stuff which I didn't have in my diary when we organised this but to be honest I only

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.800
have a bowl of soup for lunch. That's all sorted out.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.360
Do you know that the link you sent me? Oh yes, yeah. I don't know if that was written for an

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.760
academic audience but I found it really accessible. I mean that was the first book that I ever wrote.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:49.840
Oh really? I've never written in a jargon written way. I think it is a fair criticism of my work

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.480
that it's not the most theoretically incisive research. I don't do that kind of stuff.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.720
I think that because pretty much all the work that I do is related to the landscape

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.480
that is kind of all around us so I think it's easy to write in a way and about things that

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:19.520
people can relate to rather than stuff that's buried in the ground or shards of pottery that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.040
we dig up and get terribly excited by and so on. That is actually all a bit more abstract.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.840
Yes, because it doesn't look like a pot does it?

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.340
Absolutely.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.560
Whereas if you're talking about the names of settlements or why fields of a particular

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.760
shape, anyone who lives in the countryside can think oh god yeah I can understand that now.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.200
So I think I do work that is easier to communicate to people than lots of my colleagues who might

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.600
do more scientific research.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.160
Yeah, yeah. Where did you get them all from? Sorry I'm going off on the tangent now.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.680
This is the book titled The Gwent Levels.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.840
Yes, let me just check. The one you sent me.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.200
Is now freely available online.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.680
I'm just yeah the um sorry Steve you've lost my faith but it is yeah The Gwent Levels,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.400
the evolution of a wetland landscape.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.800
Well that the history of that book I mean you I mean you will have heard talk of a gentleman

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.920
called Rick Turner.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.880
Yes, yes.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.040
Sadly died um um well Rick was he used to work for Caddo.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.540
Yeah.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.160
And he in the early 1990s he recognized that the Gwent Levels were threatened with development

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.760
and in particular the proposed diversion of the M4 south of people.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.400
Yeah.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.600
Now I back then I was a research student at Reading and I was doing my thesis on the reclamation

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.000
of the wetlands all around the southern estuary.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.760
Why were you doing that? Why did you choose that?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:07.920
Um the reason well looking back it's slightly odd that my undergraduate dissertation supervisor

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.720
was working with another colleague up in Gloucestershire.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.200
Yeah.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.440
Of the history of the reclamation so sort of the areas that Rose is more familiar with.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.940
Okay.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.560
He just thought it would be interesting to have somebody look at Somerset and um

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.160
The Gwent Levels.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.960
Okay.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.840
I wanted to do a PhD and so he sort of gently encouraged me to do that.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.340
Yeah.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.360
Um I started giving odd papers at conferences that Rick went to so he heard about my work.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:46.480
Um in a way what I was doing was exactly what he wanted anyway um and I still remember we were

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.880
at a conference at you know St Fagans.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.400
Yes yeah yeah.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.720
And um after after we had a conference and then we would some of us were just wandering

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.080
around the outdoorsy bits and Rick sidled up to me.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.120
Can I have a chat sort of thing.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.520
What are you planning on doing after your PhD?

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.040
Um because he wanted a commission.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.360
Yeah.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.520
The Gwent Levels Historic Landscape Study.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.920
Now of course for me I mean this was like somebody was offering me two years work.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:24.880
And Rick jointly funded that with what was then called the Countryside Council for Wales.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.200
Okay.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.800
CCW.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.360
Yeah.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.120
That is now it's morphed into Natural Resources Wales.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.920
Okay yeah.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.520
So they they they funded it 50 50.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.800
Yeah yeah.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.880
But it was only part way through the project that I realised that it was partly funded because of

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.800
this threat of the M4 proposed M4 diversion.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.600
Yeah yeah.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.440
Um and I haven't I haven't got this in writing.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.600
I'd love to have this in writing but one of the early highlights of my career was I gave a paper

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.600
on my work to a group at the Welsh Office Highways.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.640
Yes.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.960
And um once again this bloke came up to me afterwards and sort of said oh Dr Rippon very

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.080
nice to meet you you know very interested in your work.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.520
Do you realise that you've moved a motorway?

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.800
And he went on to explain that the work that I did was instrumental in shifting the original

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.200
proposed line of the motorway was to go right through the middle of Whitsun Goldcliff Nash.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.760
Really?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.320
Yeah.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.880
Right.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.960
Yeah.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.080
So a very a route that went quite close to the coast.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.320
Yeah.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.880
And it was because I managed to sort of make the case for the the importance of this landscape.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.040
Yeah.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.680
That they moved it to the northern route.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.480
Wow.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.760
Essentially along the southern side of the old steelworks.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.360
How phenomenal.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.000
So I know that I of course now the motorway is not going to be built anyway but um I haven't

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.920
got it in writing but it's there.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.400
That doesn't matter.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.880
It further confirms it as well.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.720
What was Rick Turner like then?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.280
Steve sorry I'm recording this is that okay because I'm going to transcribe it and I'll

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.560
send it to you afterwards but what was um Rick Turner like?

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.240
I mean he I mean he was lovely he um he was one of these people that's was quite quiet

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.280
doesn't necessarily doesn't sprout off and so on um no ego or anything like that just quietly

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.840
gets on with things and he was an absolute pleasure to work with um I mean he had a long

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.960
standing interest in wetlands.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.460
Why?

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.840
He used to be the archaeologist at Cheshire County Council I think it was but he was an

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:57.280
archaeologist in Cheshire when um some gentlemen who were cutting peat found a preserved body

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.480
and it was the body was called Lindow Man.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.040
Oh yes.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.640
And it's the best preserved what's called bog body.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.140
Yeah.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.800
Yeah.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.760
And Rick was the first archaeologist kind of like on call who went out to see it.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.260
Yeah.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.240
And he sort of oversaw that project.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.800
Then he got a job as an inspector of ancient monuments at Caddo.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.600
Yeah.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.840
But because of his particular interest in wetlands he was kind of given the seven estuary

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.000
as part of his job description as sort of like Caddo's man on the levels as it were.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.500
Yeah.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.320
So yeah I mean he was sort of knowledgeable about wetlands he absolutely saw the value of them.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.820
Yeah.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.600
And I think sort of without making it obvious I think he must have known that it was the first

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.960
time I'd had a proper job.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:57.120
And I know I didn't really I think when you're that young you possibly

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.880
don't get worried about stuff as perhaps you do a little bit as you get older.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.160
That's true.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.660
Yeah.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:09.120
But he certainly helped guide me through some of the things or for some of the meetings needing

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.240
to produce certain sorts of documents and so on and so forth.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.320
He gently guided and sort of supported me and so.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:16.820
Yeah.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.280
What remit did he give you then?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.880
Sorry?

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.240
What remit did he give you?

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.840
It was agreed that I had to produce two reports.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.340
Yeah.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:39.200
One was going to be the published book which you've read and the other one which I know

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:47.040
has been used a lot within planning departments and so on and so forth.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.600
It was never formally published.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.520
It had a very limited print run.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.020
Okay.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:59.520
And that gave like a little description of each character area on the levels.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.920
If you think sort of the area around Nash and Goldcliff,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.720
if you look at a map there's little settlements dotted about.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:08.960
Yeah.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.360
The fields quite small and fiddly.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.240
I mean that's quite an old sort of medieval landscape.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.320
That's one character area.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:16.820
Okay.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.020
And then you've got, if you go further inland,

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:27.220
sort of south of the Hanwen still works, you've got areas of long straight roads.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:27.720
Yes.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.460
Very rectilinear fields.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:29.700
Yeah.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.180
There's all no settlements actually.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.340
And it's the latest area to have been drained and reclaimed.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.820
It was farmed by farmers who lived elsewhere

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.740
because those parts of the levels would have been too wet to live in.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.420
So that's a different character area.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.920
Yeah.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.420
Yeah.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.900
What this second report did was divide the levels up into sort of these character areas

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.500
and write about them in turn.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.380
So it's very much a companion volume to the one that you've read.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.980
You've read the one that gives the big chronological, if you like, narrative.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:09.480
Yeah.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.760
The other really provided a lot of the detail about each area.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.480
Yeah.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.920
And is that available anywhere?

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.160
I don't think it is.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.660
Really?

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.520
No. I mean there were hundreds of copies printed.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.020
Yeah.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.800
But I know, I think they were all sort of snapped up really quite quickly.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.600
I think I've got two copies left, one at home and one in the office at work.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.100
Yeah.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:43.340
It's the sort of thing now that would look terribly dated because of course it was done

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:50.140
on my little Mac computer rather than proper desktop publishing and so forth.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.020
Nowadays, of course, something like that would at least be made freely available as a PDF.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.520
Yeah.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:02.460
But when the project started in 1993, there was no email.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.020
So hard to think of.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.260
I don't know if I had a mobile.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.460
I don't think I did back then.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.660
So it was a very, very different world.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.740
That was my remit was to produce those two reports.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:28.220
But I say I know through talking to Rick that by the end of the project, I was aware

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:35.740
that actually the big remit was to produce a report that would try and move this road

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.220
and stop this road from going right through the middle of the levels.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.140
Off the record, you did.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.860
Which I did until they decided not to build it at all.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.120
Yes.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.940
Steve, I've got some questions but I might,

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.740
but I wonder if you could just start.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.740
This might seem a bit basic to me.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:05.660
If you can just introduce yourself and your specialism and

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.060
your involvement with the grant levels and with the levels project.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.300
The living levels project.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.500
Living levels project, yeah.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:20.780
Well, as I say, I am a professor of landscape archaeology at the University of Exeter.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.620
And my interest in the wetlands around the Severn Estuary goes back to my PhD.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:34.700
That was a study of both sides of the estuary and it looked at the changing ways that human

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:40.300
communities exploited the rich natural resources of these wetlands.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:47.020
And then gradually started to intensify how they used the wetlands.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.780
Rather than just hunting and fishing, they started grazing their livestock,

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.180
in banking the land, using it for arable farming and so on.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.820
And I looked at that over the Roman and the medieval periods.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:09.180
Then I got the job doing the grant levels historic landscape study that we talked about.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.180
That was from 1993 to 1995.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:23.500
Then I got a government funded fellowship to do a comparison of wetland use all the way around

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.700
Britain and North West Europe.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.460
And then I got the lectureship at the University of Exeter.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.020
Oh wow.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.580
Ever since.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:32.700
Okay.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:40.860
And I think, I mean, what I try to do in my work is to sort of cross boundaries.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:51.580
So I love using archaeological evidence, maps, written documents that I can access.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.660
I can't read medieval Latin or anything.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.900
But I can read sort of 17th century handwriting onwards and so on.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.900
So I love looking at some of the old documents interpreting place names and so on.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:04.860
Yeah.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.100
So I try to be very interdisciplinary.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:07.340
Yeah.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:08.860
Is that unusual?

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.300
Sorry?

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.180
Is that unusual?

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:21.020
It's not unusual for a relatively small group that would call themselves landscape archaeologists.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:21.520
Yeah.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.420
It is to my eternal frustration, and don't write this down,

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:34.140
but too many archaeologists and too many historians, for example, will only study one thing.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:34.860
Yeah.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.180
Yeah.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.180
No, they will do is study place names.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:39.680
Yeah.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.540
Or all they will study is pottery.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.040
Yeah.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:53.820
Or they're only really interested in burial sites, not the wider landscape.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.140
All they do is study burials and so on.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.980
And then you miss context then, don't you?

00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:59.660
You lose context.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.160
Yeah.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:00.720
Yeah.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:08.220
What's often said about landscape archaeology is that you're a jack of all trades and a master of none.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.180
And that is true.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:17.340
There are people out there that know a darn sight more about place names than I do.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:17.840
Yeah.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.740
But I know a darn sight more about landscapes than place names experts do.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.020
So to the uninitiated, what is a landscape historian?

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.100
Well, I mean, you can use it in two senses.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.140
Well, landscape archaeologists, sorry.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:35.660
All right, yeah.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:41.980
I mean, in a sense, I would say a landscape archaeologist is a landscape historian.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.380
In the sense of somebody who's trying to write the story of a landscape.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:47.500
Yeah.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.380
But the normal meaning of landscape history is only to study documents.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.440
Okay.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:16:00.140
What distinguishes archaeology is that you study physical remains.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:00.640
Yeah.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.400
So archaeology is studying the past through its material remains.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:06.900
Yeah.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.440
Those would be things that you dig from beneath the ground.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:11.940
Yeah.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.840
Right the way through to what I tend to focus in on, what we would call the historic landscape.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.340
Yeah.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:26.160
Which is the present day patterns of fields and roads and settlements and land uses

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.080
that although they're in use today, can be 100 years old,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.400
a thousand years old, or they can be 2000 years old.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.520
So they're above ground.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.280
Above ground.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:39.780
Yeah.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:48.320
So on the Gwent levels, quite a lot of those rings and the field boundary ditches

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.280
are medieval in date.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.920
So they probably are about 800 years old.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:54.660
Mm-hmm.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:02.880
If you go to the far west of Cornwall, have you ever been on holiday to Pennsance or St Ives?

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.520
I am walking there this summer actually on the coastal path.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.560
Well, well if you do the coastal path around West Penn with.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.060
Yeah.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.440
Okay. Pass Lands End.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:15.940
Yeah.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.040
If you do that stretch.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.540
Yeah.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.200
In places you will be walking through field systems, field boundaries.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:23.700
Yeah.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.800
That are at least 2000 years old.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.920
Why, really?

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.440
So what should one be looking for?

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.840
This is where if we were meeting face to face, I could draw you a sketch.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.340
Yeah.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.840
What we all find is that,

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.280
you've got a hillside that's on a slope.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:47.780
Yeah.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.280
Okay.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.280
The slope isn't smooth.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:53.780
Yes.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.640
It's stepped.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.560
And where it is stepped is where you've got a field boundary.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.060
Yeah.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.740
Okay.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.240
Yeah.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.880
If the field is ploughed.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.380
Yeah.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.200
Over many, many hundreds of years.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:09.700
Yeah.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.040
Soil gets washed down slope.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:13.540
Yeah.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:21.520
Okay. And it builds up behind these field boundaries which are stone, rubble and earth and banks.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.880
Okay. Yeah.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.280
This sort of, so the fields literally they have like a stepped profile.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:29.780
Yeah.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.040
As you go down.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:38.000
And there have been archaeological excavations of these field boundaries, a dating of them.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.800
And they go back around about 2000 years.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.920
That's extraordinary.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.760
It's absolutely extraordinary.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.040
Isn't it? Oh my gosh.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:54.480
I mean those fields in that West Penwith region are pretty unique.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.200
Yeah. How have they survived all this time?

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.840
Almost certainly in continuous use.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.800
Yeah. Yeah.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.280
I mean it's, it is astonishing to think.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:06.580
Wow.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.020
Yeah.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.760
So yeah, it's a very, very special landscape.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:18.320
So do you identify it from ground level or do you need to be using a drone or flying over a landscape?

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.000
Well there's sort of two different approaches.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.040
The specifics of those West Penwith field systems, that really, I mean it's obvious on the ground.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.560
As you look around that landscape.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.840
If you know what you're looking for.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.200
Yeah. Yeah.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.800
You've got these very distinctive sort of stepped profiles down.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.300
Sorry.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:41.600
Yeah.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.160
That means that those fields have been ploughed for hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.280
The soil has gradually got washed down and accumulated behind these banks.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.520
So you really need to be in the field.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.020
Yeah.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.640
Where you've got the Gwent levels.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.120
The work I did there fundamentally is trying to understand the shapes of the fields.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.320
Yeah. Yeah.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.520
And you do that really from just from maps.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.020
Yeah.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.840
But to somebody who's not an archaeologist and you say understand the shapes of fields,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.080
somebody might say, so what?

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.480
You know, what does the shape of field tell you?

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.960
Different morphologies of fields.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.460
Yeah.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.120
Are often created through different processes.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:29.620
Okay.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.360
So for example, different land uses.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:38.840
So if you've got very long, narrow fields.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.340
Yeah.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.760
They're like little strips of land.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.260
Yeah.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:48.520
That is indicative of land that used to be in one enormous field.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.020
Yeah.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.720
It was divided up into strips.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.400
Yeah.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:01.440
As a way of distributing the land equally amongst all members of the community.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.640
Is that strip grazing?

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.840
Is it really called strip grazing or is that something different?

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.700
Yeah. I don't know the phrase strip grazing.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.980
Okay. I've heard it here in Herefordshire. So yeah, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.580
I think that might be something different.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.080
Yeah.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.860
It would either be used as arable land for grazing, for growing crops.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:25.360
Yeah.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.460
Or it could be used as meadow.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.500
Okay. Yeah.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.020
Yeah.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:39.040
And what would happen each year is that all of those strips would be distributed to each

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.040
member of the community.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.540
Okay.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:46.200
So if you're quite a big land owner, you might get five strips.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:46.700
Yeah.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.760
If you were a relatively lowly peasant, you might only get one strip.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.260
Yeah.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:51.760
Yeah.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.660
They're sometimes called dole moors.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:02.660
Moor is simply the old English word for a wet boggy landscape.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.160
Yeah.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:08.860
But dole, we are of the generation that remembers the word dole.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.580
As in D-O-L-E you mean?

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.080
Yeah.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:12.580
Yeah.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.580
As in the unemployment benefit.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.580
Oh my goodness. Yeah.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:25.320
And the reason is, the common root of it is to dole out is to distribute.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.000
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:36.600
So the old almost slang phrase for the dole, being on the dole, comes from this root of

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.400
this word which means and for an organization to distribute something.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.400
Ah, ah, okay.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.920
So that's why they're known as dole moors.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:54.180
They're wet boggy landscapes divided up into strips and they are distributed out to members

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.180
of the community.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:23:03.340
Do you know, you said you arrived in, was it the early 90s to do your, so was it the

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:10.700
case that before then that it was an area that was overlooked as having this rich architectural,

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.700
archaeological potential?

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.700
Was it?

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.680
The, hang on, can I just quickly, hang on.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:29.200
Um, what, there'd been a huge amount of work done on the prehistoric archeology.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200
Yeah.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.200
Of the Severnestri wetlands.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.200
So this is sort of pre-Roman evidence.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200
Yeah.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.200
And a huge amount of work had been done on that.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200
Yeah.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:47.700
What we knew far less of was what was going on in the Roman and the medieval periods.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:55.700
And that's partly why my PhD supervisor started looking at this up in Gloucestershire.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:56.700
Mm-hmm.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:01.700
And then suggested that I looked at it for my PhD.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.700
Yeah.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.700
Um, in Somerset and in, in the, in the Gwent levels.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.700
Okay.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.200
I was quite lucky to be almost in the right place at the right time.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.200
Yeah.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:18.200
Um, it's, it's when there was increasing interest in, in wetlands and a realisation

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.200
how important wetlands were.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.200
Yeah.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:28.200
We knew about the remarkably well-preserved remains in the wetlands.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.200
Mm.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.200
Beneath the surface.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.200
Yeah.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:38.200
And nobody really looked at sort of the history of the modern, the modern, the present-day

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.200
landscape and how old that was.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.200
Okay.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200
Yeah.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.200
And so doing that was the sort of thing that I was interested in.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:52.700
And I was just very fortunate that my PhD supervisor suggested that I looked at a landscape

00:24:52.700 --> 00:25:00.500
that suddenly was going to become politically quite important, as it were, in terms of the

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.000
proposed route of this road.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Yeah.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
So I was in the-

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
But what's the area though?

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
The Cowdercott and the Gwent Luke levels.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
I mean it's huge, isn't it?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Huge area of study.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Um, well that's actually quite small compared to the Somerset levels.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Really?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Okay.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
The Somerset levels are even bigger.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Yeah.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Is that because they're on the Windward side or is that because-

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Is that because they're on the Windward side or we are the-

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
No, it's just the-

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.500
Actually, that is quite different.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:36.500
The Gwent levels, you've got this area of former salt marsh-

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.500
Yeah.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.500
That formed going out from the coast.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:48.000
On the Somerset side of the estuary, what you've actually got are, if you like, a series

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
of former valleys that were flooded by rising sea level.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Yeah.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.000
So, um, have you ever driven down the M5 from Bristol to say as far as Taunton?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Okay.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
You might, now I explain to you, you'll go, ah yes.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.500
Right, you're leaving, you've crossed the River Avon.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.500
Yeah.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:18.000
Okay, and you go along that slightly frightening bit where the M5 is terraced into the coast.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Yes, yes.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Yeah.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Yeah.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Then you go down a slope and you drive across what are known as the North Somerset levels.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Okay, I wasn't aware of that, but yes.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Flat bit.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Yeah.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Huge wetland.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Then you come to the Western Supermare Junction.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Yeah.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
And then you go through another cutting.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Yes.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
It's cut into rock.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Hmm.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
You go out the other side, you then go across another flat bit.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Um, and then you go, when you get to near Bridgewater, you go into another sort of cutting.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Yeah.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.000
And that's because the motorway is cutting through ridges of high ground between the

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
low-lying wetlands.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Okay, okay, yeah.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
So it's very different to the Welsh side where you've just got this one big sort of like

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
coastal marshland.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Hmm.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:17.000
In Somerset, you've got flat wetlands between ridges of high ground.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Yeah.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:28.000
So would you say, so say, um, say the work of Martin Bell, for example, could I say that's

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
micro-archaeology and what yours is doing is macro?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Um, well, um, sort of.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Yes.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
To be honest, I can see exactly where you're coming from.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Martin is an archaeologist who sees the landscape more than some of his prehistoric colleagues,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
should we say.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
But yes, Martin's research focuses on field work in specific places.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
There was, I don't get obsessed with one particular place, I look at the landscape as a whole.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Yeah.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
And you're getting the context of that area and how it all links and works with each other

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
and relates to each other.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Yeah.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Yeah.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
So I suppose, yes, sort of traditional field archaeology, you could say is micro.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Yeah.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
And a more landscape oriented approach is more sort of macro.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Yeah.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Um, I wouldn't say one is better or more important than the other.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
They're different and they're therefore sort of complementary.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Yeah, they feed into each other, I would say.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
You work together.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Yeah.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Um, I've got, I might jump around a bit, Steve.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
How long have you got, by the way?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Um, probably, we're probably around for another half an hour or so.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Yeah, I'll, sorry, I get distracted easily.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Um, so, um, Professor John Allen's name has come up.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Did you know him?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Yes.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Well, do you remember when I said about my PhD supervisor pushing me in this direction?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
He was a chap called Mike Falford.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Yeah.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
So, um, he, and I did mention that there was a, he had a colleague.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Yeah.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
That was John Allen.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Oh, really?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Okay, yeah.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
So those were the two who were working on the Gloucestershire wetlands at the time.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Right, okay.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Um, so, um, John didn't, he wasn't one of my PhD supervisors, but I worked with John

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
on, on various things over the years.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Um, I mean, he was a remarkable man.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Um, once again, quite quiet and modest and so on.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
He'd never stand in meetings spouting off like some people do.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Yeah.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
You know, he was a lovely man, very quiet, but just so knowledgeable across so many fields.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Was he a geologist?

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Yes, he, his background was as a geologist.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Um, he's, he once, he once explained to me how he wanted to spend about 10 years on a

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
particular research topic and then move on.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Yeah.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:29.000
So he did a huge amount of work on, it was a particular geological period, and I can't

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
remember what it was.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
It was, but tens of millions of years ago.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Yeah.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
What some back sort of period.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Wow, yeah.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
And he was like the world's expert on that.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Cool.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
And then he decided, then I think he did something else.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
I can't remember what that was.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
He might have got into some type of fossil.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
I can't remember.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
But then he got interested in salt marshes.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Yeah.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
So instead of something that was tens of millions of years old.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Yeah.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
He was interested in salt marshes that are only a few hundred or a few thousand years

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
old.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Yeah.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
And he started to study the salt marshes around the Severn Estuary as a way of studying sea

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
level change.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Okay, yeah.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Now he, the most amazing eye.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Yeah.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
You'd be out in the field and you'd be talking to him, walking along and he'd go off on a

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
tangent because he'd seen something 20 meters away.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Wow, yeah.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
So he started to find bits of pottery.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Yeah.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Salt marshes that he was studying.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Thought it looked old.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
So of course he took it to the archaeology department at Reading.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Met Mike Falford.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Yeah.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Mike had a quick look at this pottery, said it was Roman.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Yeah.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
And that's how their lifelong collaboration started.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
How amazing.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
So he only died recently, didn't he, I think?

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Yeah.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Yeah.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Yeah.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:15.000
So he was a member of this, is it Severn Estuary levels research committee that you're on?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Yeah.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Back in the early to mid 1980s, so we're going back a long way now, there was a proposal

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
to build a barrage across the Severn Estuary.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Have you heard of that?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Now that would have had huge implications for lots of things, including the archaeology.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Yeah.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.000
So some of the archaeologists who were working in and around the estuary back in the 1980s

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000
got together to establish what they call the Severn Estuary levels research committee.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Okay.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Now the Severn barrage proposal disappeared relatively quickly.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Yeah.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Because it basically would be so phenomenally expensive.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Yeah.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
It didn't get going.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:17.000
But I think it did, it stimulated this sort of group of archaeologists to stay together

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
with this, it's a relatively informal little sort of research group.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Yeah.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.000
And so to say, I became a member of it when I started my PhD in 1989.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Okay.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:40.000
When my recollection is that the threat of the barrage had largely passed, I think.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000
But I mean, John Allen was very, very active back then studying his salt marshes and he'd

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
got interested in sort of medieval reclamation and so on.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Yeah.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Martin had done some work at Breeing Down on the Somerset side of the estuary.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Yeah.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
He, I think, was now getting interested on the Welsh side.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000
There was another remarkable figure in the history of the levels, was a chap called Derek

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Upton.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Yes, yes, I was going to ask you about him.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Yeah.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
He worked at the steelworks and he was a bird watcher.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
And he's somebody else with the most amazing eye.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
He started seeing strange things.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Yeah.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Seeing objects, seeing things in the intertidal area of the estuary.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Yeah.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
I don't know who he first reported his finds to.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
I'm not sure.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Yeah.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
But once again, quite quickly, he got to know various archaeologists and people that he

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
could report his finds to.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Yeah.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
And took him seriously as well, I suppose.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Sorry?

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
And also who took him seriously.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Absolutely.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
I think that was the key thing.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Yeah.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
So he was spotting little woven fish baskets and so on.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Yeah.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
I think he might have discovered some of the first human footprints.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Yes.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Of course, Martin Bell has spent a lot of his time studying human footprints.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Yeah.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
And so on.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
So there was this sort of, it's just very fortuitous.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:28.000
I think a lot of people sort of being around the estuary and then suddenly being drawn

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
in by this particular threat.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Yeah.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Yeah.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000
And then kind of sticking together once that threat had gone, simply because it's a remarkable

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
landscape to research.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
And it's raised its profile, I suppose, as well.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Yeah.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
So does it have any statutory protection?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
It does for its nature conservation interests.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Yeah.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:01.000
I mean, both sides of the estuary are relatively well protected in terms of habitat, ecology

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
related protection.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:10.000
But unfortunately, there's not really anything big and powerful on the statutory front that

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
protects it from solar farms, et cetera.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Yeah.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
So no, my feeling is that our special landscapes don't have enough legal protection.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Yeah.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
And we're seeing this on the grant levels.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
They're not going to be there in a few years' time.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Do you not think so?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Really?

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Well, no.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
I mean, they're building a solar farm at Whitsun.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Are they really?

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
I didn't know that.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Yeah, that's going ahead.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Why?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
There's posals for a huge one on the Wentlewg level.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Yeah, yeah, I've heard that one.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Yeah.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
And there's proposals for another one at Redwick.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:00.000
And although solar farms don't permanently destroy a landscape, like housing development

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
or steelworks, for example, but they'll ruin the appearance.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
No, there's no doubt about it.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Yeah.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:19.000
And on the Gloucestershire side, once again, when you drive along the M4 from South Wales

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
to Bristol, you go over an equivalent wetland on the Bristol side of the estuary.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
And it's just getting covered in massive industrial units.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
I think there's a huge Amazon depot there, for example.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Oh, wow.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Well, I suppose it's happened in Whendlewg already, hasn't it?

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
You know, that has been subject to far more development than the Caldecott side.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Yeah.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:50.000
But for you, I mean, has wetlands become your specialism, would you say?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Well, it was for, once again, probably sort of 10, 15 years or so.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Yeah.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
I mean, I made a conscious decision to move on.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Yes.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Simply because as an academic, it's very easy to almost get typecast, to use an acting analogy.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000
So I absolutely consciously decided, right, I'm now going to start studying other things.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Yeah.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
So I do quite a lot of work now.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Well, I had a period in my life, a bit like John Allen said, you should spend 10 years on something and then move on.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:37.000
I had a period when I did a lot of work on regional variation in landscape character.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
So why is the Devon landscape so different to Northamptonshire?

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
OK.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
And so.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Then I got very interested in what happened when Britain ceased to be part of the Roman Empire

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
and whether that was actually a really significant change or not.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
So I had quite a, I had about 10 years studying that.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
So the Dark Ages, you mean?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Yeah, the start of what are traditionally called the Dark Ages.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.000
I think a lot of us would suggest they weren't quite as dark as they used to be.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:18.000
But yeah, what is traditionally seen as being the sort of almost like the end of civilisation in the Roman period.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:30.000
But actually, I think my work hopefully shows that if you were just like a peasant farmer ploughing a few fields and tending a few sheep, not a lot actually changed.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
So I spent a few years sort of studying that.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:47.000
So I sort of I tried to move on from wetlands, not because I didn't enjoy studying them, but just because, you know, a typical academic career is about 40 years.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
And I don't think many academics want to spend 40 years studying exactly the same thing.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
A change is always good, isn't it, I think?

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Yeah, but one of the reasons why I've so enjoyed my involvement in the Living Levels project is that it has brought me back to a landscape that I studied so intensively for two years.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
For two years, that was my whole life.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:20.000
And I've done I do periodically return to some of these wetland landscapes just to do a little bit of work on something that I'm interested in.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Yeah.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
I asked before actually about how much if your work is reliant on aerial views.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Do you have to rely? Is that part of it for you?

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
A bit.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000
The bread and butter is looking at maps because they are available in such detail.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
So what age do you go back to?

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Well, there's good map coverage for the whole country from the 19th century.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Yeah.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:58.000
So sort of middle of the 19th century, there's really detailed maps of pretty much the whole country.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
But some areas there are some earlier maps as well.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
OK, yeah.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
The maps are earlier than aerial photographs.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:17.000
And also aerial photographs, the earliest aerial photographs really from the 1940s.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
OK, yeah.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
But they're pretty fuzzy.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:29.000
But there are there are places where, for example, earthworks, sort of humps and bumps,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.000
they are they show up on aerial photographs from, say, the late 1940s.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
But those earthworks now have been completely ploughed flat.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Yeah.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000
So so yeah, I think to understand the landscape, you've really got to look at absolutely everything you've got at your disposal.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Yeah.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Although I would say it's the maps that are the starting point.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Yeah.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
I mean, maps tell a story all on their own, don't they?

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
I mean, I love a map.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Do you use the oh, gosh, my name's gone, the the internal drainage board maps.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
How far back do they go?

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Yeah.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Yeah.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:22.000
I mean, the the earliest of the maps that show individual fields and buildings and so on are 1830 to 1831.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:30.000
And those were the earliest maps that cover the whole of the grant levels.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
And they are an absolutely remarkable source.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Are they?

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000
So I mean, they were really the starting point of the mapping in my grant levels, historic landscape study.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Really?

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Has there been a high point for you or, you know, punching the air moment for you in all your work down there?

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
On the levels?

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Yeah.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
I don't know, really.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Off the top of my head, I don't think I can.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
I mean, I've had various very memorable moments.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Yeah.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
But I don't think there is quite one punching the air.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:29.000
I mean, I do remember doing a survey of the intertidal area at Magor Pill.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Yeah.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
With John Allen in February.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Oh, God.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
And it was bitterly cold.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:50.000
And that absolutely tested my commitment to archaeology.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Cold and wet.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Yeah, it was that was awful from the conditions, but it was just fascinating.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
You know, spending a week with the great man.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Yeah.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
So interpreting all of this archaeology.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:10.000
So I mean, that was that was a definite sort of highlight.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
But yes, I haven't really got the air punching moment.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
I should probably think of something when we sign off.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Yeah.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:28.000
What about, I'm not sure this is a silly question or not, but the work you do,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
is it something that can be used by?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Let me think I don't ask this question as a way of informing the future.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Because that is what the great levels historic landscape study.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
I mean, that was all about.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:59.000
And it did it fade through to another Caddo Countryside Council for Wales

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
initiative, which was to produce a register of historic landscapes in Wales.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Yeah.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:16.000
And it identified 60 ish landscapes of particular historic importance in Wales,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
one of which is the Gwent levels.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
And so the Gwent levels was the first one of the landscapes in the register to see

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
this sort of really intensive study.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
So yeah, I think that study really did sort of have an impact in terms of raising

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:43.000
the profile of the concept of how important still used landscapes are and the

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
time depth that they have.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
And there was similar work that was done in England as well.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.000
And it was a very exciting period to be sort of working in what at that time was a

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
really new and a really sort of innovative concept.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
The archaeologists shouldn't just be grubbing about in the dirt, but archaeologists

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.000
should be appreciating the historic importance of the landscape all around us.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
I think it's something that we take for granted now.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:25.000
But thinking back to that sort of early mid 1990s, very few archaeologists had any

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:34.000
interest at all in the historic age of fields that they walk through or roads that

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
they drive down.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
They were just roads and fields.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000
They are actually often as old, if not older, than things that archaeologists grub

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
around in the dirt.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
It's so interesting.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Because like you said earlier, it's so relatable, isn't it?

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
It's so relatable.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000
What about have you had to, so you said you've used maps and old documents, Doomsday

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Book.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Have you ever used spoken to locals and asked for their folk memory maybe?

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Well, this is something that I wish I'd done more of in the Great Neville's Historic

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Landscape Study.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
I did talk to Neville Walters.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Oh, wow.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
He's brilliant.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Have you spoken to him?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
I've got one of my best interviews.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000
There was a lady who worked for the Countryside Council for Wales.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:38.000
I think her name was Susan Howard, who was my first point of contact at the Countryside

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Council for Wales, just as Rick Turner was my first point of contact in Caddick.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000
She introduced me to various sort of local people.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
But Neville was the one who I remember I spent quite a bit of time with.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
I spent about half a day with him.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
He drove me around various places.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:06.000
We talked about some of the traditional methods of managing that landscape that he could remember.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:17.000
I remember he told me he was paid something like sixpence for digging a certain length

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
of gripe, these spade dug gullies in the surface of the fields.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
It was something like sixpence for 30 feet a day or something like that.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
That is in that book somewhere.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
I did write that down.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:42.000
What was really nice was we had a big Living Levels event at the, is it called the Lyset Institute?

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Yes, yes.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:50.000
I was sitting at one of the tables and this elderly gentleman sort of walked past and

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
sort of looked at me in that sort of knowing way.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:02.000
I didn't recognise him because this was about 23, 25 years ago.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
He obviously recognised me.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Whether he'd asked somebody, is that Stephen Rippon, I don't know.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
He obviously recognised me and I recognised that he clearly knew me.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
I guessed it might have been him.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
I went out and we had a nice little chat.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:27.000
I wish I'd done more of that.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
The people I did talk to, it was very useful.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:40.000
I found out about the cycle of cleaning out the ditches.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
It's only the major water courses that you would have cleaned out every year.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Then you'd have this cycle of cleaning the minor reams perhaps every three years.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:00.000
The field boundaries, a farmer might just clean out two field boundaries a year.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
They might have something like almost a 30-year cycle, some of them.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Of course, that's how you get the difference in vegetation in these ditches because you get these different times.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Neville told me all about that.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:23.000
It's a particular feature that is of particular interest to you?

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.000
I've always had a soft spot for Whitsun.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Right from the start of my work, it was obviously a very odd block of the landscape.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000
I went so far in unraveling its history and so on.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Of course, that is in the book.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:56.000
I do speculate in the book that it might have been associated with Flemish immigrants.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Why? Really? Why?

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000
We know that Flemings were brought to Pembrokeshire in the 12th century

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:15.000
As part of the English conquest of Wales, they would use colonists to settle land.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
There were a lot of Flemish mercenaries at that time too, weren't there?

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Yes. It's well documented in Pembrokeshire.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
That's interesting.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:35.000
I recognise that the morphology of Whitsun is very similar to villages in the low countries.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Yes.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000
That's as far as I got in the Gwent levels historic landscape study.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000
How interesting.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:51.000
I gave a lecture at the University of Ghent probably about six years ago now.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Yes.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:02.000
One of their brighter master students came up to me afterwards and said he was interested in...

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000
I had a slide about Whitsun and wondered if it was Flemish.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Yes.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000
This student, Gerven, went on to do it as his PhD.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Wow, really?

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000
He has found morphological similarities.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Yes.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:35.000
There's a local historian that Mark Lewis knows about who has found some links in the documents with a Flemish family who held Whitsun.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
How curious.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000
It's one of the exciting things about being an academic.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Yes.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:50.000
You do have to brace yourself for the fact that sometimes what you say is proved right, sometimes it's proved wrong.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
It's so nice when it's proved right though, isn't it?

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Yes.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:06.000
But I think those early speculations probably have been proved right through Gerven's PhD and also the research of this historian.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:20.000
I was thinking, Steve, I won't take much longer, looking at the Wendt Lug levels, which has been massively developed, how do you do your work there?

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Are you able to do anything there?

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:35.000
The interest in the Wendt Lug level, and this goes back to John Allen again, he found a lot of Roman material.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Off of what's called Rumney Great Wharf.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
It's a cardiff end.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:51.000
The Wendt Lug level has got this very strange landscape of lots of long, narrow fields, blocks sort of next to each other.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000
It looks like it could be Roman in date.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000
It's just gradually getting covered in development.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
It's a great loss.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.000
One of the things that I have learned is that you do, however, have to pull back.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:20.000
If you got terribly upset by every development in every landscape that you'd ever studied, you'd just be a manic depressive.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000
You're right.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000
You have to detach yourself, don't you?

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:33.000
You do, but when I go back to the Wendt levels, I do get a great pang of affection.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:43.000
But it is very sad to see that some areas, some bits of it are getting developed.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:56.000
I think if there had been a positive from the M4 diversion, it might have drawn a line on the map that the planners could have said, no more.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000
I'm not developing south of that line.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.000
I had this discussion with various people about the pros and cons of that motorway.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000
It would have taken some land from the levels.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:19.000
I just wondered whether it might have drawn a line and no development would have been permitted south of it.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000
I don't know.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Because the problem with the Wendt Lughe level really is it's the development spilling in from the Cardiff area.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
There's just nothing to stop it.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
I fear for Wendt Lughe.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:45.000
I think it will go the way of the Avon levels near Bristol, which they're just getting covered in development as well.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
There's not very little space there now, is there?

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Yeah, there doesn't seem to be much space there anyway.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Can I just ask you quickly about the drainage?

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000
So you would be looking at that evidence of that as well in your landscape?

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Yeah.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000
So to me, it seemed terribly complicated.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
So how have you managed to work that out?

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Is that by referring to the drainage maps?

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:18.000
A lot of it was actually quite obvious just by walking around the landscape talking to Susan Howard all those years ago.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:27.000
The way that the drainage system works hasn't fundamentally changed for a thousand years.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000
It's gravity led.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Yeah.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:40.000
There's not the pumping that you get, for example, on the Somerset levels and have had on the Somerset levels for many hundreds of years.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:47.000
So it's just a gravity fed system where you know the Monks did.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Yes.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000
You see that?

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:58.000
That is one of the channels that is designed to take streams flowing off of the uplands across the levels without flooding them.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
That deals with that problem.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Yeah.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Then you've got to deal with all the wet stuff falling out of the sky, the rain.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Yeah.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
And that's why you have the gripes.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Yeah.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:14.000
They take their water into the field boundary ditches, the field boundary ditches drain into the reams.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Yeah.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.000
And reams then discharge their waters under the seawall through those tidal sluices.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
So it's a very simple system.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Yeah.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000
It's wonderfully simple.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:33.000
But it's sophisticated because the land is lower away from the seawall, isn't it?

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
So it's effectively going up, isn't it?

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Well, no, you just have to dig the ditches deeper and deeper as you go towards the coast.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Right.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Yes.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Yeah.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
That's the thing.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:55.000
See, the other feature, which means that it works, is because of the huge tidal range of the seven estuary.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Yeah.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:07.000
So what basically happens is that when the tide is high, the flap on those tidal gates is foreshut.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.000
So all the water is held in the drainage ditches in the levels.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:25.000
But then you get this long period when the tide goes down, the tidal gates can open and you then get this very long period when all the water can flow out.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Yeah.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:34.000
So if you had a much smaller tidal range, those tidal flaps could end up being closed for much longer.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Right.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000
OK.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Yeah.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
They were actually really closed for a relatively short period of the day.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Yeah.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:51.000
So that's also why this gravity fed system can work, because enough of the water can get out.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Yeah.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Quite quickly.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Do you know the movements of the seven, you know, it's ebbing and flowing and all that.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Is that something that's of interest to landscape archaeologists like you?

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
It's a natural phenomenon.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Yeah.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Of course, it's instrumental to the wetlands having been created.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:21.000
But you do get wetland landscapes like that, for example, around the Thames Estuary that has a much, much smaller tidal range.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Yeah.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Much, much smaller.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Yeah.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
So it's interesting.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000
But.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Just in the background, really.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000
In the background.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Yeah.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Yeah.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Steve, I've kept you far too long.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000
I'm really sorry.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000
It's been so interesting.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:46.000
I'm going to type this up and I'll send it to you so you can look through and cross things out or correct me.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.000
And if I wanted to ask any extra questions, I'll put it on that if that's OK with you.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Yeah, that's fine.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Is that all right?

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Yeah.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Yeah, I'm sure there's something I've forgotten to ask.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000
A glaring gap.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
But thank you so much.

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000
It's so interesting.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
That's great.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Yeah.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Yeah.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Okey dokey.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Thank you so much.
