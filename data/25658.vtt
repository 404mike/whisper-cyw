Truck 7, The Ravine. Hard conditions require hard men.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We're on a plateau here, more or less, about 500 meters high. In the ice age this would have all been covered by an ice sheet.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
When the ice started to melt, the ice sheet retreated, you got little lakes forming at the edge of the ice.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Glass Lin is a remnant of one of those lakes, really. Just a little glacial pond left behind in a little dip.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
There was a huge amount of water released when the ice melted, and that poured over the edge of the escarpment

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and carved out deep ravines like the one we've got just to the right of the reserve,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
which now only has a small stream in it, but it would have had hundreds of thousands of gallons of water

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
pouring down there at the end of the ice age, cutting it deeply down in through the gravel.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
A lot of this surface is gravel and stone left from the ice sheet melting.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Beneath the glacial gravel, mudstones and shales, hundreds of millions of years old, form the underlying geology.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
These were affected by volcanic activity further north, and contain veins of valuable minerals,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000
mostly lead and zinc with some silver. Hence the large-scale lead mining activity at the Livet on the Mountain Road.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This road, from which you gained access to the Winford-Born Thomas Memorial, is the only significant visual legacy of this mining.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Life for the men that worked there was very hard, and mining would not be their only employment,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
as Yeston discovered when reading a miner's diary.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And you'd say you'd get up at five in the morning, go and do something like a 14-hour shift in the mine,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
then go and help out with the shearing, then go home and do some work on his own farm,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
then go to bed and then get up the next morning and do that six days a week.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And you just think, how on earth, you know, the strength of these men to do that day in, day out, all year round,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
you know, it just beggars belief, and people complain they've got a hard life nowadays,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and they think, yeah right, you don't know how lucky we are, honestly, we really don't.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You read some of these stories and you think they were hard, hard men.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The birds around here are a bit feisty too.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
From ground nesters such as the red grouse and skylark, to the more predatory hen harrier and merlin,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
each raise its young in the often wild conditions.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The peregrine falcon, the world's most widespread bird of prey,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
can also be found nesting on the steep crags of the ravine.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
However, you are more likely to hear its screeching call than catch a glimpse.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
In mid-dive, it can reach speeds of 200 miles an hour, making it the fastest animal in the world.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Two further birds of prey commonly spotted here are buzzards and their fork-tailed cousins, the red kite.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I always think buzzards are a bit more Lancaster bomber-like in their shape, they're a bit heftier,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
particularly when next to a red kite.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Red kite is the long, lanky looking bird, whereas the buzzard is a bit sort of stocky and heavily built,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and a bit more oomph to it more or less.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Just a reminder to retrace your steps back to stop 6.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Turn right and follow the shoreline of the lake.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Listen to track 8 after crossing the small wooden boardwalk bridge and passing through the wooden kissing gate.
