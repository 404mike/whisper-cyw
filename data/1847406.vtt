00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
Okay, so today is the 15th of October 2019. This is Dr. Adeola Dowers.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.840
Can you say your full name for the recording?

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.840
I'm Raphael Martin.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.760
And where were you born?

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.760
Cardiff.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.760
And what was your date of birth?

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.760
I was born the 8th of June 1964 in St. David's Hospital.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.260
Okay.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Riverside, that's where I come from.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.440
Okay, all right. And we're talking today about a bit about your dad.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.840
So he is, he qualifies as somebody who comes from the Wind First Generation.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.840
Yeah, my father came over here in 1951 to Birmingham.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.840
I wasn't born in.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
I might look that old, but no, I wasn't born.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.840
Where did he come from?

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.840
Oh, Jamaica.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840
And do you know his birth date?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.840
My dad was born on the 19th of September 1917.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.240
That's the beginning of the First World War.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.240
Yeah.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.240
Yeah, all the end of the end, yeah, start of the First World War.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.240
He'd been 102 if he was alive today, just the other day.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.240
Did he ever talk about what Jamaica was like?

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
My father died when I was 13, so I don't remember a lot.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.240
But I remember like when there was a conversation and I was listening.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.240
And they said they never knew what depression was till they come to this country.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.240
I remember they said there was no depression in obviously talking about Jamaica.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.640
So people weren't depressed in Jamaica, it just didn't happen.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.640
They didn't know what the word meant, they were telling me.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.640
While they were talking, you know, so I remember that.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.640
And when they used to talk about Jamaica, because I went to Jamaica,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.640
and I thought I went in about 2006, I think.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.640
Yeah, 2006 I think I went to Jamaica.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.640
And when I went to Jamaica, it was for miles per square mile.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.040
It was more murders in Jamaica at that time, per square mile.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.040
I think I went in February than any other country in the world at that time.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.040
So when I went, even though it was sort of okay where I was,

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.040
it's not a nice country at that time.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.040
And now it's not getting better.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.040
But when my parents used to talk about Jamaica, they made it sound like it was paradise.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.040
And I went to this place called...

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.440
What's it called?

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440
Oh, I'm seeing this place in Jamaica.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.440
Can't remember the name of the place right now.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440
If I do later, I'll let you know.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.440
But it was so nice.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.440
I thought, well, this is the Jamaica that my parents used to talk about.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.440
The people were just... I think it was called Hanover.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440
I think it was Hanover.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440
And I mean, the people were just...

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.440
I mean, you know, it was just so nice.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.440
I mean, everyone was really nice.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.440
I remember I went in the market.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.840
And I like haggling.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.840
I like doing a little bit of hustling.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.840
I think I'm a good hustler.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.840
So I went in the shop in the market.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.840
And there was this man.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.840
And I wanted this...

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.840
I think it was only a map of Jamaica in a frame.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840
And I said, how much is that?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.840
And he said, like, $30.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.840
I said, no, how much is it to a Jamaican?

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.840
If you're a Jamaican.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.840
He said, listen, if you're white, you're black, you're Jamaican, you're Chinese,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.840
it's still $30.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.840
You know, and I thought...

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.840
He's just saying, like, in that place, it's like it doesn't matter.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
We just do things equal.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.840
And I like that.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.840
I didn't buy it because I...

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.840
But I did like that.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.840
So, yeah, that's all I really know about Jamaica.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.840
Oh, no, no, obviously Jamaica.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.840
I mean, the food is beautiful.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.840
And things like that.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.840
And, you know, the sea is clean.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840
You know, it's just...

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840
When I went to...

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.840
When you go to Jamaica,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.240
obviously the West Indies,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.240
and you come back to this country,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.240
and you eat the food,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.240
the food tastes like cardboard.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.240
I mean, that's one thing I noticed.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.240
So, you know, obviously, like I remember when I was a child,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.240
there used to be a man, his name was Green.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.240
Mr. Green, used to call him.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.240
Because he called everyone like their titles,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.240
like Mr., Mrs.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.240
You never used first names when I was a child.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.240
And you had to...

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.240
Obviously, you had to respect people.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.640
Good morning.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.640
You know, Mr. This or Mr. That.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.640
It's not like slack like it is today.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.640
But anyway, he used to come and visit,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.640
not just us, but the West Indian people.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.640
And he used to sell the proper West Indian food.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.640
The yam, you know, green bananas,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.640
the ackee, the saltfish.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.640
People didn't know what that was in them days.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.640
People do now.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.640
So, I used to like...

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.640
We had the hard dough bread.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.640
I used to like the bullet cake.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.640
Oh, I used to love the bullet cake.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.040
My dad used to like sugar cane.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.040
You could buy these sugar cane drinks.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.040
You know, things like that.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.040
And remember that, this cocoa, chocolate.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.040
And it was like solid, it was together.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.040
And then you grate it and you make the chocolate drink.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.040
But my dad died when I was 13.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.040
So, I, you know, go back a long, long, long, long...

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040
Not that I'm that old, old.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.040
But I go back a long way to try and have the memories.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.040
You know, and...

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.040
Yeah, so...

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.040
How old was your dad when he came over?

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.040
My dad was 33.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.440
I'm like the same age as Jesus.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.440
Started the first church in Birmingham.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.440
And then...

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.440
And then, that was 1951.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.440
I think my mother come 1952.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.440
But what it was, like we were talking earlier on,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.440
in them days, you know, they didn't...

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.440
They weren't sort of welcome at churches.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.440
The white churches.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.440
They were all...

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.440
Churches owned by white people,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.440
mostly in them days.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.440
And they, you know, kept to themselves.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.840
Very closed shop.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.840
You know, so when a black person come,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.840
they taught the field like an outcast.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.840
Even though people are supposed to be Christians.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.840
So, it was easy then,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.840
for black people to start churches.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.840
Because in Jamaica, there's more churches

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.840
per square mile again

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.840
than any other country in the world in Jamaica.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.840
More churches per square mile.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.840
So, obviously they come here

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.840
and it's practically a Christian country,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.840
Jamaica.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.840
So, they come here and they still want the

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.840
fellowship and worship and do like they've done in Jamaica.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.240
But West Indians,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.240
when my dad had his church

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.240
in Cardiff, Antwerp, other one in Cardiff,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.240
I noticed like they're very vibrant.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.240
They had a lot of life.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.240
And when a lot of people,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.240
English people

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.240
or Welsh people, British people,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.240
they're very stiff.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.240
The British stiff up a lip, I suppose.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.240
But the thing is, what's funny, I'm like that, see?

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.240
I'm like, I'm more English

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.240
than Jamaican.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.240
I might act more like a Jamaican in my

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.640
characteristics.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.640
But I like being quiet and calm in church

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.640
whereas West Indian people

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.640
when it comes to church time,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.640
it's like Sister Act, they jump, they dance, they sing.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.640
All different languages.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.640
Because to them, they speak in tongues.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.640
It's like speaking in English.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.640
Whereas English people or British

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.640
people in them days,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.640
a lot of them didn't even

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.640
accept it properly.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.640
Even though a lot of English churches

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.640
were Pentecostal.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.040
I remember going to the city temple

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.040
when I was really young.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.040
I'm talking the 70s.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.040
To me, it was like

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.040
not much different to Methodist, Baptist.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.040
I didn't find much difference.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.040
They talk about it was lively and this was happening.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.040
Yeah, a lot of people might have been going

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.040
and the Spirit of God was moving.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.040
But it never had the life

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.040
that our church had.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.040
And I remember

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.040
I spoke to this lady.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.040
I used to be a youth manager

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.440
at the Beacon Centre.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.440
There was a lady there and her son was

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.440
in a bit of trouble so I used to go over and talk

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.440
to the people sometimes.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.440
I was talking to this lady and then

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.440
she actually said,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.440
she used to go to my dad's church.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.440
My dad's church was in Welles Street.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.440
So I thought to myself,

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.440
let me ask this white lady what it was like.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.440
Because there wasn't loads of white people in our church.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.440
So I thought

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.440
to myself, let me ask her what she thought about it.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.440
So I said, what did you think of it?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.840
I thought it was good on holiday.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.840
Because obviously

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.840
women especially

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.840
I think they like dancing and moving

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.840
and our church was sort of like that.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.840
So yeah,

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.840
nowadays people try and make church

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.840
entertaining.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.840
And I don't think church should be entertaining.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.840
I think church should be so warm.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.840
It should be so welcoming.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.840
It should be the place that people want to go

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.840
because they know that

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.840
God is there.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.240
I mean

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.240
for me as a Christian, I believe

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.240
it's God who gives us life. It's like your parents

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.240
they give you life.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.240
And I think you should respect them because they're your parents.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.240
And I think it's the same with God

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.240
because he gives us life.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.240
We should show respect

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.240
women in his house and do everything we can

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.240
to get to know him.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.240
So how

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.240
challenging was it for your father

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.240
to open a church? He said that at that time

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.240
it was

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.640
for people who weren't white

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.640
to open churches.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.640
But was it an easy process?

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.640
Well, listen

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.640
this is all I know because I

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.640
obviously wasn't born when they did

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.640
their churches.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.640
But my dad, he had the first black Pentecostal

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.640
church in Wales.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.640
And

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.640
like why I say it was easy

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.640
was my father

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.640
he always had big houses

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.640
so my dad must have been okay back

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.040
and over here

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.040
when the West Indians came here

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.040
they put them as laborers, they wouldn't give them their titles

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.040
my dad was a stonemason

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.040
and I remember I said to my mother

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.040
one day I said

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.040
mom, how did dad buy his first house?

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.040
You know, just ask that question.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.040
And she said

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.040
she was Jewish

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.040
I didn't know my mother was Jewish until this day

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.040
so she said

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.040
what happened? Your dad wanted to buy this house

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.040
but in them days they wanted to sell houses

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.040
to black people and stuff, they were very funny.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.040
So my father wanted to buy this house

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.040
and they wouldn't

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.040
they wanted to sell him the house

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.040
and the man was Jewish

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.040
and my dad said to the man, he said my wife is Jewish

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.040
so that's

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.040
how my dad was able to buy his first house.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.040
And then

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.040
I said to my mom, I said well

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.040
obviously why did dad lie?

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.040
Because I didn't know.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.040
And she said well she's Jewish, that's why I found out we were Jewish.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.040
And the original Jewish people

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.040
they're black anyway, they're dark.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.040
So you didn't know your mom was Jewish all the time?

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.040
My mother never ever mentioned that she was Jewish

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.040
because she was really humble, really calm

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.040
and very loving

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.040
and I thought all women were like that.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.040
But anyway

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.040
yeah, no, she never mentioned it

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.040
I suppose she never

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.040
needed to.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.040
I think a lot of people in them days didn't realize

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.040
that the Jewish people

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.040
were sort of set apart by God

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.040
I don't think that black people

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.040
really want to acknowledge that.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.040
God chose the Jewish people

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.040
and he's put a special anointing on the Jewish people

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.040
I believe

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.040
and at the end time when Jesus

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.040
comes back, he's going to be

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.040
dealing with the Jewish people.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.040
And the

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.040
Bible calls it

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.040
the time of the Gentiles will be fulfilled

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.040
there's going to be a time I believe

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.040
when God says, okay, the Gentiles

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.040
the non-Jewish people have had their time.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.040
You know, and because

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.040
first salvation was for the Jews

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.040
and then the non-Jews

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.040
come in and the non-Jews

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.040
they were happy to receive it because

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.040
really God is here for everybody

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.040
He's not here for the Jews, He's not here

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.040
for the blacks, He's not here for the whites, He's here for everybody

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.040
and He always has been

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.040
you know, and

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.040
but He used the line

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.040
like He used it to Christians

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.040
to let people see Him.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.040
So because the Jews were out of order

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.040
and doing all wrong and sort of going off track

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.040
there was a time when God

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.040
knew like, you know

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.040
it just had to be for everybody

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.040
and now we're in a time for everybody.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.040
So, like my parents

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.040
when they come here as black people

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.040
loving Jesus, you know

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.040
a lot of people talk about God but obviously

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.040
Jesus. And

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.040
the people

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.040
who are from the West Indies, they used to come to our big houses

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.040
my dad always had big houses

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.040
and because they used to stay there

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.040
because a lot of people used to stay in people's houses

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.040
so it was easy. So a lot of people knew my parents

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.040
like when I was younger

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.040
I felt like we knew everybody

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.040
you know, I thought there wouldn't be

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.040
a black person that we don't know.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.040
Like my dad I remember

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.040
used to drive thinking down the

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.040
docks, we used to go up the valleys

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.040
there's a story

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.040
that I

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.040
found out in the last say

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.040
ten years. Because I used to go

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.040
to this church in Murfittidville

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.040
and there was a man

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.040
the church I used to go, God sent me to the church

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.040
God said you need to go to this church

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.040
so I ended up going to the church in Murfitt

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.040
Anyway, I got to this church in Murfitt

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.040
and the man who was preaching

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.040
in this church, I thought

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.040
I'm sure I've seen this man before

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.040
Now my dad died when I was 13, right?

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.040
So these people I would have known if I knew them

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.040
when I was really young. So anyways

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.040
I started talking to this man and he said

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.040
I used to go to your dad's church

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.040
So, so when we were talking

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.040
and I go over his house, I meet him

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.040
and then he introduced me to his brother

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.040
So I'm speaking to his brother

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.040
The mother is still alive, she must be about 100

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.040
So I'm speaking to the brother

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.040
and the brother says, I want to tell you something

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.040
He said I was a sexton

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.040
I don't know what that was, but that's

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.040
someone who works in the cemetery, I think

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.040
who looks after the graves and all that, I think that's a sexton

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.040
And he said after

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.040
the

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.040
the Abba

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.040
Abba Van is it, the landslide

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.040
1966

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.040
So your dad, he came up and he was praying and everything

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.040
here

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.040
and he said, and then he was at the

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.040
cemetery at the graveyard

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.040
and he said, and we were talking

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.040
and he said to me, do you want to

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.040
live at home? So I said

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.040
yes

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.040
So he said

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.040
I ended up going back to your parents house

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.040
having fellowship, having prayer meeting

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.040
He said, but then at some point your dad

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.040
brought you people

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.040
up to, whatever he was

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.040
I don't know if I should say Murfa, whatever it was

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.040
and he said

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.040
you're all black, all your

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.040
children come out the van and everyone was looking

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.040
like who are they, because they've never really seen black people before

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.040
You know, you're

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.040
in stories like that

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.040
Yeah, I remember that

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.040
I remember when I was a child, we used to go

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.040
to different places in the valleys and

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.040
everything, and I used to think

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.040
these people are strange, they used to keep chickens out

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.040
of their back gardens and all things like that

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.040
I remember that, you know

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.040
I wish I would have listened more

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.040
because I wasn't interested obviously as a child

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.040
you're not interested in what big people are talking about

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.040
but I wish I would have really listened

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.040
and sort of learned more

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.040
about their culture, where they come from

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.040
and things, you know

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.040
because Wales is so known for

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.040
Christianity, for revival

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.040
Was your mother from Jamaica as well?

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.040
My mother was born in Jamaica, but my mother is

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.040
Jewish by birth, because it comes down to the woman side

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.040
which means I'm Jewish by birth

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.040
I'm not Jewish at all, but

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.040
I'm Jewish by birth

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.040
It sort of helps you

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.040
if you go to the synagogue or if you go to Israel

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.040
because when you say you're Jewish, they don't care

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.040
you could be green

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.040
you say you're Jewish and all of a sudden you're part of their family

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.040
It's like when I was a child

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.040
when I was in the church

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.040
with the black people, black people

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.040
accept you as family, you know

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.040
when I was a child you go to the houses

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.040
and they feed you, you know

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.040
they look after you, it's just

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.040
I mean, yeah, some of the white people were like that

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.040
but with a black person

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.040
that's just the way it was

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.040
you know, if you're black and somebody comes in

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.040
you feed them, you know

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.040
that's what I remember

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.040
You said that your father came over first

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.040
and then your mother came over

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.040
Do you have brothers and sisters? Did they have children?

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.040
in Jamaica before they came with her?

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.040
I've got two sisters that are born in Jamaica

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.040
one just died last year

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.040
in November, we buried her in December

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.040
my oldest sister, she's

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.040
alive now, she's in her

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.040
late sixties

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.040
they were the only two born in Jamaica

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.040
and like I said

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.040
I've visited, my young brothers visited

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.040
a few of us have visited

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.040
Jamaica because

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.040
I mean, I don't know, it's strange

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.040
when I was a child I actually

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.040
got a Jamaican passport

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.040
I got a Jamaican passport

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.040
now the reason I've done that is because I used to be

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.040
the police used to give me so much trouble

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.040
and everybody used to sort of

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.040
give me trouble

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.040
because when you're black, you know

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.040
in them days, it wasn't

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.040
you were different

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.040
you was different because you're in a class

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.040
of 30 people and you're the only black person

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.040
just saying

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.040
so I felt so uncomfortable

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.040
I felt so out of place, I thought

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.040
if I get a Jamaican passport when people are rude

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.040
and cheeky to me, at least I'll know I'm not

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.040
a Welsh person, British person

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.040
I used to just feel like that

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.040
everybody has their thing and that was my thing to help me cope

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.040
because you've got to cope with things

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.040
either you're going to kill people or they're going to kill you

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.040
because I'm

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.040
was never the sort of person

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.040
to sit down

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.040
and take rubbish, I don't

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.040
never have taken rubbish, I don't take rubbish

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.040
because my parents

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.040
used to teach me, everybody's the same

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.040
doesn't matter if you're white, red, yellow

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.040
it makes no difference, you're all the same, God made everybody equal

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.040
and then I'd go outside the house

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.040
and then I'd speak all the words

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.040
all these names

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.040
I don't even think they're

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.040
in the dictionary

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.040
some of the names they used to call me

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.040
so I used to be mad

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.040
and it made me angry

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.040
and I just wouldn't take rubbish

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.040
so I used to think to myself, if you want

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.040
to think you can be cheeky to me

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.040
you better be able to fight me

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.040
because I'm going to beat you

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.040
I used to think like that, so when I was younger

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.040
I used to have a lot of problems in school

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.040
I used to have a lot of trouble

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.040
and thank God

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.040
I've had problems, like my dad

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.040
come and speak to the headmaster

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.040
because I used to

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.040
I mean it's terrible, I used to get caned every day

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.040
I don't think a day

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.040
ever went by

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.040
from when I couldn't remember going to school

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.040
until I was about 14

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.040
without getting the cane

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.040
I got caned every single day

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.040
because I was always the fault

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.040
if I would get jumped by 3 people, 4 people

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.040
I would always end up getting caned

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.040
but when I got older, when I was about 14

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.040
I used to be able to beat people so bad

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.040
that they couldn't cane me no more

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.040
so I never got caned from when I was about 14

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.040
because I used to beat the people so bad

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.040
that I'd say, I remembered

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.040
if there's trouble

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.040
the other person has got to get in trouble too

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.040
so they used to be so bad

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.040
they couldn't do nothing

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.040
because I used to say, what about them

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.040
if you're going to cane me, you've got to cane them

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.040
so I should laugh anyway

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.040
but that's why I stopped getting caned

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.040
so when I was 14 I got caned again

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.040
so basically, that just sounds really

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.040
unjust, doesn't it?

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.040
you were picked on

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.040
and attacked

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.040
and beaten

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.040
by the headmaster or whatever

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.040
that doesn't make any sense, does it?

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.040
but that's the system

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.040
it's strange

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.040
I see it like this, as I'm talking to you now

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.040
you have a mother, not all mothers

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.040
but most mothers

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.040
them children can do no wrong

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.040
so because the white people

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.040
were their children, their children

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.040
can do no wrong

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.040
I used to feel like they used to try and beat me

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.040
or cause me problems

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.040
because I was a net child

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.040
I was different

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.040
apparently a friend of mine told me

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.040
he said to me, I found out this

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.040
this year I think I found this out

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.040
he said that the teachers were so worried about me

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.040
so frightened of me

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.040
they used to ask the other children, can any of them fight me

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.040
so they can come in the classroom with me

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.040
and if I cause trouble they can keep me camp

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.040
that's what the teachers used to ask the pupils

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.040
I found out this year

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.040
how does that make you feel?

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.040
well it's funny, because I look back

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.040
when I was younger and I was wild

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.040
I didn't care, that was just how it was

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.040
but when I look back I just think

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.040
it was real child abuse

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.040
because if you hurt a child now

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.040
the parent will go to prison

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.040
but yet I was a child

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.040
just like everybody else

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.040
but I was black

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.040
and I used to get all beaten and all trouble

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.040
all things just happened to me

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.040
I was black

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.040
I remember once I was walking

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.040
through Sapphire Gardens

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.040
that's in Riverside where I lived

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.040
and I was walking home and I was with one of my friends

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.040
and he was back in and out of prison

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.040
he was a rough guy

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.040
and we were walking and there was

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.040
two police, police come up in a car

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.040
they come out the car

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.040
and I said to my friend, I said I'm not stopping

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.040
because you know I'm going to get in trouble

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.040
so he stopped and I just walked off

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.040
and anyway they just called me back

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.040
and I was walking and my friend was a criminal

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.040
and then they picked on me

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.040
and he put his hands in my pocket

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.040
and squeezed me

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.040
so I punched him I did, the policeman

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.040
and then he, you know I automatically

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.040
didn't, well anyway

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.040
because I don't take burbish anyway

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.040
so he took me home to my mother

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.040
and then you know and then I

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.040
that's I didn't get any trouble for it

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.040
because he probably knew what he'd done

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.040
and as I say I just got in trouble

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.040
with my mum then but

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.040
I was good, you know, because I never done nothing

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.040
you know and things like that

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.040
I mean that's just one, I mean I've been

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.040
I remember I got

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.040
pulled over, obviously my car

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.040
plenty of times, I used to drive

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.040
stopped, harassed

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.040
I remember once

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.040
and this was in the last say eight years

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.040
I was

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.040
I dropped off my cousin in Lamarmy

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.040
and I was driving to

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.040
back to St Melan's

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.040
and then the police, I see them follow me

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.040
they follow me to Lamarmy

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.040
and then they see me

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.040
drop off my cousin and then they follow me

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.040
I was with my ex

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.040
they follow me back

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.040
to the house and then

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.040
they pulled up behind me, obviously they knew where I was

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.040
it wasn't that long ago, they checked the number plate and everything

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.040
but I was in a bad mood because they followed me

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.040
and I was just really angry

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.040
so

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.040
they come out the car because I always

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.040
I used to keep my documents with me

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.040
but anyway

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.040
so they said to me

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.040
I've got your documents

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.040
and I was in such a bad mood I said

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.040
no I haven't got my documents, just give me a producer

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.040
so he looked at me

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.040
this police man, he must have seen me in real world

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.040
went round the producer and just went

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.040
you know that was good

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.040
I was in a bad mood

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.040
because we're human at the end of the day

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.040
when we get

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.040
because when we're young

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.040
we don't really understand racism

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.040
a lot, I don't think, you know, how deep it is

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.040
and how bad it is because

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.040
we might just think

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.040
I don't know, it's just like we don't

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.040
think deep, I didn't think, I want to think

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.040
I never thought, but when I got older

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.040
and I started, like I said, I thought

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.040
when they picked on me and gave me

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.040
trouble when I was a child

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.040
that's the same as picking on a little white child

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.040
but because I was black they didn't

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.040
care, they treated me like I was an animal

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.040
so when I look back and I think how can an adult

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.040
how can I be an adult and want to

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.040
be through or cause trouble until like 8

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.040
6 year old, 6 year old, so because my mind

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.040
thinks different now

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.040
it's different now when I get stopped or when someone

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.040
says something to me, you know, I'll think to myself

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.040
why is he saying that?

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.040
what's the reason behind that?

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
I got married, I had a family

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.040
I was in London and in London

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.040
they understand the program

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.040
there's areas where there's black love, black

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.040
people, black white, they mix

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.040
and it's not too bad, in certain areas they understand

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.040
so I come

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.040
back to Cardiff and when I come back to Cardiff

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.040
got saved, come to Cardiff

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.040
and then my wife wasn't well

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.040
and I went to social services

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.040
the next thing I know they take my children off me

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.040
I went to them for help and they take

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.040
my children off me and until this

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.040
day I still haven't gotten back

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.040
so I made

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.040
complaints, they found social services

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.040
done wrong, but they still let

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.040
them keep my children, they even

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.040
when I went to social services, when I went

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.040
there in 1998

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.040
you know there was no black people in the social

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.040
services where I was

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.040
in St Melons, so I made a complaint

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.040
and then I said to them

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.040
I want to go with this black guy, there was one black

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.040
social worker and you know they waited

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.040
until the court case was finished

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.040
before they'd even look

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.040
into it and then they said no, I'm not moving you

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.040
over there, it was really bad, they gave me a lot of trouble

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.040
I mean this government, this

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.040
I mean you get people out of OK

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.040
but the system is very

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.040
very very racist

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.040
even today, not

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.040
long ago I was talking to one of my friends

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.040
my white friends and he said to me

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.040
he said you know they're still racist, a lot

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.040
of racism, he said you know we don't say it to your face

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.040
but we're still you know

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.040
so even though it doesn't seem

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.040
as bad and the only reason

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.040
it doesn't seem as bad I believe

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.040
is because they're catering

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.040
for everybody, you see these homosexuals

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.040
they could cater for

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.040
homosexuals, bisexuals,

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.040
transgender, all this sort of stuff

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.040
they cater for anything

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.040
they don't care, you can be anything now

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.040
and because of that they know they've got to be OK with black people

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.040
if it wasn't for these like all these

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.040
feminist movements

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.040
or the be good to dogs

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.040
if it wasn't for all that, they'd still be

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.040
treating black people like animals

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.040
because you know people are still people

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.040
it's just like now they know they've got to watch

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.040
themselves because you say boo

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.040
to a black man and it'll get you over racism

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.040
now, so that's where

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.040
we are now, but I've moved a long way haven't I

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.040
really

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.040
so what I'll do

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.040
what I'll do, let me go back

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.040
to what it was like in the church

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.040
and I thought you know let me go back to some of that

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.040
I'll go back to some of that

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.040
so when I was a child I remember like my parents

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.040
used to wake us up in the mornings

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.040
and we used to have to praise God

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.040
and pray and all that before we went to school

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.040
before we'd done anything

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.040
my parents they were very very

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.040
religious

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.040
you know, Christians, proper, I mean

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.040
proper, on Sunday I mean

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.040
that's just it man, you don't watch

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.040
anything TV, no, we're just all

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.040
pure Jesus

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.040
from day start

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.040
to day night, you know

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.040
and my mother she used to tell me

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.040
sometimes we'd go to church when we were babies

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.040
and we'd fall asleep in our arms and stuff like that

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.040
because the whole day, Sunday

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.040
is church day, you know

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.040
and it was like that and

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.040
I remember

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.040
you know

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.040
we had to read the Bible

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.040
we had to learn the Lord's Prayer

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.040
and the 23rd Psalms

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.040
and

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.040
our parents always taught us like

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.040
you be good, you do right

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.040
you don't steal, you don't cheat, I don't swear

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.040
I've only swore about maybe five times in my life

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.040
the first time I ever swore was telling

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.040
a joke

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.040
and my friend said to me, why did you swear? I said that's the joke

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.040
isn't it? You know it's like really weird

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.040
you know so

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.040
but it was funny because when I was a child

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.040
I used to think white people were strange

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.040
and because I used to go to my friend's house

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.040
and they all, they drink, they smoke, they swear

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.040
they do what people do

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.040
so I think white people are strange

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.040
and then when I got older and I became a Christian

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.040
I realised it wasn't so much white people that were strange

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.040
it was because we were Christians

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.040
brought up strict a certain way

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.040
so we were probably strange to everybody else

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.040
and I'm thinking, oh them white people they're strange

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.040
how can they swear and smoke

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.040
why would they take cigarettes in their mums and stuff

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.040
you know I couldn't understand

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.040
so it was really funny when I looked back on it

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.040
you know but I have obviously

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.040
you know as a Christian

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.040
and as a person you know I

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.040
I do realise

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.040
you know people are people

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.040
it's just like you know I think

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.040
in my generation

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.040
we were treated bad and the government

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.040
allowed us to be treated

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.040
bad and I think that's a big difference

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.040
now but

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.040
you know I mean I've spoken to some

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.040
people and you know white people

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.040
and you can see they see no difference

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.040
I used to find it strange

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.040
you know when I moved to London

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.040
and I come back and

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.040
because in Cardiff

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.040
people always, when I was here

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.040
white people always seemed to talk down to me

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.040
but then when I got obviously

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.040
I was older and I come back to Cardiff in 1998

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.040
I realised people

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.040
really

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.040
were talking to me like I was a normal human being

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.040
and I was sort of, you know I had to get used to that

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.040
you know because when I was younger

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.040
I was always used to being talked down to

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.040
so what is that then? Why was that

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.040
change happening?

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.040
Well I think obviously I was

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.040
older because I was only about 18

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.040
when I left Cardiff

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.040
I left in 1983, 84

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.040
18, 19

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.040
it was more racist

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.040
it was much more racist, much more prejudice

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.040
but now you've got like I said

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.040
you can beat whatever, in fact

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.040
if you're

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.040
a transgender you probably

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.040
get more respect than a black man

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.040
you know because

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.040
there's fashions in it, it's just strange

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.040
and you know people are people

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.040
and I've got nothing against people

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.040
I do personally think some things are wrong

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.040
but I think

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.040
we can do wrong because

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.040
God will never

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.040
say, well he won't

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.040
kill us for doing wrong really, it's just like when we die

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.040
we have to answer for what we do

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.040
but you know people are people and we've got to

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.040
understand, I think to myself

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.040
why should I, or why should black people

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.040
I'm just talking now

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.040
why should black people

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.040
treat white people bad when we

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.040
black people know what it's like to be treated

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.040
bad, I'm like that, I think like you know we need

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.040
to treat everyone with respect and love don't we

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.040
that's just how we should be

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.040
you know

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.040
Tell me about the Jamaican

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.040
identity then, because when you were little

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.040
you had a Jamaican passport because you didn't feel

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.040
like you fitted in and you know

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.040
understandably so, where are

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.040
you now with that?

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.040
well it's funny right

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.040
because I

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.040
because Jamaican our motto

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.040
is, I don't know if it's for you

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.040
because you're from the West Indian Islands

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.040
Jamaica is out of many one people

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.040
and I like that

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.040
you see really we

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.040
I mean it's hard to find a

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.040
proper white person I would say in it because everything

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.040
is mixed, I remember I was living in London

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.040
and one of my friends said to me, he said listen

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.040
this is the colour of the future man

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.040
this is the colour of the future

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.040
and I said what do you mean? He said listen when is everyone going to be like this?

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.040
this was in the 80s

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.040
and I

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.040
thought come on, come on, it sounds good

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.040
but now I can see it because

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.040
you know I mean

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.040
it's good to mix, I think my father

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.040
I was speaking to

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.040
at the funeral, I was at the funeral and there was this

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.040
one of the white guys who used to go to our church

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.040
and he said you see your father

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.040
was into people mixing

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.040
he understood the importance

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.040
and he said he helped us when we were younger

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.040
these white people he said he helped us start a business

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.040
he said I'll never forget that you know

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.040
I'll be grateful for that because the business is still going

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.040
you know and obviously that would have been in the 70s

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.040
but he said yeah

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.040
he was very equal you know like my mother

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.040
she's Jewish

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.040
so my mother

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.040
was olive skin

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.040
so and my father is about my colour, I'm one of the darkest

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.040
in my family you know which was

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.040
strange because

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.040
in this country I feel like I was

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.040
brainwashed, I went to school

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.040
and you know I never ever went out with

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.040
a black girl until I was

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.040
leaving to move

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.040
to London and I went out with a very very

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.040
light mixed-race girl because I didn't like

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.040
black people you know, didn't like black people

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.040
because I was brainwashed

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.040
it's really strange you know

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.040
to, because when

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.040
there's white girls who only, I'm talking from

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.040
a man's point of view, a black man

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.040
there's white girls who only like black guys

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.040
and I used to, when they used to

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.040
talk to me, I used to find out

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.040
I used to think, you're strange, why don't you like

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.040
your own people, why don't you like white people

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.040
oh and they say all this about this and this, all

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.040
sillyness you know, but I was the same

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.040
without realising you know because

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.040
I was just brainwashed, I was in school

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.040
somehow they taught me that black people

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.040
had big noses, big lips

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.040
and were ugly and looked like monkeys

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.040
you know I just learnt that from school

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.040
somehow and

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.040
it's strange because I don't remember ever

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.040
sitting in a class and them telling

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.040
me that, but I know I learnt it from school

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.040
you know and so I

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.040
was sort of prejudice

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.040
or racist I suppose

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.040
towards my own people

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.040
I guess it would have been hard as well because if you're one in a class

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.040
of 30 you're the only black person

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.040
and you don't really have much options do you

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.040
in terms of liking a black girl

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.040
or whatever, you didn't have that option in school

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.040
besides the fact that it was compounded

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.040
with the racism of we're ugly

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.040
and we're this and we're that and wanting to escape

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.040
it in some way

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.040
I suppose so, I'm really surrounded by it

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.040
well I remember talking to one of my friends

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.040
he's a year younger than me

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.040
but his brother is a couple of years older than me

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.040
and he said, my brother

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.040
the older one, he said

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.040
he put bleach in a bath and jumped in a bath

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.040
and bleached, tried to be white

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.040
you know it was really hard in

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.040
them times

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.040
people don't understand because

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.040
I'm the first generation born here

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.040
my father was from Jamaica

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.040
like the Windrush generation you say

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.040
we were the first born here

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.040
and it's strange

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.040
because you had what you call the Docs

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.040
and them Docs people were mostly

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.040
they were there for quite a long time

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.040
and they were actually born here

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.040
their parents were born here, they were Dockers

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.040
they came here for years, but as

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.040
we come in the Windrush generation

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.040
and when we come

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.040
to Jamaicans, Jamaican people

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.040
they were nice people, but Jamaican

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.040
everyone knows Jamaican don't take rubbish

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.040
so when you're trying to tell a Jamaican

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.040
you're this, you're that, it's not easy for us

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.040
so there would be a lot of problems

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.040
because we don't like being pushed around

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.040
I don't like being pushed around

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.040
it's in my DNA

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.040
I can't be pushed around

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.040
I was a bit different to my brothers

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.040
and the people I went to school with

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.040
because the people I went to school with

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.040
they don't mind being pushed around

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.040
but I couldn't

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.040
it just wouldn't happen with me

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.040
there was something in me which told me

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.040
I'm the same as you, who do you think you are

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.040
and if you can fight me

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.040
I'll respect you, but if you can't fight me

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.040
that's it

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.040
Do you think there was a culture

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.040
you mentioned Butown and the kind of

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.040
the people that came from the 1800s

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.040
and how it was a settled

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.040
community in that sense

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.040
but do you think there was a culture of

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.040
acceptance

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.040
of being ill treated

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.040
or being ostracised

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.040
in Cardiff I suppose

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.040
and that

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.040
didn't sit well with the new migrants

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.040
well this is what I know

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.040
the Docks people when I grew up

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.040
they had their own little army

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.040
they were very close, they all knew each other

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.040
they all seemed to support each other

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.040
but I didn't live there

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.040
but I never used to go down there except when my dad would take me

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.040
in a van when he'd ask people to come to church

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.040
it's funny

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.040
for me when I was a child

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.040
I used to fight a lot, but we had an unwritten

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.040
rule, it was like if you see a black man in trouble

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.040
you help him

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.040
because there wasn't many of us

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.040
like we were saying earlier on

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.040
and that's

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.040
sort of how it was

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.040
but I don't

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.040
it's funny because like I said it seemed like

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.040
my parents

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.040
generation, them ones, and my dad

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.040
was a minister and they seemed to be able

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.040
to go anywhere and be okay with

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.040
other sort of black people and stuff

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.040
but us, the first ones born here

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.040
I found it

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.040
strange

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.040
when I was younger

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.040
it was funny because

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.040
we had light skin

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.040
so when I was younger

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.040
the white people wouldn't really accept you

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.040
just because you're black, any colour black

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.040
and then the black, dark, dark people

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.040
they weren't too cool with you neither

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.040
because you were in between in them days

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.040
in Jamaica they called us red skin

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.040
I mean

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.040
it was just strange

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.040
but then you're told like

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.040
if you've got any colour

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.040
you're black

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.040
so you've got to be a black person

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.040
but some of the blacks are not cool

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.040
it's just really weird, it's just strange

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.040
but anyway, I don't think a black person

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.040
would beat you up

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.040
just because you were light the colour of skin

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.040
a white man would want to string you up

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.040
just because you've got any tiny bit of colour

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.040
and some white people

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.040
they can see black, even when

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.040
you can't see black

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.040
but I know

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.040
it always happens

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.040
so the history with Butown

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.040
you didn't really have a relationship with Butown then?

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.040
not until I was

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.040
like a teenager

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.040
because there was some

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.040
in my school

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.040
but when I was in school I think there might have been

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.040
two black people in the A band

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.040
except for Fitz Allen

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.040
when I went to Fitz Allen

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.040
there was 2000 people

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.040
and just say

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.040
maybe 75

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.040
if that

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.040
were black

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.040
if that

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.040
like Indians or whatever

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.040
and now if you go to Fitz Allen

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.040
the roles reversed

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.040
I mean it's strange

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.040
because obviously I've got children

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.040
even my children

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.040
they tell me they

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.040
have experienced racism and stuff

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.040
I've got children lighter again because my wife was white and stuff

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.040
so I mean it's just

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.040
a system

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.040
I don't really think it'll ever

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.040
change

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.040
because

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.040
I don't think it'll change

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.040
because

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.040
there are people who

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.040
like the white race

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.040
they sort of feel like they're superior than they

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.040
I mean they just do

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.040
even now

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.040
you know they

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.040
I mean

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.040
they still don't

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.040
see black people as on like an even

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.040
path today they just don't

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.040
it's just the system even though we'll get better

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.040
and better

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.040
I won't be surprised if there's Muslim one day

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.040
in this country

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.040
which obviously I'm not really

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.040
into but

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.040
I just think I wish that people could

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.040
just live and support

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.040
each other as equals

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.040
that is

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.040
I hear what you're saying there

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.040
what are the coping mechanisms then

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.040
in a system that seems to

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.040
inherently be against you?

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.040
What are the coping mechanisms for us and for our children?

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.040
Well I stay

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.040
away as much as I can

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.040
from authorities

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.040
you know because I just

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.040
I mean what's the point I mean

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.040
I don't like going places because as soon as I

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.040
think to myself they see a black face and that's it

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.040
and I suppose this is all ingrained

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.040
from years ago you know because

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.040
obviously it's not all bad

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.040
it's not there's such a change

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.040
I mean you've got the

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.040
the black

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.040
is it Emmy what do they call them?

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.040
the member, no the mayor

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.040
the member of the

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.040
AM that's what they are here in Wales

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.040
isn't it? Yeah

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.040
assembly member, yeah you've got him

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.040
I went to him before

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.040
for help he didn't do much for me but I suppose

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.040
it's because he's got white people around

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.040
him you know and no matter what happens

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.040
we're in a bad

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.040
black people

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.040
we're the underdogs no matter what happens

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.040
anyway yeah so that's the coping

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.040
mechanisms you stay away I just stay away as

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.040
much as possible and try and be in the background

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.040
and just not be in anyone's

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.040
face you know

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.040
and you've got to trust God as a Christian

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.040
you know and

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.040
you know because I mean it's funny because

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.040
I mean the Christian circle is

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.040
slightly different

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.040
because slightly

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.040
different nowadays because people realize

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.040
you know that black

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.040
people we Christians we carry something

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.040
like the Jewish people had something

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.040
in their day the black people the African

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.040
race

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.040
they're very spiritual and people know

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.040
that you know so in

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.040
the Christian circles now it seems like

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.040
the black people are sort of taken

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.040
over a bit because we have got

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.040
I mean even in the city church which used to

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.040
be the city temple

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.040
they've got

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.040
I think they've got like a South

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.040
American I think he's got colour

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.040
pastor now and they got like a

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.040
youth pastor Ricardo who was a black

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.040
guy he was the first black guy probably there

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.040
and I think to myself well you know

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.040
yeah cool you know so something's

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.040
happening you know and

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.040
yeah I mean for me I just

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.040
think to myself personally

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.040
you know as a Christian you either

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.040
trust God or what's the point like you know

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.040
you know because really

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.040
I mean I don't know I mean life is strange

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.040
in it I mean you wake up you

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.040
eat at breakfast like you

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.040
asked me about breakfast you

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.040
go to work you know you can

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.040
marry you have children and

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.040
it's just a circle in it life is just a circle

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.040
and you know if

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.040
you're born into maybe a rich family

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.040
you know you might have money but it

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.040
doesn't mean you're going to be happy

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.040
and whether you're rich

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.040
or poor one day you're

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.040
not going to be here no more

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.040
so I just realized like

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.040
you know if I'm not here

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.040
and then when I'm not here my

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.040
spirit is going to live forever I need it

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.040
to be living in the right place

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.040
and I know that's with Jesus you know and

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.040
and that's

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.040
not just because of my culture because I was brought up

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.040
Christian see some people might think

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.040
it's because oh he's brought up Christian

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.040
no it's because

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.040
I met Jesus he spoke to me

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.040
and I become a Christian

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.040
You grew up as a Christian then didn't

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.040
there was a period where you went

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.040
yeah I grew up in a Christian household

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.040
but I wasn't a Christian

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.040
you know I used to always repent

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.040
and give my heart to the Lord because I knew I was

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.040
a wicked person and I knew

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.040
I was a bad person and I wanted to

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.040
be safe from one week to the next

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.040
so every time I knew all the bad things I'd done

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.040
so I'd go to the front

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.040
and I'd say Lord forgive me

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.040
and I hoped that it lasted a week

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.040
I was just really bad you know because

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.040
if you do wrong you've got to pay for that

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.040
in this world or the next I mean if you

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.040
do something wrong

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.040
in this life like if you steal and you get

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.040
caught you're going to get in trouble

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.040
you know if you fight and you get caught you're going to get in trouble

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.040
anything you do

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.040
that's wrong and you get caught

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.040
you can face the consequence

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.040
so this life we live I knew

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.040
I was doing wrong you know and

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.040
so I just said

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.040
I'm sorry and ask for forgiveness

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.040
but then Jesus spoke to me and I was in

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.040
a club and then I became a Christian

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.040
and when I became a Christian I realized

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.040
then this Jesus

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.040
who

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.040
2000 years ago they said died

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.040
died and then raised

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.040
from the dead and spoke to his disciples

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.040
he's the same one who spoke to me

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.040
and he speaks to people and I believe that

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.040
so I know

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.040
like it's not because

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.040
I was brought up as a Christian

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.040
that helped me and I was a foundation and I thank

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.040
God for that

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.040
you know but it's because

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.040
I met Jesus myself I'm a Christian because

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.040
I know Jesus myself

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.040
I'm not a Christian because my parents

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.040
in the Welsh revival when God visited

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.040
Wales in 1904

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.040
there was a saying might have been

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.040
before that but it was a saying which said

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.040
God has no grandchildren

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.040
you got to know God for yourself

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.040
that's what that means I didn't know that but that's what it means

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.040
so I know God I know Jesus for myself

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.040
so I'm not like a Muslim who

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.040
trusts that his grandfather

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.040
great grandad or whatever

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.040
you know was a Muslim

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.040
so he's a Muslim or a Hindu

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.040
who just follows Gods because

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.040
they've been there they make the rain they do

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.040
this they do that no no I don't I'm the

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.040
sort of person where it's got to be

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.040
real you know so

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.040
if you're in front of me and I can see you

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.040
I know you're real but

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.040
don't tell me about your sister

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.040
because I don't

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.040
know if she's real or if you're making her up it's

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.040
got to be real to me I'm that sort of person

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.040
even though people think I'm crazy

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.040
which is okay I don't mind that

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.040
you know because it's okay

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.040
you know because I because this

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.040
crazy person when he dies he's going to be with Jesus

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.040
so I don't care don't bother me

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.040
yeah I think it is challenging being

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.040
spiritual in

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.040
this day and age

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.040
well I think it's I think

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.040
it's actually not so bad now and I tell

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.040
you why because anything goes people

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.040
anything goes except Christianity

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.040
which is really strange you know because

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.040
in the old days when you thought about Jesus

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.040
they appeared in a madhouse

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.040
yeah but they are

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.040
called religious mania I think

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.040
they used to call it

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.040
if you go back in the old days the proper

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.040
born again Christians used to love Jesus

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.040
they used to burn them as witches and things like that

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.040
so people have always done strange

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.040
things but nowadays it's cool

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.040
to an extent to be a Muslim

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.040
it's cool to be a Buddhist I think Buddhists are quite

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.040
cool anyway because they just go round in

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.040
circles and they do good usually

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.040
if I was going to be any religion I'd be a Buddhist

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.040
because Buddhists I don't think hurt people

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.040
even some Hindus

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.040
they just come back and they do good you know

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.040
I mean I'm into that

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.040
but Jesus is real

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.040
which is the difference

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.040
so it doesn't matter what anyone is

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.040
or what they know man

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.040
I want to follow I will only follow

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.040
what's real you know only

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.040
so if I was brought up a Muslim

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.040
or a Hindu or Buddhist

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.040
or whatever I'm the sort of person

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.040
would want to know what's real

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.040
why do I have to follow something

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.040
that's not real I need to have the reality

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.040
give me the real and I'm cool

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.040
if someone says they're going to slap me I wouldn't believe

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.040
until they hit me I'm not the sort of person

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.040
worse than Dalton Thomas I am

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.040
you know

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.040
so I'm thinking okay so your father passed away when you were 13

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.040
yeah

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.040
I'm thinking about a scenario now

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.040
of this man from Jamaica coming over

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.040
and his wife following him

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.040
that's what they used to do apparently

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.040
when the man comes first and the lady

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.040
comes after I think they used to come

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.040
and they used to prepare the way

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.040
to make it easier that's what real men do

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.040
I suppose make sure that the wives are okay

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.040
that's what they used to do

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.040
because everything's changed

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.040
the world's gone upside down

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.040
if my dad

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.040
woke up from the grave

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.040
he wouldn't

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.040
think he was

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.040
he wouldn't think that he was in Wales

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.040
because we found such a change

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.040
everything changes but like wow

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.040
I mean my dad's been dead

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.040
about 30 years

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.040
30 years

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.040
he wouldn't recognise

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.040
this country

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.040
there's such a change

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.040
could be good could be bad

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.040
a lot of good things have happened

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.040
we've got the Millennium Stadium there's a lot of people

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.040
coming to Cardiff now and Cardiff

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.040
is on the map in it

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.040
so that's good

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.040
but it's such a change

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:34.040
what advice would you give to young

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:38.040
well I guess you kind of answered this already

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.040
when I talked about coping mechanisms

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.040
but what advice would you give to young people now

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.040
in terms of

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.040
where to go

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.040
well I would say

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.040
if I had to live my life over again

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.040
first of all

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.040
when I got saved I wished I was a Christian earlier

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.040
that would be my main

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.040
so I would say to a person

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.040
it's good to seek out

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.040
in your life

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.040
where you're going to be in the next life

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.040
what's real to you

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.040
what's your calling why are you here

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.040
and it's important for a person

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.040
to study hard

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.040
be good to people

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.040
get on with people

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.040
because even though everybody goes through struggles

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.040
there are a lot of opportunities now

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.040
which wasn't around in my day

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.040
we're living in an age

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.040
where you can be anything you want

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.040
and in fact the more bizarre you are

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.040
the more people will accept you

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.040
so I would tell a person

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.040
be true to who you are

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.040
be the person God has called you to be

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.040
and always

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.040
search

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.040
for the creator

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.040
I would say Jesus obviously

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.040
but that's the advice I would give somebody I suppose

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.040
your colour doesn't have to be a hindrance anymore

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.040
in a lot of ways

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.040
it can be an advantage

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.040
especially if you're a black person speaking Welsh

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.040
because there's a lot of opportunities

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.040
so yeah just study

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.040
study hard, like my children, I hope they study hard

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.040
and just be faithful to God

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.040
and try not to

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.040
have too many different partners

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.040
just try and wait for the right person

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.040
save yourself, that's what I would say

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:14.040
In terms of these stories and these histories

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.040
so you know that we're connecting the stories

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.040
of the Wendrush generation

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.040
and all these people telling us about

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.040
what it was like back home and what it's been like here

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.040
and how they kind of like

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.040
navigate that sense of belonging

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.040
feeling Jamaican

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.040
feeling British

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.040
how do you make sense of the two and all of that

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.040
how important do you think these stories are

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.040
for the next generation

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.040
and the generation after that, do you think it's relevant?

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.040
I think it's really really relevant

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.040
because the thing is

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.040
I wish now

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.040
that I would have sat down with my dad

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.040
or my dad would have sat down and talked to me

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.040
and talked to me about what it was like

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.040
because my dad's generations

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.040
most of them

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.040
didn't pass on a lot of information

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.040
I think there's a lot of

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.040
illegitimacy

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.040
is that it's by when you have like a lot of people

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.040
I think in

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.040
I'd say the West Indian culture

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.040
and I'd say a lot of people

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.040
got family that they don't know about

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.040
and it's all been kept secret

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.040
and I think because of things like that we don't know a lot

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.040
there's a lot of things

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.040
I believe that we should know that we don't know

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.040
I think there's

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.040
I've got probably loads of

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.040
cousins and stuff

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.040
and family that I don't even know about

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.040
and I wish I did know about because family

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.040
is everything really in this world

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.040
it's about family

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.040
and sometimes we need support from family

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.040
and there's

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.040
they say blood is thicker than water

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.040
some people say yes, some people say no

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.040
but you know it's

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.040
good if you can confide in a family member

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.040
it's easier isn't it

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.040
yeah, so I guess in a way

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.040
knowing these stories

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.040
and knowing this kind of legacy kind of helps to root you

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.040
in a way?

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.040
of course, it's like my mother

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.040
like I said she's Jewish and I said to my mother

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.040
one day I wanted to go to the synagogue

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.040
because when I became a Christian

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.040
I wanted to

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.040
when I was younger I always wanted to hook up with my Jamaican roots

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.040
I wish I was born in Jamaica, I hated being born

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.040
in this country, I hated this country

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.040
you know, I was angry with my parents

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.040
why was I born here, why was I born here

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.040
and when I became a Christian I realised

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.040
oh ok, because God wants me here

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.040
to help people and I like that

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.040
but um

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.040
talk about rooting

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.040
yeah, yeah, rooting

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.040
so I was saying

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.040
yeah, so I always wanted to be Jamaican

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.040
when I was younger

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.040
because I didn't know my mother was

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:40.040
Jewish anyway and even if I did know

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.040
I wouldn't have acknowledged it

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.040
when I was younger because I liked the Jamaican

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.040
I liked the way they talk, I just like how they are

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.040
they're cool, you know

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.040
their music, the reggae, I love all that sort of stuff

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.040
but

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.040
then

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.040
anyway, that's it

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.040
it's very important, like my kids

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.040
I say look I'm Jewish by birth but I'm a Jamaican

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.040
you know, it's easier

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.040
it was easier for me to see myself as a Jamaican

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.040
because like I said in this country

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.040
because you're so ostracised, you feel like

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.040
other place and you

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.040
I used to hold on to something, I used to hold on to my

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.040
my Jamaican-ness

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.040
even though I never went to Jamaica until I was older

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.040
but you know

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.040
and it's funny, right?

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.040
you should say that, because the first time

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.040
I ever heard reggae music

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.040
not Bob Marley, I mean

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.040
reggae music, right?

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.040
I felt like I had a hole

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.040
and it was filled, it was really weird

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.040
people say they have that when they

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.040
get saved, when they become Christians

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.040
but it happened to me, I just felt

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.040
that there was a hole, I didn't even know

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.040
I just felt like this was filled

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:46.040
when I heard reggae music

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.040
and it was really strange for me

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.040
you know

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.040
and I just fell in love with reggae music then

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.040
in like the 80s

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.040
you know, when you have like

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.040
Eka Mouse, or Yellow Man

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.040
or

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.040
people stitching

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.040
all them

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.040
it was really strange

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.040
yeah, that's really touching

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.040
okay, I think we're pretty much done

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.040
is there anything else you want to say, or add?

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.040
no, I just thank you, you know

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.040
for taking your time out, you know

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.040
your organisation and

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.040
speaking to people, because it is important

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.040
I wish, like I was saying, I wish that I would have

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.040
my parents would have, my dad really would have

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.040
took me to Jamaica

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.040
when I was a child and explained things to me

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.040
and showed me around, I would have loved all that

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.040
just to have that, so I just

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.040
I mean, this is for my children

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.040
and maybe people who are interested, and at least

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.040
I think they know, I thank God for that

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.040
okay
