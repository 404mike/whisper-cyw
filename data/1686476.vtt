00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640
Firstly, let us say thank you to Heritage Lottery Wales for funding this short project

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:17.780
which is intended to share memories about Butetown, Cardiff Bay and the docks from people

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.060
who were there, knew about it and were a part of it.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.980
Now this episode is split into two, this is the first of the two episodes, but this episode

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:40.460
is with Beryl Makers, me Freeman, who comes from a very, very famous sporting family.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.460
And Beryl is in every sense a personality.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.460
Childhood, yours?

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.780
Oh yes, but as I said, you don't know where that is, you Victoria Park in Cardiff, I'll

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.580
say Campton, we were all born in Campton, because my grandmother lives there.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.780
And then when my grandmother passed, my father said, oh my dad had moved down the dock.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.460
So we came down here, I think I was three when we moved down.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.100
And we lived in the same house all those years until they pulled it down, they pulled the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.100
houses down.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.140
But oh, I'm sorry to leave Sophia Street, you know, everybody, I mean, all that, well

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.140
a lot of them here now, but I mean, a lot of the neighbors, I mean, they all row, both

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.540
sides, different nationalities, you know, next door to us, in fact it was Adam, on the

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.980
other side it was Norwegian, then you move up and the girl I went to school with across

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.980
from me, Selma, her father was Norwegian, you know, so we were all, you know, different

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.340
nationalities and we all got on great.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.140
So where were your parents from?

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.540
Oh, my mother was from here.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.340
So my father came from the West Indies when he was 17.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.340
But my mother, my mother was born in the bay.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.540
And then when my grandfather died, no, before my grandfather died, because he was with someone

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.340
else, we moved to Campton with my nana.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.340
And then we stayed there.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.340
And of course, I was three, four when I moved down here.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.340
Yeah.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.340
So, but my father, he was from 17, he was 17.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.340
He was a merchant seaman, was he?

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.340
Yes, yes.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.340
He was a cook.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.340
He was a cook.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.340
And my mother was auntie to Joey Erskine, the boxer.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.340
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.340
Yeah.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.340
Because Johnny Erskine and my mother were brother and sister.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.340
And then my father, my mother was brother and sister.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.340
And then when my brother got older, they picked him for rugby and then he played for Halifax

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.340
up in Yorkshire.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.340
Right.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.340
Yeah.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.340
Billy Boston, you know Billy Boston?

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.340
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.340
Yeah, Billy Boston played for Wigan, Johnny played for Halifax and a couple of other boys.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.340
Was that Johnny Freeman, was it?

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.340
Yeah.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.340
Yeah, right, yeah, yeah.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.340
That was my brother.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.340
Yeah.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.340
And Billy Boston was his mate.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.340
But he went to Wigan and Johnny went to Halifax.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.340
I mean, from your, I mean, I guess it must be your great grandmother's time.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.340
She had a hell of a lot of sports people in her, in her children and descendants, didn't she?

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.340
Gosh.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.340
I mean, you know.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.340
Yeah, that was like, yeah, my mother's mother.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.340
Yeah, because there's a picture and I say, oh, I'll show you.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.340
She said, when he was about 18 and she said, oh, I'll bring it up on my mobile phone.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.340
She said, when I see you again, I'll show you.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.340
There was a picture of Johnny, Billy and Joey and they were all together.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.340
Yeah.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.340
And Joey was the best man in my brother's wedding.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.340
Yeah.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:22.340
I mean, I had a conversation recently just out the blue with Joe's son, Joe Erskine Jr.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.340
Oh, I don't know what he...

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.340
He's up in Derby, lives up in Derby.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.340
Oh, I see.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.340
And he didn't know.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.340
And it's funny, people don't know, because they move away, they don't know the details of their own history.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.340
And he knew his family were black, but he didn't know where from.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.340
And he didn't know, was it Eustace Erskine? Was that it?

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.340
He was from...

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.340
My grandfather?

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.340
Yeah.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.340
My grandfather?

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.340
Yeah.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.340
Uriah?

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.340
Uriah Erskine.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.340
He didn't know Uriah was from Jamaica.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.340
Oh, wow.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.340
He didn't know.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.340
Oh, wow.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.340
And it's funny...

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.340
He didn't know he had black in him.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.340
He did, but he didn't know where it was from.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.340
Oh, right.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.340
Yeah.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.340
Yeah, Uriah.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.340
See, my grandmother was married to him.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.340
Yeah.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.340
And then she had three daughters.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.340
And then he went with Joe Erskine's grandmother.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.340
Right.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.340
And he lived with her.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.340
Right.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.340
And they had a boarding house in Moriah Street.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.340
And then, of course, my grandmother...

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.340
My grandmother was from Chelmsford in Essex.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.340
Right.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.340
My grandmother was.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.340
And then when her father went to hide, she moved to London.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.340
Because she was living in Chelmsford, I think.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.340
She moved to London, and she had a house there.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.340
And then the woman next door said...

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.340
Because she had a boarding house, and she said...

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.340
Oh, she had moved to the side of the house that...

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.340
You know, my grandfather just came from the West Indies.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.340
Right.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.340
And he had...

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.340
Oh, she said, oh, no.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.340
You know, she said, oh, go on.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.340
It's only for a couple of nights.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.340
And...

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.340
Yeah, well...

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.340
Going up to show in the room...

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.340
She went down on her knees on the stairs.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.340
And she said to the woman next door,

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.340
someone's going to get married.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.340
Yeah, my grandmother married him, yeah.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.340
Yeah.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.340
And then they moved to Kersley.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.340
And then, of course, he had the...

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.340
Like, my mother, my auntie Louie, my auntie Lillie.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.340
He had, and then...

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.340
He had a couple...

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.340
And then they called him...

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.340
And they called him Joey's grandmother.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.340
And then my uncle Johnny.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.340
And you can see, being the auntie from Mothers,

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.340
my uncle Johnny, that's Joey's father,

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.340
him and my mother was, oh, God, very close.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.340
Very, very close, you know.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.340
And then he...

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.340
The first time my mother met him,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.340
when he moved to Kansas,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.340
and his mother sent him up to my mother's wedding.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.340
Yeah, he was 14.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.340
And that's the first time my mother got in with him.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.340
Yeah.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.340
It's...

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.340
And then, of course, I said, when we came down here,

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.340
and then my uncle Johnny, that's Joey's father,

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.340
him and my mother, oh, my God, they were close.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.340
Yeah.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.340
So, what else do you want to know?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.340
Whatever.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.340
Whatever we...

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.340
We got one love?

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.340
We got it made.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.340
I'm a listener and you're a talker.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.340
They're perfect.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.340
Yeah, but I mean...

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.340
OK, tell me about school.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.340
What was school like?

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.340
Oh, school was great.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.340
But I didn't like school.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.340
Which one did you go to?

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.340
South Church Street.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.340
Right, yeah.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.340
Yeah.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.340
And...

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.340
Eleanor, that's all, yeah.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.340
Billy Boston's sister was assisted by one of the others.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.340
Yeah.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.340
She said, this one, she always tells people,

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.340
this one was always the same.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.340
She couldn't have cared less.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.340
Oh, I hate to do this.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.340
She said, and Eleanor used to be really, you know,

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.340
studying about things.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.340
And I'd be on and be laughing and this and the other.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.340
And they always used to call me out, the teachers.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.340
I couldn't have cared less, honestly.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.340
I couldn't have cared less.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.340
My sister, Joanie, and Johnny, my brothers,

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.340
they were very into it, you know.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.340
Yeah.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.340
Into school.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.340
And now Joanie, she passed a scholarship

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.340
and went to Heathrow's House.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.340
And she, you know, had a nice job down the Dockson office.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.340
And, you know, she loved things.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.340
And then, of course, I just wanted to go to work.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.340
Yeah.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.340
Get over school and go to work.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.340
Get some money in your pocket.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.340
We came out when we were 13 and those things, you know.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.340
Yeah.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.340
And, oh, I wanted to go to work.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.340
Yeah.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.340
So, let me tell you what, let me take you back on school,

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.340
school age a bit.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:41.340
What about the, did you go on the wits and treats?

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.340
Oh, gosh, yes.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.340
It was wonderful.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.340
This entire thing in the lorry.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.340
Yeah.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.340
We had a rope all around us.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.340
This entire thing in the back of the lorry.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.340
Yeah.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.340
Yeah, it was wonderful.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.340
Oh, God.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:07.340
And then me and my sister, my older sister,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.340
when everything was having something,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.340
we'd go to that church.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.340
So, we could go with them.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.340
I mean, one of the boys, I can't remember,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.340
one of the boys I interviewed, he said,

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.340
all of the Arab boys, the Muslim boys,

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.340
used to go to the church for two weeks before the trip.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.340
So, they could get on it.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.340
Yeah.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.340
I was created on class.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.340
We would have me in our school, all the schools anyway,

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:46.340
you know, we had all, I mean, we, I was saying to Eleanor

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.340
at the end of the day, I said,

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.340
Carmen, we come out of school, and it's so nice,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.340
it's blonde and it's white.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.340
And then there's my other friend, Barbara MacFer,

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.340
who's out of school, and it was Eleanor,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.340
and we'd all have our answers on when they're coming out of school,

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.340
you know what I mean?

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.340
Yeah, I do. I do.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.340
It was, oh, God, it was great.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.340
We did not know anything about white, it is, and all of that.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.340
We did not know anything about it until we grew, you know.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.340
Yeah.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:21.340
But we all had to, I mean, tell them the least,

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.340
Joni Carp is, it was white as snow, you know what I mean?

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.340
Yeah.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.340
And we'd all have our answers all around when they're coming out,

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.340
and we'd all play together, and they'd come in the house,

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.340
and answer me, can we get in our house?

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.340
You know what I mean?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.340
Everybody used to eat at everybody's houses.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.340
I think the mums must have cooked for school half the time.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.340
Yeah, because I know my friend through the lab,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.340
I was straight, she used to say, oh, watch them, they're cooking.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:57.340
Remember, they always made apple tarts and all the pastries,

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.340
they were best over.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.340
She'd made little jam tarts and that.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.340
So, roll it in.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.340
She came in this day, and she did not remember the gesture of the oven.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.340
You know what jam's like, boiling.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.340
She pinched the jam.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.340
And she started screaming,

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.340
Mum said, see that, you get to be nicking.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.340
All you have to ask is if you have one.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.340
Remember, there was always baking.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.340
My father was a cook at sea.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.340
I mean, I was the baby of my family,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:36.340
and I'm the one who got to get their fingers around the inside of the pot.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:44.340
You fight to be the one where the pot was almost empty.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.340
Great mix, Pegs.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:53.340
And you used to have the old solid metal griddle thing.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.340
I'm 72.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.340
Oh, yeah.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:03.340
But you know what I mean, that big slab of metal and the Welsh cakes went on it.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.340
Oh, the smell.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.340
My mother's is round.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:14.340
Yeah, but it must have been, one of the things that somebody said to me the other day was just

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:19.340
walking along some of the streets, you know, Sapphire and Millicent,

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:25.340
you could walk along them, and the smell that was coming out the aisles of the cooking,

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.340
from all the way round the world.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.340
And where were you from?

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.340
All my family are Barry.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.340
Oh, yeah.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.340
We're a Barry family.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.340
Hinds, Paynes.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.340
Darwin Hines was my uncle.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.340
Gwen was my auntie.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.340
Oh, sorry, Gwen.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:53.340
When you had them, the club in Barry, we used to go down there.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:00.340
But that's the thing, Barry and Cardiff, people went back and forth.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:06.340
Yeah, well, before my friend moved out, she lived in Caddickston.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.340
I used to go down there a lot.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.340
Yeah.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:15.340
Yeah, I mean, that club in Barry, we used to go down there.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.340
So, okay, what was your first job then?

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.340
Let me see, oh, the brushworks.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.340
Right.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.340
It was good.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.340
And it was good in old days.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.340
Yeah.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.340
The brushworks, oh, I had so many jobs.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:39.340
I worked in the brushworks, I worked in the cigar factory, the old cigar factory in Greenstown.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.340
Yeah, was that Freeman's?

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.340
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.340
My mum worked there for a while when she came back to Wales.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:53.340
When I worked in the old one in Greenstown, oh, God, it was great.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:15:05.340
But then when I went to the one in Canaas Road, oh my God, it was like being in a, like, in a concentration camp.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.340
Oh, no, no, I didn't like it.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.340
Right.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.340
I couldn't stay there long.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.340
Oh, I had all kinds of jobs.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:20.340
But then when I went to, I was in a show.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.340
Hmm.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:33.340
And yeah, because I went, my mother said to us when we were little to Miss Marjory's dancing class in Greenstown.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.340
Right.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.340
Used to go.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.340
And yeah, it was good.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.340
And then I went in a show.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.340
Where was that?

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.340
Down in London?

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.340
Oh, yeah, we used to do London every three weeks.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.340
Yeah, we'd go like, oh, I went all over the country.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.340
I was 16, going on 17.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.340
My mother didn't want me to go.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.340
I told her, you're sent off to dancing school.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:02.340
You know, I, you know, I wanted to go.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.340
I mean, what was that show called?

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.340
Something Goes to Harlem?

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.340
Was that it?

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.340
Harlem Comes to Town.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.340
Ah, that's the one.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.340
No, that was the Netherlands.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.340
Yeah, but it was Girls from the Bay went down with that as well, didn't it?

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.340
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:22.340
But I'm trying to think what house it was called.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:30.340
I know that my sister was in Harlem Comes to Town or something in that.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.340
I forget what.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.340
Yeah.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.340
I was 16, 17.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.340
But it was okay, the experience, you know.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:47.340
Because every third week we played like Shackled Bush and Kilburn and all those places.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.340
Yeah, it was okay.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.340
You got about a bit then?

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.340
Oh, yeah, I met my uncle who was American.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.340
I didn't want to say.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.340
Ah, when was that then?

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.340
Oh, I was, let me see.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.340
I got married when I was 20.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.340
I'm 88 now.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.340
Right.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.340
So I was 20.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.340
And I got married.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:21.340
And then my uncle went back to the States and she keep on saying, when are you coming?

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.340
When are you coming?

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.340
I don't get me.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.340
So I stayed there a while.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.340
Yeah.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:33.340
And then Massachusetts, we lived.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:43.340
And then I, oh, we managed a couple of years before I got pregnant with my son.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.340
And I said, oh, no, I'm not having him here.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.340
I'm going home.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.340
I went home.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.340
I went home and I'm clean.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.340
And then I said, right.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.340
Oh, when you coming back?

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.340
When you coming back?

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.340
I'm coming soon.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.340
He had a dental fly in those days.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.340
Actually, I had a fly in.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:13.340
And he used to say, I'm going to ship and you can't even swim.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.340
So I went back with Craig.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:22.340
He was about five months old, I should think.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.340
And then I stayed for a while and then my youngest sister was getting married.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:32.340
And I said, oh, I want to go home for the wedding.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.340
So he said, you're always back and forth.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.340
He said, OK.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.340
He said, you're not going to stay long.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.340
I said, oh, no.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:49.340
I came back for my sister's wedding and never went back.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.340
But my sister was my roommate.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.340
I was there every year in the States.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:06.340
I used to work the year into what I am being lately because all this lockdown and the

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.340
hangover of the country.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.340
Me and Janice, that's my niece.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.340
We were there.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.340
Let me see.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.340
The one last year was the year before.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.340
Right.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:30.340
Yeah, because I got nieces and nephews in California and in Illinois and that.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.340
My sisters, children.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:37.340
So what happened to your husband then?

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.340
You just dumped him.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.340
Is he what?

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.340
You just dumped him.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:51.340
No, I never went back.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.340
In the late years, I was there all the time.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:20:01.340
And the family, even though I never went back, it's family was all they were terrific.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.340
Every year they sent great clothes and different things.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.340
They were a great family.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.340
But.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:17.340
The trouble is you love the bay, you love Cardiff.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.340
That's it.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.340
Yeah, it took me all that time to go.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:32.340
And then I went and then oh God, I was so old sick.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.340
Oh God, I was old sick.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:41.340
And then I said to him, oh no, I'm not having a baby yet.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.340
I'm going home.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.340
Yeah, so I went.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.340
I come home and he said, oh, when you coming back, when you coming back?

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:58.340
And I took him back and then I said, my sister's getting married and I'm going to the wedding.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.340
And I went back.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.340
And then, but then.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.340
My sister was there.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.340
And then I used to go where we are.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.340
Yeah.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.340
I mean, the point is, it's true.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:21.340
Everybody I've spoken to who's from the bay and who's from Cardiff, they just miss it.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.340
Even though it's different, they just miss it.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.340
It is.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:33.340
I might never have any trouble with people in America.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.340
You know, I mean, I've had more than one thing said to me.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.340
Yeah.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.340
You know what I mean?

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.340
Yeah.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.340
And in the States, maybe because my accent.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.340
Well.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.340
You know, it's like, oh, where you from?

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:55.340
But also, also maybe, Beryl, because you've been brought up in a different place.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:03.340
Not prepared to take some of the nonsense that the Americans have had all their life.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.340
You know what I mean?

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.340
Yes, yes.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.340
But see, I didn't live in the South.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.340
No.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.340
I lived up in North Massachusetts, you know, one side of Boston.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.340
Yeah.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:19.340
And there was nothing like that.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.340
But they did.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.340
They didn't show, you know.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.340
Yeah.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:28.340
Well, they were more likely afraid of you.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:39.340
I mean, my uncle went to, he said, oh, Beryl, you're going home with you.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.340
This was before I had came.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.340
Yeah.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:47.340
Because he had to go to, he had isolated tour where you couldn't, because he's in the

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.340
airport, where you couldn't take your wife.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.340
Oh, right.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.340
And in Greenland they were.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.340
In Greenland.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.340
Oh, wow.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.340
And he said, oh, you're not going home with you.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.340
Because he knew if I went home, I would be.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.340
I'll do for my friend.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:06.340
And my friend, we went to school with, she lived in Arizona.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.340
Yeah.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.340
And she said, oh, come down here, babe.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.340
She said, you know, so my mother-in-law, my family, you know, they all, they were lovely

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.340
people.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.340
And they said, oh, are you going to go?

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.340
I said, oh, no, for a couple of months.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:29.340
I was on there for a year until he came back from Greenland.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.340
Yeah, so I got back just before he came back from Greenland.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.340
Because it was an isolated tour, you know, you couldn't take your wife.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.340
So he said, oh, Beryl, not going home with you.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.340
He said, oh, I won't come back.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.340
And I said, no, I'm going to Fyles in Arizona.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.340
And that's where I went.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.340
Oh, it was wonderful.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.340
That was lovely.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.340
So you've seen a bit of America then, kid?

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.340
Oh, yeah.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.340
California.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.340
My sister lived there.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.340
My other sister lived in Illinois.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.340
And yeah, I love that.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.340
That's what I think.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.340
It wasn't large, do you know what I said?

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.340
That's my niece.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.340
Said, oh, that's a good job.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.340
We didn't go.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.340
We might not be able to get back home.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.340
Yeah.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:20.340
So where in California is your family then, kid?

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.340
No, my sister lived in Sacramento.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.340
Yes, I was from Sacramento.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.340
But my friend lived in Arizona.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.340
And I was down there for nearly a year.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.340
And we were best friends there.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.340
And then she moved up.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:42.340
And then, since before she passed, I went to see her.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.340
To go to my sister's journey in Illinois.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.340
She said, well, why don't you come to me for the week before your journey?

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.340
I said, OK.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.340
So that's what I am.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.340
That's what I've done.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:01.340
OK, you sound like the right kind of person to ask this question of.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:11.340
What was the nightlife like when you were around Cardiff?

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.340
What was the nightlife like?

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.340
Well, we didn't have clubs.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.340
Well, we had this club, the Colonial Centre.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.340
That's where Darwin was.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.340
The Colonial Centre.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.340
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.340
Yeah, very nice.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.340
You used to have dances in there.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.340
And that.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:35.340
But then later years, these clubs were not open down here to me.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.340
When we were teenagers, we used to go to the Colonial Centre.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.340
Yeah.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:47.340
And then people would have a party and this, that, the other.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.340
But don't you know?

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.340
Oh, God, you don't see.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.340
It's on many of the slides.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.340
Oh, yeah.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.340
Yeah.
