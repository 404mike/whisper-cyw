00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
I didn't know until I read Yasmin's, I mean I knew some things. I knew that Lily Shepherd,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.080
for example, had been involved in suffragette and she'd written stuff. She was both a Welsh nat,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.680
Zionist, socialist and I knew she'd heard Rosa Luxemburg speak in Swansea. But read what I hadn't

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.920
known and I knew that Joe, who was one of the sons and who was a doctor in London, in fact was our

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.680
family doctor at one point, he'd been a conscientious objector in the first world war and had gone to

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.360
prison. Lily wrote a novel about, I thought it was great shame nobody did anything during this period,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.400
about the sort of conscientious objectors in Cardiff. But there were two other brothers,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.920
Solomon and I think Isaac, who also went to prison as conscientious objectors. And there's a quote,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.360
she's found Yasmin Donahey, you know, there's, I can't remember what, something like the Mercer,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.520
anyway it's a left-wing, a sort of socialist newspaper and it's, you know, sort of please

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.160
write to the Comrade Shepherd in prison to keep their spirits up or something, you know.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.360
So they were clearly, I mean that's quite unusual. So on the one hand, you know, we were always told

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.800
it was quite a strict household, but, or observant household, but the politics, I suppose if you're a

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.800
binical scholar, you debate, whatever.
