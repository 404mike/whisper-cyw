00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
So, what should we talk about now? Because you were involved with the Burial Society.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:13.000
Yes, my parents traditionally were, well, found members of it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yeah.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Going back many years ago and I think I just followed in their footsteps.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Okay. The burials in Swansea were not just Swansea?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.000
No, they were from Nethley, Port Talbot, Neath, the valleys, West Brailums.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Swansea Cemetery was the only cemetery in this area.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Yeah. So the members of your synagogue, as a member, they would have certain rights regarding burial?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Yes. Included in the, and there used to be a collector who would collect, go around the houses collecting,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
you know, whether it was six months a week or whatever.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That would include, I'd say, burial rights, the plot, in actual fact, the plot.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Okay. And then was there some kind of financial arrangement with Nethley, any other places as well then, or was it done on an individual basis?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I can't really say I wasn't that involved in that side of the municipal, the city.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Do you still get people who were ex-Nethley or Port Talbot wanting to come and be buried in Swansea now?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Unfortunately, no.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
About two weeks ago, didn't you?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Yes, but that wasn't Nethley.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Well, he was not far from Nethley.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Yeah, Tumble, Upper Tumble.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
These are people that are not known to you that suddenly their family says...

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Yes, there's no one left in Nethley now.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Yeah.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The last one died. When did Charlie die?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Oh, it's got to be ten years, if not...

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Yes.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Okay, yeah.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
All my family had left Nethley.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Right.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But you do get people that are Jewish living in the valleys. They don't really want to be associated with the synagogues.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Yeah.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But when they die, they want to have a Jewish funeral.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We oblige as long as they can prove, or the family can prove, that they are in fact Jewish.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Because it took a while for us to realize that the Jewish funeral is a lot cheaper than the Christian, even non-denominational.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Right.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Yeah.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I think they make inquiries probably through Cardiff, and then they find out this one in Swansea. Ours is a lot cheaper.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
That must be quite a delicate matter to deal with.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Yes, very.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Because you have responsibilities, but at the same time, you have to look at it. You need income and everything else as well, don't you?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Yes. Well, you know, we have to keep the cemeteries in good order.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I must admit, if you can say, it's a pleasure to look at. Maybe it would be the wrong wording, but the new cemetery really is very, very beautiful.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So there are two cemeteries in?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Two cemeteries.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Both within your species of the same synagogue?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Yes. One going back to 1700-odd, and the other one, I think, that was... And that opened up by the time we were married.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Yes. No. It lasted a long time after we got married.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So it would have been in the 60s?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
No, I would say later than that.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
For 70s?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Yes, in fact, 70s, because your father is buried in the old cemetery.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
That's true.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I would even say it might have been the early 80s. My mother's buried up there, but she's not in the front row by any means. She's about three or four rows back, isn't she?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And she died in 1981. So I'd say in the 70s it opened.
