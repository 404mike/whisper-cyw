00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.960
I will discover new animals because animals are beautiful creatures, but they're dying,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.240
dying out.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.880
Which is really unfair.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.040
Sometimes I will be a loner.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.480
Like the fire of the salamander raging across the forest.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.120
Sometimes I will be with friends.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.000
Like the border collie swimming in the deep, gentle river.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.320
I won't be rich and I won't be poor.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.520
Not quite middle class though.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.760
In a nice little, quite big cottage.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.560
With gardens that reach as far as the elephant chain searching for water.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:23.560
I will live in a world where everyone will just wise up.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.880
Stop the bomb.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.240
Stop the racism.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.520
Harmonise in peace.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.520
And be mine.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:18.560
I will live in a world where everyone will just wise up.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:34.560
I will live in a world where everyone will just wise up.
