00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For dinner, we had turkey blazing pudding, and after dinner, the young toads sat in front

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of the fire, loosened all buttons, put their large moist hands over their watch chains,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
rolled a little, and slept. Mothers, aunts and sisters scuttled to and fro bearing kill reins.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Auntie Bessie, who had already been frightened twice by a fox-whore mouse, whimpered at the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
sight of the poet and had some heavenly wine, that dog was sick.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Auntie Dossine had to have three aspirins, but Auntie Hannah, who liked the poet, stood

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in the middle of the snow-bombed backyard, singing like a big version of Thrush.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I would blow up all balloons to see how big they would blow up to, and when they burst

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
with the odd head, the uncles jumped and rumbled. In the rich and heavy afternoon, the uncles

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
breathing like dolphins and slowly descending, I would sit among the festoons with the Chinese

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
uncles and live in peace and try to make a modern man of war follow the instructions

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
of the little engineers and produce what might be mistaken for a sea-going tram car.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And then at tea, the recovered uncles would be jolly, and the ice cake bloomed in the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:06.580
center of the table like a marble
