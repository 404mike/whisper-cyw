00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Did the other boys at Brecon know that you were Jewish?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.600
Oh yes. We had a special dispensation that we didn't have to go into chapel.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.240
And I thought, well, I'll be able to get my letters written on a Sunday morning.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.920
Instead of wasting time in chapel, I'll stay in the classroom and write my letters, which was fine.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.520
And of course, when it came to the religious instructions,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.280
I was allowed to sit at the back and get on with other homework.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.560
They didn't force me to take part at all.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.440
I was the only one who didn't attend chapel, which was rather remarkable,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.760
but nobody held it against me. And I was never singled out as being different.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.520
How did that feel being the only one?

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.640
Fine, yes, I was quite happy with it. I didn't worry me.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.880
And I even went on to become head boy of the house, so it certainly didn't inhibit me in any way.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.920
And of course, the name was a bit of a giveaway, wasn't it?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.480
Sherman was not exactly a Welsh name, so they knew that I was different.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.040
And we did have three or four other boys there who were all refugees.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.360
So I wasn't exactly alone. One was a cousin of mine, Tom Adler.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.640
He had the button factory in Merthyr, which, and then there was another chap, Henry Kurtzman.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.960
They had OP chocolates. And there was another one, Bobby Gregory.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.760
And they had a glove factory, Planet Gloves.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.520
Although Tom and Henry had left by the time I came there,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.520
I was contemporary with Bobby Gregory, and he was one of my best friends.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.320
Did you have any dispensations at all when you were at Macefield House or Lamonia School?

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.960
No, no. Well, yeah, there was no religion at all, really, there.
