00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.560
Well, I'd done most of my work in the late 60s, early 80s.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.720
I went a bit quiet because my second marriage in the 80s and my second child.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.480
There's a lot more clubs.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.640
The colleges as well, which was great because they all used to put on bands.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640
The old art college used to put on bands.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.360
I'd done one at the actual art college itself, just over the bridge by the castle.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.840
But we had a lot of church halls that was going.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:47.560
I started off the Bosco church hall where the pieces of mine recorded their album.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.600
And I used to use St. Willis church hall.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.800
The only thing was that these places didn't have bars in them.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.840
We got around that with people bringing their own and even, I even won two bottles on hand.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.840
But otherwise, I'd just tried different venues like the Dolmen Theatre.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.840
They'd only had one band that played previously.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.840
That was Steeleyes Band, who were basically a folk band but they turned electric.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.840
Like Bob Dylan.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:31.880
But when I, Kevin Hayes and the whole world played there, they insisted I had their dorm in

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.880
and I'd pay for their dorm in.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.880
But apparently it was too low for them.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.880
Even though they turned out their year in age, they'd left their post and people got into the venue free.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.880
Which was a shame.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.880
But I did try quite a few venues because there was quite a lot of them.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.920
The Alex was one of the best but I caught the ass end of it.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:03.920
It belonged, I was owned by someone from Cardiff at the time and I wasn't aware that they were closing down.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.920
So I only managed to put on half a dozen gigs there before they closed down and I had to move on again.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.960
Or it would be the venue would moan about it, the committee would say it was too loud, this, that and the other.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.960
Or I'd have to move on.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.960
One time I approached the British Social Club, which is probably the biggest venue left in Newport now.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.960
And at the time I was going to put on Gary Glitter.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.960
I got it all arranged, booked, contract signed.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Everything OK with the committee.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I was let down at the last minute by the committee.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
For what reason exactly I can't remember, a long time ago.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So I had to try and rearrange it and the only venue I could get was the Roundabout.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But not for the same date.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And the date that I could get it for, Mr. Glitter wasn't available.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.040
Well I'm glad to see it wasn't now actually.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.040
But there you go, that's by the by.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.040
And I still wanted to put on a Glitter band.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.040
So I got the, Gary was number one in the Glitters, but the number two was the Suite.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.040
And I had the Suite and I'm glad I did put on the Suite.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040
They were absolutely fabulous.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.040
They didn't have much of a set to play because they were into their first or second single at the time.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.080
So they'd done a lot of Hoo covers.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.080
And they'd done them better than the Hoo.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.080
I mean another band I had at St. Louis Church was a band called Egg.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.080
Three piece band, they were great.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.080
They turned up very early.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.080
So we all went next door into the park, next door and played football.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.080
Until the gig started.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.080
You just make the most of it.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.080
It's just like going to a factory or somewhere else to them.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.080
It's just turning up for work isn't it?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.120
And you just try to make the most of it.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.120
And we had a game of football that night, that day.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.120
When I had caronets in the whole world at the Dolmen Theatre,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.120
the electrics went down about 15 minutes into the gig.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.120
And there was a lot of mess about.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.120
Couldn't find the electrics or sort them out, whatever.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.120
So the saxophonist stepped forward, Lord Coxell,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.120
and entertained the crowd with the sax.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160
And he was absolutely fabulous.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
The crowd loved him.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160
They would have been happy if just Lord Coxell had turned up.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.160
And he told me he used to busk in London at the time

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
and he could earn £100 a day.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
And that was 1970?

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.160
But that was one incident where we had a support act

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
where we didn't have a support act.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
If you know what I mean.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.200
One of the main venues for pun on bands at the time

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.200
was the Kensington Court Club,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200
over in Kensington Place,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.200
just to the other side of the George Street Bridge,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.200
just off Chapsville Road.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.200
Are you aware of that venue?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.200
Yeah, we've heard about it a lot.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.200
Yeah, right, that's where I seen Screaming Lord Such

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.200
and Hackensack and a lot of other bands.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.200
I used to live just there.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.240
I used to live just across the road from it.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.240
But I couldn't get to the venue too often

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.240
because I was busy myself.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.240
But I've seen Focus play there.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.240
Well, it's like a big old mansion there,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.240
a house-type building type thing.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.240
And it had 10 stairs where they used to have the main bands

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.240
and it had upstairs where you had a disco,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.240
which was more or less for the discoites.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.280
And whatever, but it wasn't a big venue.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.280
I mean, one band turned away from there when they turned up

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.280
because they said the stage was too small

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.280
and the roof was too low.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.280
On a Thursday night,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.280
they used to have all the up-and-coming bands

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.280
like, excuse me, Brian Ferry's first band,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.280
Roxy Music and things.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:19.280
And it was the most influential rock place at the time.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.320
And also I think something had to do with it

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.320
from the Kensington Chord Club,

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.320
the Bull Mo Lido just outside Cleon.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.320
They used to have bands playing out there

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.320
like Good Abbott and the Racing Cars

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.320
and Albert, the band I mentioned,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.320
and things like that.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.320
That was a good venue for a while

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.320
before it closed down again.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.320
I don't know why they all closed down

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.320
because they was well frequented back in the day.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.360
There's not so much life in Newport now,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.360
so back in the day, it was always pretty busy.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.360
There wasn't much trouble at all,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.360
although Newport has got a bad reputation for trouble.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:07.360
I could count the fights I'd seen in the last 50 years

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.360
on my one hand.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.360
The Newport Athletic Club,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.360
I've seen one or two fights.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.360
The Baptist Club,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.360
where I've seen the A-man corner

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.360
playing out there one night.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.400
They had a Newport member with them,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.400
the A-man corner.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.400
The sax player was Alan Jones.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.400
He also had another band after A-man corner.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.400
He also had a boutique in Newport called Clobber

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.400
and a boutique in Carriff.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.400
Garage Paradise or something.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.400
It's still about now,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.440
promoting.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.440
Most bands, it was OK,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.440
but one or two had riders.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.440
The biggest rider I ever had was for Nine Below Zero,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.440
where I had them play at the storey.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.440
I was the DJ at the storey,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.440
but I only ever promoted one band at the storey

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.440
and that was Nine Below Zero.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.440
They had one of the biggest riders

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.440
and it cost me half a lot of money

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.440
because there was vegans in the band,

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.440
there was eating,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.480
meat eaters,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.480
there was connoisseurs of drinks

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.480
and there was others that wanted water

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.480
and it was one of the biggest

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.480
and most expensive riders I had to lay on.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.480
Luckily enough,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.480
not too many of them had riders

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.480
but I certainly remember the Nine Below Zero one

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.480
because it was expensive

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.480
and like I said,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.480
they were fussed over their food

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.480
and their drinks

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.480
and wanted quite a bit of it.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.520
I think there's seven in the band anyway,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.520
you know what?

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.520
I had to wind up in the end as well

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.520
because the roundabout was the last gig I did

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.520
and that was a slot on the dogs from Manchester.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.520
Only six people turned up.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.520
They used to demand me their money before they went on

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520
and I said I haven't got it

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.520
and there were pre-mobile phones and everything like that

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.520
so it was hard to get hold of people

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.520
until I got to the end of the gig.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.560
So anyway,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.560
they were asking me for the money

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.560
and I said we've got a contract

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560
and it says you'll do 60 minutes

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.560
and then I'll pay you the £100.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.560
It doesn't say I'll pay you £100

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560
and then you do the gig.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.560
I said if you want to be funny,

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.560
I'll be funny.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.560
So they went on,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.560
done a half hour

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.560
and came back off

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.560
and said we want the money.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.560
I said I'll give you half the money

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.560
and you've done half the gig.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.560
They phoned me around and said

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.560
I've got the money

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.560
and I've got the money

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.560
and I've got the money

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.600
so they phoned me around people

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.600
trying to get hold of people

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.600
which wasn't easy then,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.600
pre-mobiles

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.600
and we were talking about the money

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.600
and one of the six people out in the audience

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.600
when running past me

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600
I turned around

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.600
and he's grappling with a roadie on the floor

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.600
with a metal bar in his hand

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.600
who was just about to put it over my head.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.600
So he saved my life that night I think

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.640
and I managed to get the money

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.640
but I made them finish their over sack first.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.640
So that was the amount of pork here.
