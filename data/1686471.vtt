00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280
Let us firstly say thank you to Heritage Lottery Wales for supporting this short project of

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:20.240
memories of people who lived and were from Butetown, Tiger Bay, the docks.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.240
And I hope you find the time to listen to it fully.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.240
This next one is from Dowd Suliman, part two.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:45.240
Butetown is a community which could teach our governors how life should be.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.240
You know, if they only took the way people lived in Butetown and put things together

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.240
and had things the same, I'm sure the world would be a much better place.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:06.240
Well, we had a tragedy happen, which shouldn't have happened, where the last man to be hanged in Wales

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:16.240
was a Somali guy who'd come here and he'd married a local girl and had a family.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.240
And he was accused of murdering Mrs. Roberts.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:30.240
She was an old Jewish lady that had a dashery shop and whatnot in Bute Street.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.240
And he had nothing to do with it. He only went to her aid.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.240
But, you know, the police came and arrested him, and as far as they were concerned, he didn't.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.240
And that was it. But years later, his children fought and fought and fought, and they managed to succeed.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:02:00.240
And we had his grave opened up and his body was taken out of the prison and Shigside buried him at our section in Ely Cemetery.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.240
And by then, they'd exhausted that family because his wife and his children, they suffered dearly for what they went through.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.240
And it was just an open and shut case as far as the police were concerned then.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.240
I know they were different times. They didn't have the things that we have today to do their inquiries.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:31.240
But, you know, it was, if you were someone of colour, they rode it through whatever they wanted and that was it.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:41.240
Yeah, that was the problem, wasn't it? You know, all of the decision makers and the courts were outside of the bay.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:51.240
You know, those people under the bridge effectively, under the railway bridge and across the canal, they decided.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:04.240
I mean, I always say to people that whether they like it or not, without the bay, without the docks, without Bute Town, Cardiff would not be the capital of Wales.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:12.240
Exactly, exactly. The area of Bute Town brought character to Cardiff.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.240
And money.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.240
And money, yes, exactly.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.240
Without the docks and the seamen and the shipping company.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:33.240
Yeah, exactly. And Bute Town's got to be recognised and should be proud of that factor, what the people of Bute Town did for Cardiff.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:44.240
I mean, I think that over the years, no group has demonstrated more what becoming a citizen means of a country.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:54.240
I mean, all of the merchants, you know, like my granddad and all the Yemeni and Somali people, they didn't come here asking for anything.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.240
No, they were hard workers.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:07.240
Yeah, and then they had their families and they made their families and their kids respectful and made them citizens of Wales.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.240
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, exactly.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.240
And you know, in the old days on the ships, it wasn't like the ships today.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:22.240
They'd have to go and buy their own bales of hay and whatnot to take on to sleep on, on the ship.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:32.240
They had it really hard, you know, and their rations for food were, you know, the shipping companies didn't want to spend too much on them.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.240
Life was very difficult on the ships in their days.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.240
They didn't. They were always paid a little bit less.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.240
Yeah. And the shipping companies loved them.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.240
The Somalis and the Yemenis, they loved them because they would go on the ship.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.240
And they'd stay on until they were thrown off.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.240
So there was none of this change in crews and whatnot.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
That's why they got on so well.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.240
You know, the shipping companies, that's all they'd use.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.240
One company would use malaise, all malaise, you know, and they'd have their own leader amongst them.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:22.240
And any problems like the captain went to see their leader and he sorted any problems out that they had.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.240
And more or less the same with the Somalis and the Yemenis.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:42.240
They'd have somebody there who would act as their leader, like a spokesman, and they'd take up any issues with the company or the company had come to them and say what they wasn't happy with and whatnot.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.240
And that's how life was.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.240
They left their countries to come to look for a better way of life.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.240
That's all they came for. They didn't come to steal anybody's job.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.240
They were looking for a better life.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.240
And the truth is they could have settled anywhere.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.240
Anywhere.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.240
And they chose the bay and barry for a reason.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.240
Yeah, barry. Thompson Street and barry like this.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:16.240
And like the bay, the minute the docks was running down, they knocked down everything that mattered.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.240
Yeah, all the history gone. Yeah, yeah.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.240
Terrible.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.240
And those people, they were lovely people.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:38.240
I can remember when we used to go to barry from Tadi, all they fussed over us and, you know, we were given sweets and things and whatnot, which we wouldn't normally have.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.240
And they treated us like we'd come from miles and miles away.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.240
And that's how it was.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:55.240
And the same in places when the shipping started to slack off, people started moving inland, you know, to Birmingham and Manchester and whatnot.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:02.240
And the same up there. You know, when you went visiting, you were treated like something special.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.240
So you always looked forward to go visiting in these other places.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:16.240
Yeah, the one thing that's kept though, and I mean, unlike another place that was linked to Cardiff and barry, South Shields.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.240
South Shields, exactly. Which is where it shakes hate. Exactly the same thing.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:26.240
Yeah. That's right. Yeah. They have exactly the same thing there. They have it tough up there.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.240
Yeah. Tougher than the people in Cardiff.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.240
I think because they were more isolated. Cardiff was, the bay was a tighter community.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.240
That's right.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.240
Always taught me they were more vulnerable. You could get to them.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.240
You couldn't get to the bay. You know, the men on the bay could close it down.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.240
The way it was situated. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Exactly.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:57.240
But some of those people, you know, the stories we've heard about them in South Shields, they went through hell.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:06.240
You know, all because of their color, because they came from somewhere other than England.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.240
You know, but they stood their ground and whatnot.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:19.240
And they managed to succeed and carry on with their lives and whatnot there.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:26.240
And some of their women that they married, they would stand up. They were as good as a man.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.240
They'd stand up and defend.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:37.240
When people went to see, I know from sort of my gran, I mean, it was clear listening to her, women ran the family.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.240
Oh, God, yeah.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.240
Everything. Women ran the family. And you were a fool to cross them.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.240
Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's true. Yeah.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.240
You had nine or ten kids. There's got to be something special about you.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:09:00.240
They were good, honest people who just wanted a bit of justice.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:08.240
You know, they wouldn't look into cause problems or anything. They just wanted fairness for everybody.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.240
But they were strong-willed people, strong-willed women.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:20.240
And, you know, they need to be remembered for what they were because they went through some tough time.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:27.240
And people don't get, all of us have got a white grandmother or a white...

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.240
Exactly, yeah.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.240
And they brought us up. They brought us up.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:40.240
Well, you know, when my mother married my dad, she was from the Runnery Valley.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.240
And, you know, she had to come to Cardiff to work when she was 14.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.240
And she worked in the infirmary and lived in there, the infirmary as well, before she met my dad.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:10:00.240
And the people up there in Trinidad, they said, oh, the girl's gone crazy. She's married a heathen.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.240
And this and that.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:11.240
Well, you know, during the war, we were lucky enough because of the ships coming in with everything.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.240
We always had enough to get by.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:29.240
And my dad, he used to send the parcel up to the Trinidad every month with things like butter, cheese, stuff you couldn't buy if you had the money, you know, and tobacco.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:35.240
And then he was the best man in the world, you know.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.240
Yeah.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240
Yeah.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.240
Because no matter what they said, his wife, that was her family.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.240
And family is all greeting.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.240
But those women, they were special women. They were strong.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:55.240
And they stood by their husbands and their family. And they, you know, they would be prepared to fight for them as well.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.240
Which some of them had to do at times.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.240
And they were special women.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.240
And these women, they come from nowhere.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.240
And they took up the language of their husbands.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.240
And most of them spoke a second language.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:19.240
You know, wherever their husbands come from, they learned the language of their husbands.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:25.240
And they were very, very strong women, you know, to have done that.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.240
Yeah. I mean, it's a strange thing, isn't it?

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.240
What you know about where your dad came from and grandparents.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:40.240
And what I know about where my granddad came from, that comes from my nan.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:50.240
And you know, it was, she made sure I knew who he was and where he was from.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.240
Exactly. Yeah. That's good. Yeah.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:06.240
You know, that's, you need to remember the history and the people of those times, what they went through.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.240
Because life must have been pretty tough for them, you know.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.240
Although a lot of them were happy in the end, they succeeded.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.240
They had nice families. They had nice homes.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.240
And they had nothing to worry about.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.240
They didn't come, like you say, looking for trouble or anything.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.240
They came looking to better their lives.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:37.240
And even though they had families here, a lot of them still supported their families that they left behind.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:46.240
And they would send them money and whatnot to help them make a little bit of a better life for themselves where they lived.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.240
So it was good. I mean, my dad, when I was nine years old, my dad sent me out to the Yemen.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.240
And in those days, we had to go by sea. There was no planes and nothing.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:06.240
And we went out on one of the ships, the Uganda, and we were dropped off in Aden.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.240
And from Aden, we made our way up into the Yemen.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.240
Aden was a British protector at that time.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:19.240
And I went out then. I stayed there for two years or more.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.240
And what an experience that was.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:32.240
I went, I mean, in the Yemen, away from Aden, inside the Yemen, it's a country which hasn't changed much since the beginning of time.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.240
It's like going back 2,000 years in history. And it's still the same.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:42.240
But it was a great experience for me because people treated me like I was a king there.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:52.240
And my dad used to send me two pounds every month for pocket money.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.240
And I couldn't spend that two pounds. I still had money left over at the end of the month.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.240
And things were cheap. Things were honest and whatnot.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.240
But even it's something the same, even in the Yemen today, the Yemen has changed.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:16.240
They've had these rich Saudis have taken a seat.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.240
They're trying to exploit the Yemen and the Emirates.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.240
They're all trying to exploit the Yemen. But the Yemen will never change.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:33.240
They've had troubles before. And they've got over them. And they'll survive this as well.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:39.240
It must have been interesting for you seeing where your dad came from.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:47.240
And maybe understanding what it must have been like when he was actually arriving in other places.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:52.240
Suddenly there's all this busyness and the docks and...

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.240
Oh, God, yeah. It made you think.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:05.240
When I first got there, when we got into the Yemen, into the village where I stay, nobody spoke English.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:12.240
So I sat there and thought, what have I done?

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:19.240
But people were so good and nice and comforting.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:27.240
I thought I'd better learn the language quick. I could speak a little bit then, but not a great deal.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.240
And within six months I was away speaking.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:41.240
And everybody loved one another. Then these things were different there.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.240
It's hard to see these changes.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:55.240
It's interesting though, isn't it? Because language... You think you're speaking the language until you arrive.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:03.240
It's like somebody from Oxford arriving in the bay.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:13.240
There's phrases and things that people say that make no sense to an outsider.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:17.240
No, that's right. And that's our home.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.240
Well, like I say, I spent 35 years traveling.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:34.240
And one of the best feelings was when you came back on the train from London and you smelt the fish by the railway station.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.240
And that smell identified with home.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.240
And it was great. You were back here.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.240
I was saying about language. A friend of mine says, what does that mean in Wales?

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.240
He said, what do you mean? He said, now in a minute.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:59.240
Yeah, now in a minute.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.240
And those little things won't be there.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:08.240
Yeah, that's right. Who's caught in this jacket?

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.240
They don't get it. We think it's funny too.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:20.240
Okay, I've taken a lot of your time up, man.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.240
You're welcome.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.240
Let me ask you something, right.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:33.240
You're back to this imaginary person that's having a cup of coffee and they're looking at all of those new shops and restaurants.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:47.240
And one thing they don't know is if they'd have walked along those, you know, Bute Street and the other streets when they were, when we were kids, they'd have smelt more food from around the world.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.240
Oh, God, yeah. They would have had the aromas of the different spices.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.240
And the place was alive.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.240
We used to eat from all the way around the world. We used to eat English food.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:07.240
We used to eat Somali food. Proper Chinese, proper cooked food.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:13.240
But okay, so we're back to this person. What would you say to them?

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:20.240
As they're looking across, you know, they're from the Norwegian church, all those shops. What would you say to them?

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:31.240
I'd say if only you knew what went on in this area many, many years ago before it was redeveloped.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:42.240
This place was a bustling with workers, stockers and people working in the factories and whatnot, going about their everyday business.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:54.240
It was alive and it provided a living for the majority of people in places such as Butone and Cranestone.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.240
And it was a different place, like what it is today.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:08.240
But the memories of the years gone by, they were good too. It's a bit more luxurious there.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:14.240
I can remember the Norwegian church when it was in an original spot.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:22.240
My friend used to clean it for six months, six months a week. He used to go in and clean it up.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:31.240
And I mean now they've moved it to where it is and it's very nice and beautiful and a place to be proud of.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:40.240
But it had a lot of history in days gone by, passed through that church, the Norwegian church.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.240
Heaven knows how much disappeared when they knocked down the houses.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:50.240
That's right. Oh God, it was a shame. They were beautiful houses.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:58.240
I mean you had billionaires living in the area before those people and all the well to do.
