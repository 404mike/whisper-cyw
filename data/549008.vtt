00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Rwy'n dweud rhai ffordd i mi yna.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Pan oeddwn i'n 15, roeddwn i'n gweithio yn Ffactor Denix, mae'n ffactor sŵr.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
A ydym ni'n mynd.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Felly, gallwch chi ddweud i mi eich anffodus a'ch datblygu, fyddwch?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Sonya Gould, 19 diwrnod 1941.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Felly, gallwch chi ddweud i ni am eich anffodus a'ch datblygu, ychydig, pan oeddwch chi'n nifodd, ffawr a ffawr?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Roeddwn i'n nifodd yn Cardiff a mynd i'r Trudeegau pan oeddwn i'n 12.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Mae gen i ddwy oedau.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Roeddwn i'n gweithio pan oeddwn i'n 25.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
A yna roeddwn i'n ddwy oed.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Beth am eich ffawr a ffawr? Beth yw'r hyn?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Roedd fy fater yn y ffatri, roedd yn gweithio ar gyfer y boelwyr a'n gweithio yn gweithio yn gwaith yn oed.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Roedd fy moth wedi bod yn gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio hefyd.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Roeddwn yn gweithio ar y gau y ffatri, oherwydd roeddwn yn cael ei ddod o'r Cardiff oherwydd roeddwn yn cael ei ddod o'r gweithio.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Roeddwn yn cael ei ddod o'r gweithio.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Roeddwn yn cael ei ddod o'r Gweithd muti cyflawn, pall commentaeth, a chais.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.720
Roeddwn yn gweithio ar gyfer ein ffur iawn oherwydd yr hyn, sef tafodol.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.000
Maeевойwyd yr hyn, a phadech 연 yn yr ar 14 gofn Sierra.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Roeddwn yn gweithio ar 12.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.800
Maenewch yna rwy'r cyllideb….

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.800
Pan oeddwn i yn Caerdydd, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddwylo a'r ddwylo ymlaen.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.800
Felly pan oeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddwylo ymlaen, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddwylo ymlaen, Gwlaenawi.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.800
A pan oeddwch chi'n mynd i'r ddwylo a…

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddwylo yn 15.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800
Sori, dweud hynny arni angen.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.800
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddwylo yn 15 oherwydd roeddwn i'n gwybod gwaith i fynd yn y ffacry.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.800
Oherwydd yno ystod y ddwylo, roeddwn i'n mynd i fy fater a roedd yn gweithio ar y ffacry.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.800
Oherwydd roedd nhw'n bethnoel, barthach, oherwng, allan y speciall.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.800
Roeddwn i'n gallu defnyddio'r ffacry yn fawr, ond roeddwn i'n gwybod yn y ffacry.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.800
Beth oeddwch chi'n mynd i'r ddwylo o ran ysgol?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.800
Dwi ddim yn gwybod, dwi ddim yn gobeithio yn ysgol.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.800
Dwi ddim yn dda iawn ysgol.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.800
Oherwydd fy ffacry fynd yma, roeddwn i'n fwynoch chi oherwydd roedd wedi'i ddweud yn ffacry.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.800
Rwy'n ffwrdd a roeddwn i'n ffwyno'r hyn.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.800
Ond roedd yna ddwylo yn y ffacry, ond roeddwn i'n mynd i weithio a gael gwybodaeth.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.800
Roedd hi'n fwyno gwybodaeth.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.800
Felly, sut ydych chi'n teimlo yna am fynd i'r ffacry?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.800
Mae'n dda, roedd fy môr yno a fy fater.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.800
Roeddwn i'n gwybod, oherwydd rydym wedi'i ddod yn y ddwylo, roeddwn i'n gwybod.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800
Roedd nhw'n cael y hŵta i'n mynd.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800
Roedd nhw'n cael y hŵta i'n mynd, a yna rydych chi'n mynd i'r ffacry.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.800
Y hŵta o'n mynd ar 8 o'r oed, a yna rydych chi'n mynd i'r ddwylo.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.800
Mae'n anodd i'r ddwylo, ond oherwydd rydym wedi'i ddod yn y ddwylo,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.800
roeddwn yn gwybod, roeddwn yn gwybod sut ydych chi'n cael y gwaith.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.800
Felly, fy fater.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.800
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r gwaith, roedd fy fater wedi'i cael fy gwaith,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.800
ac roedd nhw wedi dod i mi, roedd y gwaith yng Nghymru wedi'i cael,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.800
a roedd yn dweud, rwy'n ddiddorol, dwi'n ddod, dylai, rwy'n rhaid i chi ddod i hefyd.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.800
Sofais.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.800
Roedd yn cael ei ddod i hefyd, a rwy'n dweud,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.800
why have I got to go home?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.800
Roedd yna dweud, because they are shouting up on the floor,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.800
because they are laying people off, and they have started you,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.800
and it's not on.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.800
Felly, roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ddwylo, i'r bos, a'i dweud,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.800
Sonia, roedd yn dweud, I can't, I've got to dismiss you,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.800
roeddwn i'n mynd i'r holl.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.800
Roeddwn i'n llwyfio ar y ddau'r ddau oherwydd

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.800
roeddwn i'n gallu gweld y ffactor a fyddai'n mynd i'n mynd i'r gweithio

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.800
ac roeddwn i'n mynd i'r gweithio

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800
a dwi'n mynd i'r gweithio a dwi'n mynd i'r gweithio

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.800
ond roedd wedi'i gael fy nghyfn i'w ddwylo.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.800
Roedd yn dweud,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.800
roedd yn dweud, iawn,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800
a roeddwn i'n mynd i'r gweithio o 6 weiciau

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.800
ond roeddwn yn mynd i'r gweithio

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800
yn ystraddau ar y stric

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.800
Roeddwn yn dweud,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800
roeddwn yn dweud,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.800
oherwydd roedd wedi'i ddod o bobl

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800
oherwydd roedd wedi'i ddod o bobl

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800
roedd yn dweud, why the electrician's daughter

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.800
should have been starting work.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800
Right.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.800
So, did that,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.800
you know,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.800
did that carry on

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.800
or were they okay to you afterwards?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.800
No, they were alright.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.800
It was just that they didn't think it was fair.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.800
They've

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.800
striked over a lot of things.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.800
They did. We run the factory,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.800
really, we did.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.800
If we couldn't have the radio on,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.800
they'd strike.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800
And if it was too cold, they'd go out on strike.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.800
And

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.800
they just wanted

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.800
to rule the place.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.800
One time we was out on strike,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.800
all the machines would go off and you'd think,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.800
what's up, what's up,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.800
everybody's shut the machine off.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.800
And all out, all out, and we'd all have to go

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.800
over the canteen. But this one

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.800
day, we all walked out

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.800
and he locked us in behind the gates.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.800
He locked us

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.800
out.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.800
But it was only something trivial,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.800
I think, it was, you know.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.800
But at a Christmas

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.800
time, we'd

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.800
work until twelve and then you'd

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.800
have a drink, you'd take bottles of drinking.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.800
Well, by one o'clock, you was

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.800
all sloshed

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.800
in the factory with all the trimmings

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.800
hanging up. And we used to have Elvis

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.800
and Cliff Richards on our

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.800
machines.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.800
And it was like rivalry,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.800
like I'm Elvis fan and then

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.800
Cliff Richards fan me at the side of him.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.800
But it was

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.800
on a line, it was very,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.800
very good. And then

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.800
you'd go out the toilet and have a cigarette

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.800
and sit on the floor.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.800
But you'd have about a quarter of an hour

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.800
and you'd have to come back in then.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.800
But supervisors were very

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.800
kind, they were, they was good.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.800
But once I'd done the button

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.800
hole in of the flyer, the

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.800
trousers, I could work my

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.800
way back up the line and then

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.800
I'd go out the toilet and come

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.800
back in and catch up again.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.800
But that

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.800
was the type of thing it was,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.800
like you, you,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.800
well, you were all

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.800
jolly together, we loved it.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.800
OK. Now let me

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.800
ask you, we haven't talked about

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.800
the name of the factory and

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.800
you know, I'd like to

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.800
go back to, you know, the first,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.800
when you were there first

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.800
of all and what it felt like and what you

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.800
remember from, you know, those

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.800
first days after you went back

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.800
then after the sixth year.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.800
Well, I went back and

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.800
then there was this supervisor,

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.800
I don't know if she liked me very

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.800
much, but she used to give me

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800
little pieces of material

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.800
to practice on

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.800
and they were called patches.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.800
They

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.800
hang on jackets with the buttons on them

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.800
and then you'd have to do

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.800
about 100 for about a shilling.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.800
You know,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.800
it was a lot of hard work because you were on

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.800
piecework and

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.800
I didn't like that very much.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.800
Well then I went to Winnie

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.800
the union woman and I said, well,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.800
I can't earn my money on

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.800
those patches. So

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.800
I was moved then and

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.800
I went on to buttonholing on the line.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.800
So, you know,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.800
when you were doing the patches, was that a kind

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.800
of training then?

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.800
No, that was just a job, putting

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.800
buttons on material and it was only squares.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.800
Well,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.800
the money wasn't there

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.800
and you were on piecework, so you

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.800
had to do so many and

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.800
I didn't like it. I wanted to be on the

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.800
buttonholing machine.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.800
But, you know,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.800
it was, well,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.800
as I said, you got into it

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.800
liking it, but everybody knew me

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800
through my parents.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.800
Did you get any training though?

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.800
Only with my father.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800
So he trained?

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.800
On a Saturday morning.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.800
I used to go up the factory, working

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.800
on a Saturday morning and he'd

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.800
put me on the machines and train

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.800
me. But other people,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.800
if you've got a job,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.800
you've got a supervisor working

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.800
with you and showing

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.800
you the machines.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.800
But I was already qualified before

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.800
I went in there.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.800
So the factory was called

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.800
Denix? Denix.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.800
Denix factory.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.800
Because when I

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.800
used to go up, when I was in school and my

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.800
father'd be working, and

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.800
they were making children's

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.800
clothes, coats

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.800
and bonnets and all things like that.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.800
Because we used to

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.800
wear the clothes.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.800
But when

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.800
Harvey's, I think

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.800
it was, Harvey's come and took

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.800
over from Denix.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.800
And they were

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.800
donkey jackets and duffel coats.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.800
And they went for a couple of years

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.800
doing that. Then they sold out

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.800
to Clifford Williams and Sen.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.800
And you said

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.800
Denix did, what kind of clothes did Denix

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.800
do? Children's clothes.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.800
What did Clifford Williams do then?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.800
They'd done donkey jackets and

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.800
trousers and duffel

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.800
and jackets.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.800
So while you were there, the whole

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.800
production changed? Yeah.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.800
Yeah. But on

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.800
buttonholing and overlocking

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.800
and the specials,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.800
it was the same work.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.800
But you had to earn your money.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.800
You'd have to do, like,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.800
overtime and that. I think

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.800
well I had £5 for a week.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.800
I'll just take you

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.800
back a minute and ask you about pay now.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.800
But when your father

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.800
took you there, did you have to

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.800
have a kind of interview or anything?

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.800
Or did they just give you the job?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.800
No, they gave me the job because

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.800
I was always up there

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.800
with my father anyway.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.800
And the bosses like Mr. White

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.800
and that knew me.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.800
Yeah.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.800
And did you enjoy the

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.800
work in the factory then?

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800
Oh yeah. We run

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.800
it. We run it.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.800
I left

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.800
for a week.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.800
I was getting a bit fed up

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.800
and my mother, if they were

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.800
striking, my mother'd say sit down, you're not

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.800
striking with them. And I thought, oh,

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.800
she said, no, you look bad

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.800
on your father, you'd better stay where you are.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.800
But I went over to Rhymney,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.800
that's over the

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.800
mountain, to Smiths

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.800
and they were a sewing factory.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.800
And I went for a week.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.800
And I had bus sickness

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.800
and I couldn't stick it and you

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.800
wasn't allowed to talk because

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.800
then it's ruined out for working

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.800
anywhere else. So I

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.800
worked my week in hand and come back.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.800
I come back.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.800
I didn't

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.800
like Smiths. It was

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.800
so different to our factory.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.800
They were very, very

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.800
strict. You had to put your hand up to

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.800
go to the toilet and you wasn't allowed to talk

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.800
to the girl next to you,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.800
which our factory was totally different to that.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.800
So at Danx, do you think they were good

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.800
employers? Very good.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.800
Yeah.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.800
So, you know,

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.800
you started talking about what you did

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.800
in the factory. Did your work

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.800
change over the years?

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.800
You know, from when you began?

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.800
No, no,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.800
we were always working on jackets and

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.800
you know, it's so

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.800
funny because

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.800
they'd start on the line by

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.800
you and by the time they got down

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.800
to the bottom of the line,

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.800
there was two jackets missing

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.800
and nobody knew where

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.800
they went, didn't they?

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.800
Or they were taking parts so

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.800
when they'd go home they'd sew them and

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.800
make them up, make a jacket

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.800
up when they get home, you know?

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.800
But that went on, I mean,

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.800
that went on, people knew. And

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.800
cotton reels,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.800
you were allowed to take cotton reels home.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.800
You could have the cotton reels,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.800
you know, they never stopped you.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.800
I mean, nobody done a lot

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.800
of pinching, but

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.800
you could have a reel of white cotton

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.800
if you wanted it, like you knew

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.800
they didn't stop you doing that.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.800
You know?

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.800
I think I got one reels

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.800
here from the factory.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.800
But, you know,

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.800
it wasn't, well,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.800
as I said, they were pretty lenient

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.800
with us. And who had a canteen

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.800
where you had food?

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.800
You go and have food.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.800
Do you want to ask that?

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.800
Here we go then.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.800
I was going to ask you, I know

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.800
I asked you what was it

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.800
like when you first worked, but what was it

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.800
like, the sights and the smells

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.800
of the place? Can you describe the factory

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.800
to me? Yeah.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.800
Erm, we had

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.800
chalk.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.800
We used to chalk,

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.800
you had to mark your

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.800
garment. So the chalk

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.800
and everything, the smell

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.800
of all the cottons and that,

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.800
because all the alleyways around

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.800
the lines were all like

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.800
fluff. So you had a lot

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.800
of fluff with the pieces

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.800
of material.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.800
They had a big cutting room they did

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800
and that cutting room,

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.800
they'd done layers and layers of material

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.800
and they had like

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.800
band knives. They were very

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.800
long knives and

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.800
like you had big things like that

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.800
that you pushed through the band knife

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.800
and they'd cut hundreds of patterns

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.800
out in one go.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.800
Well before they came on the line

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.800
and that was called the cutting

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.800
room. Well there was about

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.800
12 people working in there.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.800
And erm

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.800
before it came out on

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.800
the floor. But it did smell

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.800
like erm, I

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.800
can't explain, like

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.800
fluffy material. I mean

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.800
I expect we had, I don't know,

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.800
the fluff was everywhere

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.800
because you had it all on your

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.800
clothes and your hair.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.800
Especially on the duffel coats

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.800
because they were

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.800
thick material.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.800
And erm.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.800
Was it a good smell? Yeah.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.800
Yeah. You were used to

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.800
it. You'd go in in the morning

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.800
and well it was just

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.800
you got used to it.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.800
Did you wear any protection

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.800
on your? No.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.800
Do you think you should have?

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.800
I think we should have

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.800
especially working on that

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.800
fluffy stuff like in there.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.800
When you press your button on your buttonhole

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.800
erm

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.800
I mean I was going round in like

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.800
that doing the buttonhole

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.800
where the fluff was coming up

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.800
onto your face and

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.800
but they never

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.800
thought of things like that in them days

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.800
did they? No they didn't.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.800
Because we had silks

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.800
for the lining of the jacket. You had

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.800
silk and they were all

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.800
that was all erm

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.800
that was all fluffy and threading.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.800
All the threads was all on the floor

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.800
from the cut-ins

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.800
and that.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.800
And trousers you didn't think

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.800
that the duffel coats

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.800
was the worst.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.800
You know.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.800
Was the condition of the factory, did it feel clean?

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.800
Oh yeah they had

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.800
cleaners.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.800
They had cleaners going round in

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.800
when you left work

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.800
the cleaners would come in and sweep

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.800
they'd sweep all the fluff.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.800
You wouldn't have yesterday's

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.800
bits and bobs all on the floor

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.800
that would be gone.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.800
And they had

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.800
a cleaner in the toilet.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.800
The toilet was clean.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.800
But erm, one day

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.800
one girl, somebody threw a cotton

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.800
reel at her and she had locked

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.800
her jaw. She threw it across

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.800
the factory

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.800
onto the other line and she had

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.800
locked jaw. But erm

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.800
you would fool about, you could fool about

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.800
they didn't stop

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.800
you like in it.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.800
And they'd shout over and you know

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.800
and you had like Silla Black

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.800
playing over on the radio.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.800
And it was allowed and they'd all be

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.800
singing to Silla Black.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.800
Erm.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.800
Do you remember what the programmes were? You know.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.800
And do you remember what the songs were?

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.800
Yeah, it was erm

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.800
You're My World

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.800
with Silla Black. It was all

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.800
fifties music.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.800
And it was records

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.800
because they had a record

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.800
machine up the office.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.800
And they used to play all the records.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.800
Or you'd bring your own records in and they'd

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.800
play them for you. You could

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.800
do that.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.800
But you went in relays

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.800
to the canteen.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.800
Like say

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.800
past twelve you a line would go.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.800
And then one o'clock another line would go.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.800
So, you know.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.800
But you could have hot meal.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.800
Or you could have sandwiches

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.800
and tea and that.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.800
And they had a boiler house.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.800
Well the boiler house used to

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.800
make all the heating you know.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.800
Because my father, there was a man

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.800
working in the boiler house.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.800
From over the valley.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.800
But erm, you didn't

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.800
take any notice of the smell.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.800
I think Denix smelled

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.800
Denix like it was a factory.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.800
Yeah.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.800
You'd accept it that.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.800
And if he was getting married they'd tie

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.800
you to the machine with all things on it.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.800
If he was getting married

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.800
they'd done that to me and I was nearly

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.800
dying. My mother and father was there.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.800
But erm

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.800
it was the best place.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.800
We all say now we've

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.800
nowhere in our seventies we wish it was

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.800
we were still going.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.800
Because we meet up all the girls

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.800
in Tudiga. We see them.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.800
They'd go out yeah like a

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.800
they're like sisters they are.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.800
Because we had that bond you know.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.800
Like erm, we went

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.800
in the toilet one day and this girl

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.800
pierced my ears with a needle

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.800
and soap.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.800
But erm, you know

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.800
I was only about seventeen and I was

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.800
bleeding on my ear.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.800
But no it was a good

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.800
place to work.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.800
The companionship was there.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.800
Because this one girl

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.800
was from Rhymney was going to beat

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.800
my friend up in it. And then

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.800
there was about ten waiting for her outside.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.800
They wouldn't have touched her like

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.800
you know they were that

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.800
close that you

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.800
they were ganged up with her you know they

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.800
wouldn't have her.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.800
So did you go there?

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.800
You know you said your

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.800
your mum was there yeah?

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.800
Your dad was there. Did you go there

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.800
with girls from school?

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.800
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.800
And girls who lived around the factory

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.800
in the streets.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.800
Because once the Oota would go

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.800
they'd come from all the streets around

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.800
you know.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.800
And they had a little

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.800
two shops, two little shops at the bottom

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.800
of the road. And that's where

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.800
you'd get your sweets or whatever for dinner.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.800
And then the Oota would go

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.800
and you'd be going walking back.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.800
But it was about

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.800
300 people there.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.800
Were you mainly

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.800
women or women and men?

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.800
Women and men but the

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.800
men were more or less in the cutting room.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.800
And they had supervisor men

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.800
on the presses.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.800
Because we had automatic big

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.800
presses to press the

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.800
jackets and that. And they

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.800
were overseeing

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.800
the presses.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.800
The men.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.800
So how many women say to men?

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.800
Do you think?

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.800
I would say there would only be about

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.800
40 men.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.800
And all the rest was women.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.800
So hundreds of women?

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.800
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.800
Did Tridiga women go and work

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.800
anywhere else?

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.800
Yeah, some went to

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.800
the bra factory in

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.800
Ebbw Vale, Burleys.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.800
And a lot went

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.800
to the Smiths.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.800
So that sewing factory in Rhymney.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.800
Some didn't come to Denix,

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.800
they just went to Smiths.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.800
You know.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.800
Or when that day I went looking for a job

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.800
I went over Triang.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.800
In Merthyr. That was a

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.800
Triang Toys. That was a

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.800
big factory over there.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.800
But I didn't get a job over there.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.800
So could you walk?

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.800
You could walk to work then? Yeah.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.800
I could see the factory.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.800
The factory was like those houses

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.800
over there. It was only the distance of

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.800
looking at the factory. I was looking

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.800
at it every day. And was that

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.800
okay? Yeah.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.800
Yeah. That's why I wanted a brick

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.800
when it broke.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.800
Well it was lovely, it was lovely.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.800
But it was turned into

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.800
I mean it shut for

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.800
a long time. Years.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.800
And then this other firm

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.800
took over and they were making plastic

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.800
bowls.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.800
And they took it over, the LCR did.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.800
But

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.800
as I said I got married

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.800
and I didn't go, you know, I never went

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.800
back there. But my mother and

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.800
father stayed there.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.800
They worked until it closed.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.800
Okay. I'll get to

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.800
that in a bit.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.800
Can you just, we'll go back to

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.800
when they did children's clothes,

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.800
where were those clothes?

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.800
Do you know who, where

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.800
they went? They went to London.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.800
Burton on Trent.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.800
Because

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.800
my father was driving the van

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.800
and when we were little, we used to go

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.800
in the van with him and he'd take us to

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.800
Burton on Trent or we'd stay in London

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.800
or all different

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.800
places he'd be delivering.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.800
They'd all be hanging

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.800
on rails in the back of the van.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.800
It was a massive van mount.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.800
The size of two houses.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.800
Big van. With

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.800
Donald Duck on it and Mickey Mouse.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.800
Do you know

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.800
what shops they went to? No.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.800
What about

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.800
the Deffles and the Donkey Jackets?

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.800
Where did they go?

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.800
I don't know. We just used

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.800
to see them packed up in boxes.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.800
You know.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.800
But like this

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.800
one supervisor,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.800
she, Biddy, she

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.800
she'd done a whole section

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.800
of jackets

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.800
and the button

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.800
also, well she'd done, she'd

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.800
made a mistake on the, on the form

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.800
and she had to sack.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.800
Because she'd done a whole

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.800
range wrong

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.800
and they sacked her.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.800
I remember that.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.800
Because she, well she did something

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.800
different to the sheet.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.800
But, erm.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.800
Were the union unhappy about that?

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.800
No.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.800
The union didn't interfere.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.800
But one time when

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.800
I was working, I went

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.800
up the office and he said that I could have a

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.800
shilling. A shilling for about

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.800
a dozen I think it was.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.800
And I came home and I said,

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.800
Mamar, I'm having a shilling for a dozen.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.800
I said, I've earned some money,

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.800
innit? Well, when I went

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.800
back to work,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.800
this union woman, Conor, and she said,

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.800
he's not giving you a shilling,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.800
you can have nine pence.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.800
I said, I was six pence and three pence, wasn't it?

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.800
You can have it for nine pence?

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.800
No, I said, he didn't say nine pence

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.800
in the office.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.800
So she took me up the office and I said to him,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.800
no you didn't. I said,

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.800
because I went home and told my mother and father

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.800
I was excited to what you'd given me.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.800
I said, you didn't give me nine pence,

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.800
I didn't back down.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.800
And, you know, he just

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.800
went like that. I said, no,

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.800
because he knew that I could have earned a good bit

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.800
of money on piecework, doing

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.800
that for the shilling.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.800
But no, he didn't change his mind.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.800
But I mean,

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.800
I went up with the union woman on her own

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.800
because she was a very good

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.800
union woman. But I didn't

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.800
tell fibs or I didn't

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.800
think, ooh, he's a boss,

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.800
innit? I had just said

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.800
the truth, you know?

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.800
And I said, no, you're not backing me down because

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.800
but then he realised

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.800
what he'd given me that I could have

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.800
earned a good bit of money.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.800
Yn oed.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.800
Felly,

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.800
oedd yn dweud i mi dydau

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.800
o'r ffordd? Ie, 19

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.800
o'r 9, 1941.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.800
1941, o'r hyn,

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.800
iawn.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.800
Roeddwn i'n mynd i ddweud,

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.800
felly, roeddwch wedi mynd i weithio yno

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.800
yn 1956, yna? Roeddwch?

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.800
Roeddwn i'n 25.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.800
Nid,

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.800
roeddwch wedi dweud, roeddwch wedi weithio

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.800
15?

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.800
15.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.800
Felly, yw hynny,

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.800
roeddwch wedi mynd i weithio yno yn 19?

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.800
Ych chi'n dweud i mi, roeddwch yn dweud,

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.800
roeddwch yn dweud, roeddwch yn dweud, roeddwch yn dweud,

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.800
yn 1941?

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.800
Yn 1956, iawn?

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.800
1956 oedd yno.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.800
Oherwydd y gallai'r uniau hynny

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.800
oedd yno pan oeddwn i'n mynd i weithio.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.800
Oherwydd roeddwch wedi dweud,

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.800
yna, mae'n 1956.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.800
Felly,

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.800
roeddwch wedi mynd i weithio gyda chi?

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.800
Ie.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.800
Felly roeddwch yn gallu gwneud yn ystod?

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.800
Ystod.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.800
Ond roeddwch wedi mynd i weithio,

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.800
pan oeddwch wedi mynd i weithio?

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.800
Roeddwch wedi mynd i weithio yn 1966.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.800
A?

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.800
Yna, roeddwn i'n adleu,

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.800
ac roeddwn i ddim weithio,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.800
roeddwn i ddim weithio yn ôl.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.800
Rwy'n dda, felly roeddwch wedi mynd i weithio yn ystod?

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.800
Yn ystod.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.800
Roedd fy mwyaf a phobl yn weithio yn ystod, oherwydd?

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.800
Roedd yn dda i weithio yn ystod, oherwydd?

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.800
Nid.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.800
Roedd fy mwyaf yn dda, roedd yn ystod,

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.800
ac roedd wedi gwneud

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.800
gweithio'n dda, a'i tynnu.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.800
Roedd yn ystod, yna.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.800
Ond nid,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.800
pan oedd yn ystod gweithio,

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.800
roedd yn dda i weithio,

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.800
rydych chi'n gwybod.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.800
Rwy'n credu, roedd yn cymryd pobl

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.800
yn ystod, efallai,

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.800

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.800
yn ystod, efallai, os oes gennych chi?

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.800
Rwy'n credu, mae fy mwyaf

yn ystod gweithio i weithio,

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.800
dwi nid wedi gwneud, ond roedd

Roedd wedi gwneud hynny

Ond nid, rwy'n credu, mae'n gwybod,

mae'n gwybod,

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.800
fel roedd yn eich hun,

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.800

A roedd yn credu

roedd yn gwybod beth roedd yn ei wneud,

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.800
oherwydd nid oes unrhyw un o'n

roedd yn gwybod y ddau o'r

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.800
dechrau'r ddechrau,

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.800
y ddau a'r holl

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.800
gwaith,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.800
yn ymwneud â'r gwaith,

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.800
ac yna, yw, byddwch chi'n swaith arall,

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.800
fel y byddwch chi'n gwybod fy modd yno,

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.800
yn gwneud batonolion ar y ddau,

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.800
neu byddwch chi'n gwybod fy modd

rwy'n meddwl, roedden nhw'n cael eu fflotwr yna.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.800
A beth oedd hynny'n debyg?

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.800
Byddwch chi'n fflotwr arall ar y ffactor.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.800
Yn y ddau,

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.800
os ydyn nhw eisiau i'w gwneud yno,

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.800
byddwch chi'n mynd yno yn gwneud batonolion

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.800
ac yna byddwch chi'n dod yn ôl

Felly byddwch chi'n fflotwr,

Felly byddwch chi'n fflotwr arall ar y ddau?

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.800
Arall arall.

Byddwch chi'n gwneud unrhyw gweithredu?

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.800
Nid.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.800
Dyna'r man?

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.800
Dyna'r man.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.800
Oherwydd ym Mhrys Lleidydd, roedden nhw'n gweithredu ar y ddau,

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.800
a byddwch chi'n fflotwr bach,

byddwch chi'n fflotwr bach.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.800
Ym Mhrys Lleidydd?

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.800
Ym Mhrys Lleidydd, Ym Mhrys Lleidydd Evans.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.800
Ym Mhrys Lleidydd?

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.800
Ie, roedd yn fy nghyfnod, roedd hefyd yn y Prif Ab yn oed.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.800
Mae'n bwysig iawn i'r ddau.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.800
Ond mae'n siarad am

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.800
un bwyr bach

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.800
yn oed,

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.800
oherwydd roedd wedi'i ddwylo'r material

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.800
drwy'r ddau

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.800
oherwydd y ddau

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.800
yn y pêl.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.800
Beth yw'r ddau ddau ddau?

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.800
Mae'n ddau bach sy'n

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.800
ac y ddau

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.800
yn oed,

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.800
a'r pêl o material

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.800
bydd yn oed fel hyn.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.800
Yn oed? Yn oed.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.800
Yn oed.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.800
A bydd yn bwysig iawn

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.800
drwy'r ddau.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.800
Y ddau bydd yn mynd i'w ddweud

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.800
fel hyn, fel siarad

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.800
am y pêl.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.800
Oherwydd roedd wedi cael

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.800
gwybwynt y pêl

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.800
oherwydd roedd yn mynd i'w ddweud

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.800
i'w ddweud yn y cerddor.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.800
Roedd hwn yn cael gwybwynt

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.800
ac efallai y ddau bydd yn

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.800

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.800
coffyn ac amdanoed.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.800
Yna byddwn yn mynd i'w ddweud

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.800

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.800
ar gyfer y cerddor.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.800
Ond mae'r gwasanaidd

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.800
wedi bod yn rhan.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.800
Felly roedd

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.800
gwasanaidd ffysig

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.800
ar y cerddor?

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.800
Ar y cerddor, mae'n bwysig i'w ddweud.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.800
Roedd yn unrhyw un yn ei wneud.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:18.800
Yr hyn rwy'n siarad â chi yw, oherwydd y ddweud y byddai'r mhen yn y cyffredin,

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:24.800

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.800
O, dydyn nhw ddim yn rhoi'r gweithiau.

Ond ydy'n oes oherwydd y byddai'n ei wneud?

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.800
Oherwydd y cwp.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.800
Roedd y gweithiau'n ddangos.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.800
Roedd y cwp yn mynd yn y blynyddoedd yn oed yn llawer o'r amser,

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.800
yn oed yn llawer o'r amser,

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.800
a'i ddangos yn ddangos yn fwy, fwy, fwy, fwy i gael gwaith i'r gwaith,

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.800
yn y gwaith yn y bwyll.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.800
Rwy'n credu bod yna ddwy o'r cyffredin,

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.800
ym Mhryd Llawn a'r holl ddwy oedd.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.800
Roedd yna ddwy o'r gwaith i'r ffyrdd.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.800
Ond mae'r bobl yn gweithio yn y cyffredin,

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:07.800
roedd yna ddwy o'r gwaith yn ymwneud i gael gwaith,

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.800
a'i ddangos yn y ffyrdd.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.800
Roedd yna dwy o'r gwaith,

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.800
gwaith oedynol,

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.800
felly roedd yna llawer o ffyrdd,

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.800
y gwaith yn y gwaith.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.800
Mae'n gweithio llawer o ffyrdd.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.800
Roedd yna llawer o ffyrdd.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.800
Felly, roeddech chi'n mynd i'r ddwy oedd yn y ffyrdd,

Oherwydd roedd gennych chi'n ffrindiau,

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.800

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.800
A, fel Janet Price,

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.800

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.800
Roedd eu ffrindiau yn oed yn oed,

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.600
Oherwydd roeddwn yn cael ffermwyr ymgyrch yn y canthin

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:39.600
a'r holl bobl yn cael ffermwyr ymgyrch.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.600

Dyna lle rydyn ni'n cael ein holl bobl.

Rwy'n cwblio ymlaen ymlaen,

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.600
Beth oedd ei ddau?

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.600
Roeddwn yn cael ei ddau yn ymlaen.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.600
Roedd ymlaen yn cael ei ddau,

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.600

roedd fy fater yn cael am 6 meysiau ymlaen,

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.600
a ddau meysiau ar-lechi a hynny.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.600
Roedd gen feddwl i ni,

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.600
na fyddwn yn defnyddchten,

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.600
ei hunrol ei hollol Personzoethus,

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.600
a uneithio ar Lawy Liogood Cymru.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.600
Doeddwn yn gallu cofio bod.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.600
Roeddwn yn cwblio ymlaen i fy fater.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.600
din Cabinet yn cael ei dyuai yn gy сохранad,

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:40.160

modd gwasgyn orau iawn y cam.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.640
ac roeddwn yn y cyntaf.

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.880
Ond roeddwn wedi gwneud gyrsoddiad yn y canthin,

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.720
ac yn y stade.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.440
A'r rhai o'r gyrsoddiad oedd yn tŷ,

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.040
o'r amser roeddwn yn gwneud y can, can, a dwi ddim yn gwybod.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:04.200
Ond, y rhai o'r gyrsoddiad, fel yna, roeddwn yn gobeithio hynny.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.600
Felly roedd ymddygiad Denix sy'n arraignio'r gyrsoddiad,

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.600
neu roedd yn ymddygiad ymweldwyd?

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.800
Nid, roedd ymddygiad Clifford Williams yn ystod.

Roedd ymddygiad Denix,

Felly roedden nhw'n angen beth yw'r penderfyniadau'r ddifnyddio'r rhain?

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.240

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.960
Ond roedd yn cael ei ddifnyddio'n Denix.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.160
Ie, i chi?

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.200
I'r holl fater, fel y byddai'n ddaethu'r ddifnyddio'r rhain.

Roedd yn gweithio yn Denix a hynny,

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:49.320
oherwydd byddai'n gweld fel Denix.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.160
Felly roedd ymddygiad yna,

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.800

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.480

Roedd yn ym Mhob.

Un oedd yn y Pwyll.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.720
Oherwydd roedd gennym,

yn ymwneud yno i ddod i ni

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.120

Roedd yn y pwyll,

Roedd yn gallu ddweud llawer i'w.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.440
Yn oed.

A roedd yn credu bod nhw'n ddaeth yn ddaeth yn ddaeth?

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.440
Felly.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.760
Yr mwyaf rydw i'n gwybod yw £6 i'w brynu i'n hoffi.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.320
Felly, roedd yna gwybodaeth bach yn y 50au?

Roeddwn yn ddod fy mwyaf oedd.

Nid.

Nid, fy marn oedd yn ddiddorol.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.680
Roedd yn cael gynnydd i'r holl?

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.680

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.680
Roedd yna gwych oeddiadau,

a'u bod yn cael ei ddod yn am £13.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.680
Mae'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r hyn y byddwch chi'n ymwneud.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.680
Ond nid wyf yn cael gwych oeddiadau,

Roeddwn i'n gallu gwneud hynny'n dda o'r ddiddorol.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.680
A oedd yna unrhyw percs yn gweithio yn y ffattr?

Roedd yna gweithio'n teulu a'r gweithio'n gweithio,

oherwydd roeddwn i'n cael y badge gyda'r scissor.

A roeddwn i'n cael unrhyw percs.

Roedd nhw'n cael ei ddod yn y canthin,

i ddisgwyl beth oedd yn ymwneud yn ein percs.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.680
Felly,

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.680
fel ymwneud,

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.680

Ond roedd nhw wedi cael unrhyw percs.

A oedd yn rhaid i chi fod yn unrhyw percs?

A oedd hynny'n dda? Roedd yn dda i chi fod yn unrhyw percs?

Ie, oherwydd roedd nhw'n cael gwybodaeth o'ch amlwg,

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.680
Nid oedd yn llawer,

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.680
ond pan oedd yn ymwneud yn y canthin,

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.680
roedd yn rhaid i chi fynd yn unrhyw percs.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.680
Nid oedd gennych chi gwasanaeth, nid oedd gennych chi gwasanaeth.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.680
Ydych chi eisiau i ddod yn y canthin neu nid,

Yna byddai'n mynd i mewn i'r botn,

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.680
fel hynny, a'r llwybr yn ystod ystod y ffrwyd.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.680
A'r ffrwyd yn ystod ystod y ffrwyd.

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.680
O'r llwybr yn ystod y ffrwyd.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.680
A'r llwybr yn ystod y ffrwyd.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.680
Yn oed, roedd yn ystod y llwybr,

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.680
a'n gallu'n gwybod,

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.680
ond roeddwn i'n mynd i'r gwaith yn ystod y ffrwyd,

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.680
oherwydd roeddwn i'n gwybod,

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.680
yn y ddod i'r holl ffrwyd.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.680
A'r hyn yn ystod yno,

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.680
a'r gweithdwr yn ei bandaidd.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.680
A oedd o'r ffrwyd yn cael ddod i'r holl ffrwyd?

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.680
A oedd o'r ffrwyd yn cael ddod i'r holl ffrwyd?

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.680
Mae'n ddod i'r holl ffrwyd,

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.680
ond nid yw'r ddod i'r holl ffrwyd,

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.680
ond nid yw'r chym.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.680
Nid oedd y ffrwyd yn unig.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.680
Felly nid oedd rhyw rhai o?

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.680
Nid oedd rhyw rhai o.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.680
Nid oedd rhyw rhai o.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.680
Mae'n dda i'w ddod i,

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.680
ond mae'n dda i'n dda i ddod i,

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.680
mae'n dda i ddod i,

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.680
pan sylw i.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.680
Mae'n ddadlau'r neboedd ddiogel,

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.680
ond roedd hi'n gweithio yma hefyd, Pat.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.680
Rwy'n dda.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.680
Roedd hi'n gweithio yma hefyd?

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.680
A wnaf yn ddod i bryd?

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.100
os ydych chi eisiau cwpio tŷ.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.860
Nid, nid, dwi'n mynd i ddweud,

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.100
a oes gennych chi unrhyw rôl a'r regulatio?

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.600
A oes gennych chi rôl a'r regulatio,

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.900
gweithredu, hynny'n bwysig?

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.220
Nid.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.800
Nid.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.900
Yr unig peth yw,

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:28.940
yn ystod ymddygiad,

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.820
roedden nhw i chi wneud trimmings ar eich cyfnodau.

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.900
Roedden nhw'n trimmings, yn mynd,

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.980
galens, yn mynd ar y cyfnodau.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.580
Roedden nhw'n cwpio ymddygiad ar y cyfnodau.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.460
A roedden nhw'n cwpio i ddynu'r ddyddiau cyffredin

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.620
ar y cyfnodau cyffredin.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.820
Oherwydd, ar 1 o'r oed,

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.740
roedden nhw'n cwpio'r ffactorau i ddynu,

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.460
oherwydd, mae'n rhaid i'w gwybod,

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.100
yn bwysig fel.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.580
Ond roedden nhw'n gwybod hynny,

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.940
mae'r bosyr wedi'i ei gynnig,

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:58.100
roedden nhw'n gynnig, roedden nhw'n gynnig,

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.620
ac roedden nhw'n gynnig,

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.620
Roedden nhw'n gynnig,

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.660
yn y cyflwyno.

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.980
Ie.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:07.060
Mae'n rhaid i'w gynnig,

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.860
roedden nhw'n gynnig.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.300
Felly, pan oedd yn…

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.900
Pa amser o amser oedd yn gynnig?

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.340
O, ar ddwy o weithiau, yw'r…

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:17.860
Roedden nhw'n gynnig…

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:19.540
Y weithiau.

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:20.380
Roedden nhw'n gynnig…

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.660
Roedden nhw'n gynnig y ffactorau, yn oed?

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.100
Yn.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:23.660
Roedden nhw'n gynnig?

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:24.740
Ie.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.100
A beth o'r holladau arall?

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:27.860
Roedden nhw'n gynnig?

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.940
Ym, y minus.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.260
Yn y ddwy o weithiau o ddwy o weithiau,

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.380
a'r ddwy o weithiau o Ogast.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.140
Felly, y ffactorau…

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:35.900
Roedden nhw'n gynnig,

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.580
ar ddwy weithiau.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:42.300
A oedd hynny unrhyw holladau arall?

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.940
Nid oes rhaid i'w gynnig.

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:46.460
O, dwi'n meddwl,

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.700
ia, rydw i'n gynnig holladau arall.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.820
Oherwydd roedden nhw'n gynnig…

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.820
oherwydd roedden nhw'n gynnig,

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:53.620
ysgol,

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.140
roedden nhw ddim yn gynnig holladau arall.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.100
A pan oedd yn cael ei gynnig yn y ffactorau,

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.300
roedden nhw'n gynnig hynny.

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.660
O, dwi'n meddwl,

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.620
roedden ni wedi cael gynnyddol.

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:06.500
Ie.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:09.220
Do you remember…

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:12.260
What was the biggest dispute you remember?

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:15.660
The most exciting one then?

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.860
Well, when they shut the doors.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:19.820
I don't know.

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:24.580
I think because it was a dispute.

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.260
It was something simple it was,

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.340
and he'd had enough I think.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.260
Because if it was too cold,

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.900
you were allowed to leave.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.460
There was a degree,

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.500
and they'd have a look at the thermometer on the wall,

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.420
and if it went colder than that,

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.780
you were allowed to walk out.

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.340
And if it was too hot,

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.380
they'd open all the windows,

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.460
but then you could go out as well.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:58.620
You weren't allowed to work too hot or too cold.

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:03.140
But to go out on strike because the music won't come on,

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.780
I mean, he'd had enough I think,

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.460
and he'd just shut the gates.

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.660
And I think that we were all shocked.

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.220
We didn't think he'd do that.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.700
Because other times we've stayed in the canteen, look.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.340
But because we were going all down the road,

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.220
we wasn't going to have it and that,

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.220
and he'd just shut the gates.

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.980
So how did you get round that?

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.700
Well, we was all standing outside looking, God.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.500
But he had us back in.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.660
But I mean, we were doing silly things,

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:35.700
like it's, well, like one minute,

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.660
there was something going on in the toilet,

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.340
and I thought, what's all that?

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.060
Once the machines would go dead,

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.740
you'd think, oh, oh, what's that like?

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.380
And then you'd think, well, you know, all out, like,

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.180
and then you'd think, all out, everybody out,

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:52.340
and we'd go outside in the canteen and say,

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.340
well, what's up?

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.340
Well, something had gone on in the toilet

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.860
that the management didn't like.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.500
And then, you know, they'd go to the bottom of it,

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.620
and then we all piled back in then.

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.780
Then the machines start up again.

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.540
But it was a bit noisy with all the machines going,

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.300
all the time, mind.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.140
It was noisy.

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:13.980
Yes.

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.420
Did you have any protection?

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.260
No.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.100
No.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.940
Did it affect anybody's hearing, do you think?

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.380
No.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.340
I think it was just all these vroom, vroom,

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:26.420
sewing machine noises,

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.100
and it didn't take any notice,

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.340
because you'd be laughing and joking

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:33.420
with the girls around you.

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:37.180
You know, like you'd have one opposite your line there,

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:40.220
and, you know, you'd be talking to them.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.620
And you'd meet them every day

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:43.620
and see who, we went to Queens last night,

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.660
and we had a good time in the dance, you know?

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.620
Because in the 50s then,

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.820
you had all the rock and roll didn't you?

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.260
And we were rock and roll mad.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.100
And,

00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.060
it was a fabulous time.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.500
It was.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:06.500
Did you suffer any health consequences from working in it?

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:07.540
No.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.180
No.

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:11.820
No, my mother.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:15.020
My mother lived 86 when she died.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:16.340
My father had,

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.260
no, my father fell and had a broken femur.

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.140
But I mean, my father was elderly as well.

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:25.780
And he worked all the time.

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.540
He used to do all the pipes to the presses.

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.900
My father would strip the old presses

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:34.100
if they wanted to move them.

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.580
My father was there.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:38.980
Well, he was in work all the time, my father was.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.020
He was.

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.980
You said there was a canteen there.

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:44.860
Mm.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:45.780
Do you remember the food?

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:46.940
Was it good food?

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.260
Yeah.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.060
Yeah, it was reasonable as well.

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.540
It was pretty good.

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:55.660
Like you could go and have a dinner,

00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:57.500
or you could go in and have a sandwich,

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.100
or you know, and they had sweets.

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:04.180
You know, but yeah, it was all right.

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:06.820
Like, I always went home to dinner

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:10.260
because my pre-bab was only outside.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.100
But,

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:15.100
if in the mornings, if you wanted toast and tea,

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:18.140
because I can remember the toast being delicious,

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:22.140
because it would stop for a break in the morning,

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:24.020
say about 11 o'clock.

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:26.100
Well, then you'd go in for toast and tea.

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:30.140
And then, you know, say about 12, 1 o'clock.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.860
You'd actually dinner time, 12 till 1.

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:38.740
But no, they always had canteen staff.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:41.420
Yeah, lovely.

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:42.260
Good.

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.020
I'll stop it a minute.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.220
Ah, there we are.

00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.300
So, you've told me about the holidays,

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.140
that you had a week off for Christmas,

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.260
and a fortnight off.

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.580
Fortnight, minus.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:07.180
Yeah, and did you go anywhere on holiday?

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:08.020
Did you?

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:10.980
Yeah, we went, there was,

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:15.460
first time, four of us went to Southsea with the sailors.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:18.620
You know, that was a lovely holiday, that was in Southsea.

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.500
And the next time, there was six of us,

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:24.420
and we went to Southsea for a holiday.

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.980
And then, a couple of us in the factory,

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:29.420
they went down my mother's caravan.

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.620
We had a caravan in Swanbridge,

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.460
and a lot of the girls went down there with me.

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.460
You know, yeah,

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.180
but the Southsea holidays were great.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:42.020
Yeah.

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.220
Where's Southsea?

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.900
By Portsmouth.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.900
Oh, right.

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:48.100
With the sailors.

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.900
That was quite a long way to go.

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:50.860
Yeah.

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:54.700
We paid and paid for a couple of months.

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.140
All of us paid in the money,

00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:59.780
but the last time six of us went,

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:02.780
we were in two different boarding houses.

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.580
Right, why did you go there then?

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.580
After the sailors, I think.

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.580
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:14.580
So, you said you met your husband in Tredegar

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:17.580
in the dance hall.

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.580
Yeah.

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:20.580
Well, as I said, yeah,

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:24.580
I was 14 when I was going with him first,

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.580
and then I didn't see him.

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.580
He went to Newport Art College,

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.580
and then he came up to dance one night,

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:32.580
when he was about 22,

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.580
and then I seen him,

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.580
and we got together,

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:39.580
because he was an artist.

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.580
Oh, was he?

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:41.580
Mm.

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.580
Right.

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.580
Mm, like his son is.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.580
My youngest son is an artist as well.

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:48.580
Right.

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:49.580
Graphic design.

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.580
Oh, right, that's lovely, isn't it?

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.580
But no, he was lovely, Eric,

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.580
was he, he died.

00:54:56.580 --> 00:55:00.580
But yeah, we had a lovely white wedding,

00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:03.580
and a lot of the factory girls came.

00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:07.580
I had a big wedding, yeah.

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:11.580
Do you, did you miss, you know, when you left?

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.580
No, because we tried for a house,

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.580
and we had a house then,

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:21.580
and then I went in for a baby then, with Lee.

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:24.580
And you were happy to stay at home with a baby?

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:27.580
Oh, yeah, nobody wouldn't mind my children.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:31.580
My mother wouldn't give up her work to find my children,

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:36.580
because my mother worked all her life until she was 80.

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:37.580
Did she?

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:38.580
Yeah.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:39.580
And in the same factory?

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.580
No, she went to a different factory.

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:45.580
She went to LCR, the components.

00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:49.580
She even took a machine home with her in her 70s,

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:53.580
and she was doing it in the house.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.580
My mother liked her job, she wouldn't babysit.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.580
No.

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.580
My mother went to bingo every night,

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:03.580
but she, no, my mother wasn't, she wouldn't.

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:06.580
If you said, will you have the children for us to go out?

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:09.580
No, she wouldn't.

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:13.580
So I was well with the boys, like Lee's 46,

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:17.580
and, but she wouldn't mind them.

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.580
They didn't in them days, though.

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:23.580
My mother wouldn't give up her life to stay in for my,

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.580
no, you had them, you look after them.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.580
Independent women.

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:29.580
Yeah.

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:31.580
There we are.

00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:36.580
Are you in contact with your former workmates?

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:38.580
All time.

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:40.580
And you've stayed in contact over the years?

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:42.580
All the time.

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.580
Even the ones living in Romney, Markham,

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:50.580
I've got friends, Rose, who worked in Markham on the double line.

00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:54.580
No, Denix Girls have stuck together.

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:59.580
We had a reunion now in, we had a reunion,

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:03.580
what was I saying, in September.

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:05.580
Oh, you had a reunion this year?

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:06.580
Yeah, yeah.

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.580
About 45 come.

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:10.580
And where did you go?

00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:13.580
In the local moose hall.

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.580
And what did you do?

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:19.580
Well, we had, Paul was there and he was playing the music,

00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:23.580
and we had drinks and all, and we all just cutched one another.

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:27.580
Because I swear, it's like when we meet the Denix Girls,

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.580
we go, yeah, how's it going?

00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:32.580
And they're all married with families now.

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:35.580
And they'd go, well, she was still going.

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:40.580
And everybody feels that, not just me and my friends.

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.580
They all feel that.

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:45.580
Do you miss the camaraderie now?

00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:52.580
Yeah, the other week I put a photo of the Denix Girls in the paper,

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:55.580
in the Gwent Gazette, and they published it, like,

00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:59.580
and it was awful chuff because they'd seen it in the Gwent Gazette.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:02.580
That was about a month ago, I went in there.

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:03.580
Yeah.

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:07.580
Great. And you said you've got a couple of photos here.

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:09.580
You arranged a big reunion, did you?

00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.580
Yeah, that was up in the island side, in Kevengola, that was.

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:17.580
My mother was alive then, and my,

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:22.580
because Edward was only a little boy, and he's,

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:28.580
Edward was about one, I think, and he's 33 now.

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:31.580
So, but that was a big one.

00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:36.580
And because there's supervisors on you, like men,

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:41.580
who was on the cutting room, and supervisors, I would, he died.

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:44.580
But there's a lot who've passed away.

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:49.580
A-dip-a-there, she died on the disco.

00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:52.580
There's an awful lot.

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:55.580
But that was fabulous, it was.

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:58.580
And how many of you got together then?

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:03.580
Oh, there was about 200 there. Yeah.

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.580
When did the factory finally shut?

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:10.580
I don't know the date.

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:14.580
No. But you'd long left, yeah?

00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:21.580
Yeah, my mother and father was working there a couple of years after I left, my father, you know.

00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:26.580
But do you remember, it was the 60s, 70s, 80s?

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.580
I was in the late 70s.

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.580
Late 70s, yeah.

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:36.580
Looking back, how do you feel about the time you spent working in the factory?

00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:46.580
Well, I don't think, I don't know if they got that closeness today in factories, I don't know,

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.580
because I don't know anything about factories now.

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:56.580
But being said it's the only factory in the town, and everybody left school and went there.

00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:03.580
If they stayed six weeks, if they stayed two months, like some would say, oh I was only there six months.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:12.580
But that's where you went. When you left school, everybody went there, because that was the main employer in the town.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:18.580
Besides, they had the LCR, but they had Nutt & Boat.

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:25.580
That was another factory, Nutt & Boat, but that was like car parts and that.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:31.580
And the Crown Cork, that was another factory, but that was all like bottle tops.

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:35.580
You know, that wasn't a sewing industry.

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:43.580
But no, that was the main place, you know.

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.580
And you enjoyed it?

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:48.580
Well, it was the best working life.

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:53.580
I think I would have stayed there until the end if I hadn't had my children.

01:00:54.580 --> 01:01:03.580
Because even my friend now, Sylvie, she keeps saying, oh if we could go back to them days again.

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.580
Pity we couldn't have it now and go there now.

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:14.580
But the memories that you have, and we laugh over things that happened.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:19.580
Like that girl still alive, Marlene, had a blood blocked jaw.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:28.580
The girl nearly died because she threw the cotton wheel, and it was a big cotton wheel in her, and it hit her on the jaw.

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:32.580
Well, the factory had all the machines shut off.

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:39.580
And one time, Marlene Elbert, she passed away now, she lived in Ayriford.

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:43.580
And she wrote, I love Elvis, down the trouser leg.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.580
So all the machines went off now.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.580
So we said, what's the matter, what's the matter?

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:53.580
Well, if you don't own her, you'll all be sacked off the line.

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:57.580
Well, she was Elvis mad.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:01.580
Elvis, she was crackers, she had all Elvis all over her machine.

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:06.580
And she said to the supervisor, she said it was me.

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:08.580
She said it was me.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.580
She said it was me.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:17.580
And she had to go up the office, and I think she had to pay for the trouser.

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:21.580
But it was only chalk, I love Elvis, all the way down the leg.

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.580
She wasn't sacked then?

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:28.580
No. She had a warning, and they said that you mustn't do things like that.

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:30.580
But they didn't sack her.

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.580
Great.

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.580
That was great. Thank you very much.

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.580
Thank you.

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.580
Yeah.
