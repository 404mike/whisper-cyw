00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Cwm Parc Tales

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Dai the ram

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Dai was not a person of some form of sexual prediction,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but a four-legged fleeced horned animal that belonged to Dan Prince

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
whose farm was below the park colliery Cwm Parc.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Dai lived on the park top picktop,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
not a blade of grass in sight,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but Dai lived off what the boys had empty from their tummy boxes as they came up to the picktop.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Dai was quite a distinguished animal,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
who would on occasion sit on his lap rump like a dog.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
His friss was changed from where he stayed near the brazier.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The brazier fire kept to keep picktop workers' hands warm

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
when they were handling chains and clamps and things like that from cold rams.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
To make sure Dai was not harmed in the night,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the men had painted his homes neumonous white so they knew where Dai was.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Dai was king of the picktop, big, strong.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
When the pit closed, what happened to Dai?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Did Dai go back to farm life? Who knows?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That's another story.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The name of the ramps, that gives the meaning to of rampage.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The translator

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
When the collieries closed, some men went to work in the EMI factory in Triochi.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
EMI made radios and telephones, etc.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
One of the main supporters, importers, was Germany.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Sometimes when they had a problem, they would phone Triochi.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The factory phoned the school, request for German speakers.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
No luck. French? Yes. Spanish? Yes.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Welsh? Yes. English? Yes.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Latin? Yes. German? No.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The factory asked a ride for anyone who spoke German.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000
One of the workers called Ivan for convenience, said he had served in Germany for years just after the war.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Anyway, once more Germany phoned the factory to say they had a problem.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So the factory sent to the factory floor to get Ivan to the offices.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
They all waited rather pleased that they had a local with German phrases.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Ivan picked up the phone and said in a loud voice,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
What do you want?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Pit ponies

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Pit ponies lived underground 24 hours a day, 70s a week, 50 weeks of the year.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Their hostlers changed with every shift, but the ponies stayed underground.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Except when the mines were on holidays, two weeks each summer,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
their hostlers brought them down to the fields around the Götze stones on the main day.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000
By golly, when they were left into the field, they ran and jumped and kneed and chased one another.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Such horse happiness!

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If it were a beautiful summer, the hostlers had a heck of a job to get them back in to go to work.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But if it had been a wet, wet summer, they gave up gladly.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Fflaen a thais yn rôl, pryd o roedd y pwll tlaid glo cael ei gilyddau,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
roedd y bwys cwmp arc wedi'i gwneud pwll dôr o flaen y pwll glo park.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Roedd pawb yn galw y pwrst dôr, the dam.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Roedd y dam yn atherchog i wneud i o'n nofio yn y dôr.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Am beth waith roedd y mraw John a fi mynd lan i'r dam i'n nofio gyda'r bechgen eraill.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Pan oeddwn yn dod yn ôl at y te, roedd mam yn ddweud,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
a'i ddwy bachgen Cymraeg mynd lan i'r dam i'n nofio,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.000
ond roedd dwy bachgen o China wedi dod yn ôl, roedd y gwas ac roedd John a fi sawl o mud meiling y dam.
