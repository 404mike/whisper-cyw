00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Winter's Night, a quarter to one, The shampan's exhausted, the days were gone,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The fire was low, the night begun, The easterly wind blew stronger.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Winter's Night, a quarter to two, The embers were pulled and the party went clear,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The shampan's lay there covered in dew, It will they sing until morning.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Winter's Night, a quarter to three, The sky was filled with black mystery,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Lights shone on the company, And all around ages were singing,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Oh, the unity chimes as ever, And death as the worldly wonder of the yards.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Winter's Night, a quarter to four, The shampan's pushed the silver wall,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
In the manger, hiding the snow, Surrounded by lovers, the crying sky.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Winter's Night, a quarter to five, There was just the living sight,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The son of God, who lay and smiled.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The tears of wood, as tears from the frost, That elm tree remembered the snow,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The angels had sung that night.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Oh, the unity chimes as ever, And death as the worldly wonder of the yards.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Christmas Night, a quarter to five, The shampan's looked in until the alarm,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Oh, they stood a springy night, But above the ground, the lights shone.
