00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
The man with the cool face is the man that is doing, digging the coal.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.800
So the more men they could get with the cool face and the less men they could get doing their work,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.800
the more profitable it was.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.800
He not understood.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.800
Everybody accepts that.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.800
But the further in it was going, it meant more timber, piece of cartof.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.800
Puts another engine to pull up.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.800
The man didn't have an engine like myself.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.800
I wasn't doing anything to create the coal.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.800
It was all in the coal.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.800
It had come from the man that was digging it.
