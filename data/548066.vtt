This poem naprawdÄ™ Leben Chung.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I moon, all young, severed my heart,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I run when your feet stumble,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Tear and wet their grail,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
On an inch I grail,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
On a lowly well.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:24.000
We honor our great God is my name,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
When I have severed my wrath on him,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
All will the cross and mercy go by,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
To a certain day the well will be mine.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Joyful, joyful, I am around your dream,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
How I am on joy and on calm in me,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Do I think I will ever bring,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.000
For when I stumble and so long fear sin.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Joyful, joyful, I am around your dream,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
How I am on joy and on calm in me,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Do I think I will ever bring,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
For when I stumble and so long fear sin.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
When I have severed my wrath on him,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
All will the cross and mercy go by,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
To a certain day the well will be mine.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:31.000
In a guiding fire at your side,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The empty path unbound,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
On a burning, treading face,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I'll be back not with no more doubt,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
We fill the morn of the day

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
To a roaring new God,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
To a roaring new God,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
To a roaring new God,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
How I am on joy and on calm in me,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Do I think I will ever bring,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
For when I stumble and so long fear sin.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
In a guiding fire at your side,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
The loose and tender people,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The rotten, trigger-posed,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Will sing a lullaby to the Lord,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Whose power forever light,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
A better person missing,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
A blessing and a fire.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Come, you crystal-bent and rare,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
A deadly dreadless story,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Coming near God, bring love,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And my God is mercy.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
You'll join them like a good ride,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And be in serenity,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Or be with the red-red thunders,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Or let them hear,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The golden blue-red sorrows,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Of peace on the red-gar,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The blue-red and white thunders,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The army of the mire.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Come, you crystal-bent and rare,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
A deadly dreadless story,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Coming near God, bring love,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And my God is mercy.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Come, you crystal-bent and rare,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
A deadly dreadless story,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Coming near God, bring love,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And my God is mercy.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Thanks for watching!
