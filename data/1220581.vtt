00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Can you tell me a little bit more about where your father was working in a shop which was owned by his brother-in-law?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Yes, his brother-in-law owned it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Can you tell me more about the shop?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It was a drapery shop.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You did in the shop?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It was four units in one and during the war it was terribly busy.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The coupons, the shop, the coupons and all that.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And did a bit of pawnbroking, sawed a bit of jewelry as well, footwear.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And he had three girls working there permanently, besides my father.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And near Christmas it was like a football ground.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I used to run the till when I used to go down to help.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We used to have, I don't know if I can explain you, at the far end of the shop, they used to put the money into a container.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And they used to come on a wire.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Like a woodshare?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Yeah. And there were three of those, which all led to the office.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And in those days, many, many people in the valleys took out credit coupons, vouchers they call them.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
For example, you could borrow 20 pounds, okay, and you'd have this.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So you could now buy 20 pounds with the goods.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But you'd repay, the customer now would have to repay the people, say, a pound a week for 25 weeks.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
That's how everyone made money out of it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So when people bought with those vouchers, they'd have to fill it all in and there were damn nuisance.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But there were a lot of turnover.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And we as a shopkeeper had to pay a commission too, onto these.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
There was Premier, there were about three different companies doing that work.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And what happened is they defaulted?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Oh, that was none of our business.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
That was no problem.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We got the money back from the credit people.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So you stepped over a little bit, pawnbroking.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Well, it was a joke.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But really, I don't know how I can describe it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It was a mining community, right?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Yeah.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Miners earn very, very little.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So we had customers where the woman would come in on a Monday,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
where her husband had worn his best suit for church on Sunday,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and we'd give her two shillings.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And when he got paid on Friday, she'd come back in and pay us two and three,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
two shillings and throppens, to get the suit out for the husband.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And then Monday would come back in again.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Well, that was life in those days.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Sounds a joke now, but that was life.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
That's a side of things that some people don't like talking about,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
but was your family happy to talk about that?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Oh, I've got an eye.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I was only a small percentage of people doing it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Yeah.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
But...

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Is that equivalent to a payday loan now?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Yeah, well, it's the same thing.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
People still get credit, and you pay commission on credit.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Everybody makes money, except the poor chap who buys the credit.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
OK.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
What happened to the shop in the end?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Well, business got slower and slower.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I was letting my father be packed up.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
My uncle died the same year, so his wife owned it.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And then a member of...

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Where did my son come from?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Well, his son-in-law came and took over.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But business got slower and slower, and they eventually closed it down.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I don't know what year. 1980-odd.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And this was in Penrugklaiba?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Penrugklaiba, yeah.
