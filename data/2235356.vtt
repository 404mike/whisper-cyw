This is Julie Lawrence and I am interviewing Sue Birch, one of the volunteers at

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.160
Frenzive Cardiff Reservoirs about her involvement with the Reservoirs.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.880
My earliest memories of the Reservoir is when my family learnt to sail there

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:23.680
between the late 19th and early 90s. My husband learnt to sail first and continued

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.320
to volunteer and Wednesday evening classes for the youngsters for many years. Get in the

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.720
boats ready and helping taking the youngsters out on the water.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.240
So have you got any particularly special memories of events that happened while you were attending

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.360
the Reservoir and your husband was volunteering helping children learn to sail?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.440
When the legato was on I won the things I remember is my middle daughter, capsizing just after

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.960
they'd set off and my husband had to go and help rescuer. I remember all the little

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.800
frogglets that used to be on the ropes that kept the boats mored to the pontoon and just

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.840
generally wandering around the Reservoir and observing the wildlife while the children

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.560
were out sailing. When I learnt to sail myself at the end of the course you had to do a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.800
capsize and I did my capsize drill, I was quite petrified. I came up underneath the sail

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.280
which was most disconcerting. The worst thing of all was when I actually got back up and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:41.000
in the boat I had lost one of my shoes. I remember it was a yellow white striped marks

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.520
and spencers canvas shoe which I assume is still lying at the bottom of the Reservoir

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.760
somewhere. How do you think coming to the Reservoir

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.240
affected you as a family? I think we find it as a, apart from the actual

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.200
form of learning to sail, the atmosphere was great, you could wander around in between

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.960
and it was tranquil and it's always stuck with me. When you look at the Reservoirs as they

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.000
are today what does that mean to you now? It brings down lots of family memories, but

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.120
when we all used to be here it's amazing to see it now as it is with the ability to

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.960
walk around it, having to get a licence. Just to see how much is improved and how much

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:34.640
the people are now going to learn to sail into water sports here. What wonderful facilities

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:43.560
they have. You've become a volunteer yourself. What have you enjoyed about that? I've enjoyed

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.200
trolling around the Reservoir, watching the wildlife as I go around chatting to people,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.160
some of the activities that's been done such as well as in the word with the Simon Seeker

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.160
families has been really, really worthwhile and I think I will enjoy all the ongoing activities

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.160
that are there that keep me coming around the Reservoir. Once the Reservoir closed to people

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:15.640
sailing, did your families continue to sail? Or what did you do? My childhood didn't,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.680
but my husband had a boat in Mandagvier than we sailed a couple of times up there.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.880
Now that it's open again for water sports do you think that you might participate in that

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.120
in the future? Yes, I probably will. My husband certainly will, I'll go with sailing and I know that

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.400
one of my daughters wants to come up here to go paddle boarding and probably my grandchildren as well.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.800
Oh that would be lovely to have three generations. I promise.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.360
Is there anything else that you'd like to tell us about your involvement with the Reservoir?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.000
Well when my family visit from Manchester and Reading, grandchildren and my daughters

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.400
always come for walk around the Reservoir, it's one of their destinations when they come to Cardiff

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.480
to visit. No, absolutely. Can you tell me anything about some of the wildlife that you've seen at the

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.440
Reservoir? Well there's plenty of defted ducks and little greaves, loads of nodes and little greaves,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.360
but in the summer I was doing a patrol here once and there were big flock of swifts that came

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.240
back and forth circulating and then disappeared. That's the first time I've seen a flock of swifts

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.360
and it was quite amazing. Have you ever spotted anything that's particularly excited or surprised you?

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.040
Do you have any memories of nature being at the Reservoir while the sailing was going on?

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.240
There used to be a larger number of geese and one of the tasks of the volunteers was to clean all

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.240
the goose-strottings off the boats before the kids could take them out.
