say.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
of the world.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
From angels gently near the earth,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to touch their hearts of gold.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Peace on the earth, good will to men,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the friends of gracious He.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The world in solemn stillness play,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
you hear the angels sing.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Still through the golden skies they come,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
with little wings of pearl.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And still their heavenly music flows,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
for all the weary world.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
For the eternal glory plays,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in heaven the glory queen.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And ever more its fervent sounds,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.000
the blessed angels sing.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
For the heavens and near the earth,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
all the world is filled with its music.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000
The earth is filled with the music,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
the world is filled with the music.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
For the heavens and near the earth,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
all the world is filled with the music.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
For the heavens and near the earth,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
all the world is filled with the music.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
For the heavens and near the earth,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
all the world is filled with the music.
