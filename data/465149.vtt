00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We saw the development and expansion of Harlech television initially and then ITV Wales stuttering

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:22.520
and spluttering its way into the television sphere and then the battle and fight to get

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:37.520
the S4C off the ground and unfortunately the slow development of the overall availability of television

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:47.520
for the whole of Wales. Initially in South Wales people in Devon and Cornwall used to complain because they could pick up

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.520
Harlech television being from Wenbow and the people in Carly were picking up Devon and Cornwall televisions

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:07.520
because of the scale and strength of the transmitters up here. It was a long time before we got any BBC Wales

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:23.520
and most of our stuff came as I said before from Sutton Coalfield and Winter Hill and then they started to put booster stations

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:36.520
in various places which amplified the broadcasting of the BBC Wales programmes and it's only recently that due to

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:46.520
digitalisation that I can get BBC Two Wales, get all the other programmes depending on which way your airing is positioned.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:59.520
It's been quite an experience. I can remember as a child going to the cinema on a Saturday and watching these black and white movies

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:08.520
with cowboys and Indians and all sorts of things and saying to Nugin, oh boy wouldn't it be lovely if we had a picture like that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:20.520
and we could watch it at home and I can remember a friend of mine, we had a garden shed and he had one of these little small cinema projectors

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:29.520
and he used to have about a three minute reel film or Felix the Cat and some of the early Mickey Mouse things

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:40.520
and he used to charge a penny to come into the shed to watch these and now you go home and I remember the first time that I saw one of these

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:50.520
42 inch television screens was only a couple of years ago, I was coming home from the pub, going past the house, I saw this man and a woman

00:02:50.520 --> 00:03:03.520
and they were dancing around in the front room and it looked like a tennis racket in their hands and I saw a glimpse of this huge 42 inch screen on the wall

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:18.520
and they were actually playing tennis to the television, I don't know what it's called, I haven't got one but the latest innovation now is to be

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:27.520
almost reality television isn't it, being a part of what is going on in the screen.
