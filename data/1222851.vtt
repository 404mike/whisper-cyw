00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
But your grandparents must have been successful people.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.420
Yes.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.800
Successful business people.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.560
Yeah, oh yeah.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.220
So you had a privileged upbringing amongst Jewish people.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.760
A nice upbringing.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.260
Yeah.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:27.820
I wouldn't say privileged because I mean there were plenty of quite wealthy Jewish people at that time.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.740
I mean you know the sort of families that...

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.660
You take the raports, they used to be the...

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.060
The Rivlins?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.740
The Rivlins to some degree.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.140
Who's the other fella?

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.620
Who lived in Cathedral Road?

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.380
Had roaf...

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.540
Roaf furnishing.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.980
Roaf furnishing.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.480
Yeah.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.300
Flegelstone.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.260
Flegelstone.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.380
I can remember all the sticks in my mind.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.460
Mr. Flegelstone was high and mighty.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.960
Yeah.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.820
Quite high and mighty.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.860
And it was like supposed to be a privilege to talk to him if you like.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.060
Yeah, been there.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.860
Anyway, they had roaf furnishing.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.860
I a little later bought a property in City Road right next to him.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.020
And I can remember him coming up to me and saying,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.380
David, I wonder if you could do me a favour?

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.100
I said, well what's that?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.420
He said, I've got nowhere to park my car.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.440
Right.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.980
And you've got the huge car park.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.180
Would you allow me to park in your car park?

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.180
And I said, I wonder if you would have asked me that 30 years ago.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.060
But he did.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.620
And I became quite friendly with him because you're in business

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.860
and suddenly you're in a reasonably good way.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.700
And suddenly there's much more respect for you.
