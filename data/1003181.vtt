WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
I see that Jerry Journey is heading up here already to tell us something about remembering

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.120
Seattlean poetry and also Jennifer Nightingale is going to get help too.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:24.680
Say, how do you do?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.760
It's a great honor to be here.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.280
I was supposed to be a bar.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.600
This was supposed to be Calling of the Bards, at which my name was not supposed to be in

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.600
here.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.960
I'm very flattered that it was though because I'm always referred to as Bron Journey's

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.200
dad or Betty Pritchard's dad sometimes, but Betty Pritchard's husband most of the time,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.600
but I have been accused of being her father.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.240
Two reasons, she's got hair and I haven't and hers is not gray and mine is.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.120
But at any rate, that was my attempt at being humorous.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.160
I should let Bron tell the jokes, but by your laughter you must be Presbyterians who don't

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.800
really think very much is funny or you could be Baptists who don't think anything is funny.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.080
But at least the General Assembly of regular Baptists, Methodists however, they politely

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.000
laugh even if they don't think it's funny and Baptists don't laugh even if they think

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.440
I'm getting so deep in here and my wife said, do not bring up anything controversial.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.440
So I better go.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.400
Now, what I'm going to do, Mrs. or Ms. or Jackie Cederholm has given me an allocation

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:47.200
of five minutes to not say my poem necessarily, but my wife has spent three weeks, well she

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.560
spent three days in historical events around the Old Wells Church.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.440
The three weeks has been spent in my typing it.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:05.920
So I think I would like to read what she wrote and then maybe I can get your assistance because

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.840
I don't think I can do this in five minutes.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.840
So to keep me from watching my watch, would you please watch your watches and when five

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.960
minutes are up, get up and tell Mrs. Cederholm and she will jump up and say, kajda gegg,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.600
which means in Welsh, please be quiet or a more literal translation would be shut up

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.360
and sit down and that's what I'll do and then I'll steal away and we can forget that poem.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.600
But if I can, anyway, I've used the five minutes on this preamble.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.560
So at any rate, my wife wrote this and she was in the Welsh Church for 25 years of her

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.760
first 25 years of her life and this is her memories.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.600
It's titled Memories of the Welsh in Seattle.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.560
I am not a public speaker and she thinks I am.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.920
So take three seconds.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.240
I am not a public speaker but my husband agreed to deliver this talk if I would jot down some

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.320
of my fond memories of the Welsh times.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.160
Once I heard a friend give a talk and she too was uncomfortable speaking publicly and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.400
she used the alphabet as a guide.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.960
It worked for her so I will do the same using as many letters as time will permit.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.760
A stands for Anwyl, which is a word of endearment.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.200
I like the definition beloved because 10th and East John was the home of the Welsh Presbyterian

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.320
Church, a beloved place to many Welsh that came from near and far.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.440
B is for Bible because the small band of people truly believed in the word of God and their

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.680
faith took them through the many hardships that occurred in that time in history.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.920
C is for Cymru or Cymraeg.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.280
They spoke Welsh, they prayed in Welsh, they preached in Welsh, sang in Welsh and they

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.920
settled here because the climate and countryside reminded them of their home in Welsh called

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.440
Cartref.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.880
C also stands for Celebrity.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.640
We had our share of those.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.080
Frances Williams, with the help of her Welsh Church family, went to New York City to become

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.440
an arranger and composer for the Harold Flammer Music Publishing Company.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.520
The tutor, known as Ted Jones, is a nationally acclaimed hydroplane designer and driver and

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.200
is still involved in his field.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.960
Arthur and Jane Davis pursued a successful career in the singing and acting on the stage

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.480
of theaters and opera in New York City.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.520
Betty Lee Watson became a champion swimmer and she was trained by Ray Daughters, one

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.440
of the great swimming coaches in the United States of America.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.200
She even got in contests, swimming contests with Helene Madison and Beter on several occasions

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:58.080
and she was the greatest women swimmer in that era in the United States.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.720
So anyway, that was the celebrities that came from that little church, which the whole church

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.840
was about one half the size of this.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.400
D reminds me of Mrs. George Davies, who lived in the Antique Chapel, which means church

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.560
along with her daughter, Gwen, and Emlyn, her son.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.200
Mrs. Davies made real Welsh tea, hot and flavorful.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200
I can attest to that.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.800
Boy, was that good tea.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.720
E stands for eglois, which means church.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.920
This place was the center of their spiritual and social life.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.360
My Sunday school class met in the first two rows of the sanctuary and Mrs. T.C. Williams

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.720
was our teacher.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.260
Other classes were held in the sanctuary as well as the entire church.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.640
We had prayer meetings, choir practice, as well as Gmanbaganys and the first of marches,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.100
as this is, St. David's Day celebrations, unsurpassed anywhere, plus church dinners

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:59.100
and small and great istead beds, where my mom's barabrith almost always took first prize.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:09.660
F stands for fighenu, which means disguised or barred name.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.900
That's what I'm supposed to be, a bard.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:20.980
But this poem, compared to these great bards, is pretty much like my poem compared to Longfellow's.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.460
These people were very excellent.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.700
At any rate, not that I could understand them, they were all in Welsh.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.960
The bards sent their poverty from afar, such as Olin Hughes.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.900
Bard name was Glasgowite from Vancouver, B.C.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:42.340
Richard Morris, Kyriag bard name, from Seldovia, Alaska, and our version, our very own bard,

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.180
T. Charles Williams.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.740
This poetry was an important part of the first of march celebrations.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.600
G stands for Gmanbaganys.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.260
You cannot imagine the singing in that acoustically perfect church.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.540
There were numerous conductors from which to choose, some of which were Owen J. Williams,

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:07.420
Annie Jones Hughes, Hugh Morris Jones, David Pritchard, William Park Pritchard, and others.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.460
H stands for Hwyl.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.820
The Gmanbaganys were spirit-filled, as well as the Sunday services, and the Hwyl prevailed

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.700
as they sang their hymns.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.740
I stands for I cherish the memory of the people in that church.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.060
The young people addressed the elders as auntie or uncle, in other words, auntie Hughes or

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.900
uncle Williams, and the elders addressed each other as mister and missus, regardless of

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:37.540
how long they'd known each other.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.020
J stands for Jones, Jenkins, and James.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.020
There were many of each.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.140
They had to be identified by descriptive adjectives.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.820
Jones, a pintur, that's painter, and Jones, a Kent.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.260
K, speaking of Kent, reminds me of Tide and Nine's farm, where so many well-social events

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.260
were held.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.900
Tide and Nine means grandfather and grandmother, respectively.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.140
L stands for looking forward to so many summer picnics.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.940
One was at Alki, all of us boarding the streetcar with our baskets and riding the trestle with

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.860
the old streetcar swaying from side to side.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.020
This ride was not for the squeamish or the weak of stomach.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.740
We frequented the bathhouse, long since torn down, and displayed our locker key pinned

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.060
to the strap of our bathing suits as we strolled the promenade.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.900
The next picnic was held at Cowl Lake, now known as Lake Meridian.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:35.540
This required us boarding a truck, which also swayed, and singing our way to and from the

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.540
lake.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.860
The big picnic was the Labor Day picnic, convening at stove number three at Woodland Park, the

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.140
day after the Gamond Vagani.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.460
Singing at these picnics was something like, you've never heard and will never hear again.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.660
The younger set would frequently be embarrassed at the parents' antics and head up the hill

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:58.780
to visit the monkeys.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.900
M stands for Moita, the love we had for one another.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.420
This little band of hardy folk sustained their grief in hard times because of their love

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.100
for one another.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.360
N stands for Nostalch, good night.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.220
After evening and morning services, we'd all shout Nostalch, hugging and kissing each other

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.420
until the next time we met.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:27.060
O stands for Organist, which included Diana Jones, Annie Jones Hughes, Frances Williams,

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.620
Edwin Williams, and yours truly.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.420
Ed would frequently add a little culture by playing blue-green gas, the theme song of

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.700
the Joe Penner radio program aired on Saturday nights.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:44.740
This would be rendered in the organ's treble register while playing the offeratory, and

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:53.060
all Ed's mom would say was, Oh Edwin!

00:09:53.060 --> 00:10:03.300
P stands for Preacher, John Reese Evans, J. Michael Hughes, Reverend Josiah Daniels, Reverend

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:12.740
John Reese Williams, and also Dr. John R. Johns, who is preached in this church.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.860
P is also for pews.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.380
Each family had their own pew, and we were fortunate to sit across the aisle from Griffith

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.180
Swords' family.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:26.060
Fortunate because during and after the service, they would slip me a Welsh mint, a candy I've

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.300
never been able to find again, neither here nor in Canada.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.060
They were really good.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.860
Q stands for Quartet.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.940
They had some of the finest voices in all registers.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.500
Any type of ensemble could be organized.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:45.460
Mainly, the voices were untrained, but who needs training with that kind of natural ability?

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.340
R stands for reminiscing.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.620
My first 25 years were spent in this church, and then the church was closed.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.940
I'm sure there are many times in advance I've forgotten, and many events happened before

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.100
my time.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.740
If anyone would like to say a word about those days, please do so.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.740
Is that okay, Jack?

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.180
I know, but where is Jack?

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.180
She's the one there.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.420
Oh yeah, is that okay if somebody gets up and takes my time?

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.020
More than five minutes, I already take it.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.740
Okay, anyone want to, well I won't.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.740
You do that, okay?

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.500
I have a tough time with the alphabet.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.140
Anyway, I better keep going.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.740
S stands for sociability.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:33.180
Gamundas, tees, esthedvits, concerts, and conversations abounded in this group.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:42.220
T stands for time is running out, so I will dispense with the rest of the alphabet.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.580
Whoever heard of Welsh words starting with V, X, and Z anyway?

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:52.660
U, W, and Y are used by all of us, us, you, and we.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.140
All of us should be grateful for this small band of Welsh who came to this strange land

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.780
and made a life for themselves and a heritage for us.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.940
Pride in our Welsh.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.460
That's the end of my wife's write-up.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:17.980
Now you're free to leave now because now comes my poem.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:23.100
And it also is entitled, Reminiscing.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.100
So here goes.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.900
This is supposed to be good, but it isn't.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.100
I'm not a real Welshman from birth and baby carriage, but when I went a Welsh girl, I'm

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.220
a Welshman now by marriage.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.740
I've learned about the early Welsh, so you can learn it too.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.340
As every year unfolds itself, I'll share it all with you.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.420
Life for the Welsh was in their church.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.940
Location, 10th and John.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.900
If you heard a Welshman say it, it sounds like 10th and Sean.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.500
Morgans, Jeffries, Owens, Jones, Evans, Davies, Hughes.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.300
Richard Williams were typical of names that fill the pews.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.100
Cars were few, so most all walked.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:07.740
For many blocks they came, gathered in their beloved church to praise his holy name.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.020
When the pragerther stood to preach, his voice would rise and fall.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.340
When I heard his messages, I understood no word at all.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.500
When the congregation prayed to God, I remember Mr. Hughes.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.820
He would turn and kneel down and pray upon the pews.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.860
The weekend of our Labor Day, the Gamon Begani's here.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.260
The Welsh all got together and sang those hymns so dear.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.860
Their voices rang to heaven.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.660
Forgotten was their toil.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.660
After verses 1 and 2, they all got in the hwyl.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.900
Then it wouldn't park on Monday, a picnic all day long.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.060
With that many Welshmen, they were bound to sing a song.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.620
The passersby would stand and stare, and to the songs they'd hark.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.620
They started singing early and didn't end till after dark.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:58.380
When they had a social in the church's social hall, they came for many miles around, Welshmen

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.560
one and all.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.320
The food they brought was heavenly.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.460
It cannot be pronounced.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:09.220
Served at Nosanlawan as Pragerther had announced, there was barabrith and barakerch and also

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:14.900
barasein, teybach and wheels of cows for all the Welsh to dine.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:20.080
And then at private parties with teybach and barabrith, they'd laugh and dare each other

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.320
to sing without their teeth.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.320
They would.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.200
I've been to those parties.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.480
The Welsh are kind of stubborn, though I hate to say it here.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.600
If you want some proof of this, let me know your ear.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.160
Pronouncing towns is simple.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.440
The Welsh swear this is so.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.560
If you believe that, then try to say, llan bar ffuskin gwyth go geryth, when rywbos

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:51.000
go, go, go.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.440
They're a little superstitious.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.280
To this they won't admit.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.760
Hat on a bed, black cat, or wearing green, will throw them in a fit.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.640
Those glory years have passed.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.640
They're prime.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.600
Those years are gone, I fear.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.360
As an inferior substitute, it's guys like me you hear.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.800
Those golden years are past and to me seem but a myth.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.480
In the hearts of all those Welsh, rings clearly, comry a byth.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.480
Thank you very much.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.480
Thank you.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.480
Thank you very much.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.480
Thank you.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.480
Thank you very much.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.480
Thank you.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.480
Thank you very much for your work.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.480
Jennifer?

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.480
Oh, there you are.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.480
Oh, there you are.
