00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I had the record for a man and boy that's in the 14th wall.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I had nearly 15 ton of large coal for a man and boy.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
A record of the pit.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
At the magnificent sum of 1.7 safety a ton.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What do you think of that? 1.7 safety.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
A ton of coal.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And it's a very gassy scene.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I had a couple of gas from my lamp up in the gauze.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You see that would be about 2 inches or 2.5.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Really, if there had been good ventilation, it would have been really dangerous.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We couldn't have worked there.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But I was working in that, where the gas was up in the gauze.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And one day it was awful. We couldn't keep light hardly.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Our lights were down just on the top of the pipe of the lamp.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So I said to the other men, I said, look here, they complained to me.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I was working in the main opening work.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And they called me and they complained they couldn't see much.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So I went and looked for the bosses.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
They were always down the pit.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And I saw them.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But when they seen me come in, they would come to meet me.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
What's the matter? They thought accident.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I said, oh no, no accident.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But I said, you want to come down and examine our place?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We can't work there. It's full of gas.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Well, I knew how to test for a gas slug.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The others didn't.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And the men used to shout to me, what is it looking like today in the island?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Well, I'd make a test and I'd tell them.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You see, I knew the job.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So the official, I told him that there was a lot of gas there and we couldn't keep light.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Our light was down on the pipe.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Well, on top of that, if you look and lower your light a bit lower,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
you'll have a blue cap come up.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
A blue cap, that's because it's on top of the light.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And sometimes you reach up in the gauze of the lamp, you see a devi lamp.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And then I went to see them and they said, ask me what's the matter?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I told them that we couldn't work, that light was bad.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And I said, the place is full of gases.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
No, never, they said.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
For the examiner that was around the night before, he used to examine for the day shift.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
He always reported all clear and he used to be reporting a lot of lies.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So I always found gas where I was working.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Did you ever work in naked light pits?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Oh yes.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
What sort of light did you use then?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Oh, oil lamp.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And stick them in a loop in your cap.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Did you use candles at all?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Oh yes.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And clay to stick them up.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
On your cap?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Yes, on your phone or stick them on the posts.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
On the supports of the top or on the side, according to where you were working.
