Dwi ddim yn hoffi hynny'n bach,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.360
ond, ym mhob, unrhyw beth oherwydd, roedd yn dda.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.360
Pa ganddyn nhw wedi gweithio yno, o'n mynd?

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.360
Yn y brifysgol?

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.360
Oedd un peth dŵr.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.360
Roeddwn i'n meddwl,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.360
gallai bod 200 o'r ddau,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.360
iawn, dda.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.360
Mae'n dda, a'n dda,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.360
a'r hollol gwaith a'r adnoddau,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.360
mae'n dda, a'r hollol dda.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.360
A oedd hynny'n dda ar gael,

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.360
ar gael a phobl, neu'n bach?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.360
Ar gael.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.360
Yn oherwydd, mae'r mŵyn yn ddynnu'r gwaith,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.360
os oes eu gwneud yn iawn,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.360
roeddwn i'n dda.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.360
A'r bos, y manegor yna,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.360
Bryn James, roedd hi wedi'i gael.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.360
A roedd y manegor o'r ffactor yna,

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.360
neu roedd hi'n gweithio ar y ffactor Lundain.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.360
Felly, roedd yn dda ar gael

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.360
un ddau ar gael yna,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.360
pan oedd yn gweithio yno,

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.360
roedd yn dda ar gael y peth y byddech chi'n ei wneud?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.360
Pan roeddwn yn y gwaith,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.360
a'n gweithio'r gwaith,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.360
roedd yn dda ar gael,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.360
a'r bobl yn gweithio ar y ffactor,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.360
ac roedd yn gweithio fel hyn.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.360
Ond gallwn ni siarad,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.360
ac maen nhw'n gweithio ar,

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.360
gallwch chi siarad os ydych chi eisiau.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.360
Felly roedd yn dda ar gael,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.360
roeddwn i'n edrych i fynd i weithio,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.360
oherwydd o'r ffactor roedd yn dda.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.360
Felly, roedd yn y gwaith o'r ffactor?

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.360
Roedd yn y ffactor, yma.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.360
Roedd yn y gwaith.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.360
A pan oedd yn cael ei ddod o'r blwc,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.360
roedd yn cael ei ddod yn gyflawni'n beth,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.360
ac yna roedd yn mynd i'r gwells yn y botw,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.360
ac roedd yn cael ei ddod yn y bobl,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.360
yn cael ei ddod yn y bobl,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.360
yn y bobl.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.360
Ie, yn dda.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.360
A oes gennych chi ddod o'r ffactor?

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.360
A oes gennych chi ddod o'r ffactor?

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.360
A oes gennych chi ddod o'r ffactor?

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.360
Ie, roedd yn y gwaith.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.360
Roedd yn y gwaith.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.360
Gwnaethon i gael,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.360
mae'r ffactor hynny,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.360
gwnaethon ni'n dda,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.360
yn dda, yn dda.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.360
A os oedd o'r ffactor,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.360
roedden nhw'n ddod o'r ffactor,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.360
a'r ffactor yn cael ei ddod yn y bobl.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.360
Mae'n dda, yn dda, yn dda.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.360
Roedd o'r ffactor yn gwneud yn y canthin,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.360
os oedd o'r ffactor?

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.360
Nid, nid yn dda.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.360
Mae'r un o'r ddod yn mynd i Mrs Jobe,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.360
mae'r ddod yn chef,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.360
mae'r ddod yn y canthin,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.360
a phat y byddwn yn gwneud y cac,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.360
a byddwn yn synghau i'r ddod,

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.360
yn dda, yn dda, yn dda.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.360
Mae'r boxau yna,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.360
roedden nhw'n dda,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.360

yn dda, yn dda, yn dda.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.360
Roeddwn i'n dweud,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.360
roedden ni'n cael regex yn ôl,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.360
oherwydd, yna,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.360
os oedd yn y gwaith,

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.360
oedd angen gwaith ymlaen

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.360
o'r pwmpen o'r ffactor,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.360
rydych chi'n dda i ddod glw yn y canlyniadau

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.360
a yna rydych chi'n dda i ddod yn ôl.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.360
Ac yn dda, yn dda, yn dda,

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.360
rydych chi'n dda i ddod yn ôl.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.360
A'r boxau yna'n dda i ddod yn ôl.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.360
Ond fel y ddod, roedd hi'n cael morthezau arnyn nhw.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.360
Mae hynny'n dda.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.360
Felly, oedd nhw'n cael eu cymryd

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.360
gyda phethau o'r ddod yn nhw,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.360
neu oherwydd…

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.360
Oherwydd bod hi'n morthezau.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.360
Roedd hi'n cael ei chael,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.360
yn dda.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.360
Roedd hi'n cael morthezau, oes?

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.360
Ie.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.360
Mae'r boxau oedd yn dod yn ôl

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.360
Ond roedd hi'n cael ei chael.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.360
Felly, beth oedd o'n dda i ddod

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.360
i'r morthezau yna?

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.360
Mae'n dda.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.360
Mae'n dda.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.360
Ac un peth o'r ddod yn dda.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.360
Ac un peth o'r ddod yn dda.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.360
A oes gennych chi'n dda

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.360
pa mor o bwynt i chi

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.360
pan oeddwch chi'n cael gweithio yno?

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.360
Mae'n dda.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.360
Dwi'n credu bod yna £2 i'w start.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.360
A yna,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.360

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.360
£250 o beth oedd.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.360
Ie.

A beth oeddwn yn siarad amdano yma?

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.360
Yn oed.

Roeddwn i'n 14.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.360
Roeddwn i'n 14.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.360
Felly beth oedd yn oed yno?

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.360
Roeddwn i'n siarad

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.360

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.360
Beth oeddwch chi'n ddweud?

Ie, byddwn yn oed yno.

Ie, byddwn yn oed yna.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.360
Yn oed.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.360
Beth oeddwch chi'n ei wneud gyda'r fath o?

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.360
Rwy'n rhoi'r mwyaf o'n

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.360
i fy mwyaf.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.360
Ac yna beth oeddwn i wedi gael gweithio.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.360
Roeddwn i'n ffyrdd.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.360
Roeddwn i'n cael 200 partner

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.360
pan oeddwn yn mynd i Grimraen.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.360
Roeddwn i'n cael gweithio 2 ffyrdd.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.360
Roeddwn i'n byw yn Caerfyn yna yn ystod.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.360
Roeddwn i'n byw yn Caerfyn i gael Cymfeig.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.360
Gweithio yno

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.360
ac yn ystod yno am y beth yma.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.360
Felly,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.360
Ac yna ydw i ddim yn gallu

ddod unrhyw ddau yn y canthu.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.360
Pan oedd y ffyrdd wedi'i gael gweithio?

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.360
Oeddwn i'n siarad.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.360
Roeddwn i'n

50 arall yno.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.360
Roeddwn i'n byw yn Bryn Mernin.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.360
Roeddwn i'n byw yn Brynt

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.360
yng Nghymru yn ddiweddar.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.360
Rwy'n siarad yn ystod y peth yma.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.360
Roeddwn i'n siarad yn y ffyrdd newydd

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.360
yma,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.360
a'i ddod yn y canthu

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.360
yna,

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.360
oherwydd,

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.360
yn y ffyrdd angen,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.360
dydyn ni ddim yn cael canthu.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.360
Rwy'n siarad.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.360
Roeddwn i'n siarad yn y ffyrdd angen.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.360
Mae'n ffyrdd angen iawn,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.360
ond yn dda.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.360
Ond,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.360
yn Bryn Mernin,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.360
oherwydd roedd y ffyrdd angen,

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.360
yn dda iawn.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.360
Pa yw'r ffacilafau

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.360
ar y canthu ac y tolydd?

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.360
Ymlaen i'r

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.360
ffacilau angen,

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.360
y tolydd, popeth,

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.360
yno. Mae'n dda iawn.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.360
Beth am ymlaen ymlaen ymgyrch, yw, yw, rwy'n meddwl yw,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.360
ond y llwythiwn a'r llwythiwn, beth yw hynny?

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:02.360
Mae hynny'n dda iawn, hefyd, a'r llwythiwn, oherwydd roedd hi'n cael ymlaen

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:08.360
ymlaen ymlaen ymlaen, ond y boel hwn.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:44.360
A oedd hynny'n dda iawn yn y ffactor dynol? A oedd hynny'n dda iawn i'w gweithio ar unrhyw amser?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.360
A oedd pobl yn credu ei fod yn rhaid i'w gweithio oherwydd yna oedd anhygoel?

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.360
Rwy'n credu bod hynny'n cael ei gweithio un neu ddwy.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.360
Rwy'n credu bod hynny'n cael anhygoel, a'u bod yn dda,

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.360
roedd y brydau oedd yn dda iawn, yw hynny.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.360
Ond rydym wedi gweithio drwy'r bryd, rydym wedi gwneud y beth.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.360
Roedd y beth yma…

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.360
O, dwi'n dda, dwi ddim yn ymwneud â'r beth yma, yn eich bod…

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.360
Roedd eich mam yn cael eu beth o'ch bach yma, yw eich mam?

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:18.360
Yn oed, oes y 2 £, neu 250, dwi'n gael y mwyaf o'r beth.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.360
A dwi'n cael am un £ i fy hun, yw hynny.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.360
Ond roedd fy mam yn dda i'n cael ei beth i'i ddod.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.360
Felly roeddwn i'n cael ei gael i'i ddod.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.360
A oedd hynny'n dda fel hyn, o oedd yn…

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.360
Yn oed, roedd yn cael eich mam yn dda i'i ddod?

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.360
Ie, oherwydd roeddwn i'n edrych yn fawr i'r bach, yn eich bod yn dda,

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.360
oherwydd roeddwn i'n credu, o'n i'n gallu brynu blwg neu'r scot yn y ddod.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.360
Ond roeddwn i'n mynd i'r holl, a roedd fy mam yn dda i'n dda i'n dda.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.360
Roedd fy fater yn cael ei beth yn dda, yn dda, dwi ddim yn dda, yn eich bod yn dda.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.360
Felly roeddwn i ddim yn gallu gweld fy fater yn dda, felly roeddwn i'n gallu gweld hynny yn y ddod.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.360
Ie, mae'n dda, mae'n dda.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.360
Felly roeddwn i ddim wedi cael llawer o fath o'ch hunain?

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.360
Nid, roeddwn i ddim wedi.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.360
Roeddwn i'n ei fwyaf o'n i'n ddod oherwydd roeddwn i'n gael i Glynus a Doreen,

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.360
ac roeddwn i'n mynd i Gen i Bryntirion.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.360
Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ffotoedd, roeddwn i'n dda.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.360
Roeddwn i'n dda?

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.360
Rwyf wedi ei ddod yn dda.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.360
Roeddwn i'n dda.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.360
Roeddwn i'n dda.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.360
Roeddwn i'n dda.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.360
Roeddwn i dda.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.360
Roeddwn i'n dda.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.360
Ie, yn bwysig.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.360
Do you remember how much that was?

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.360
I can't at the moment to be honest with you.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.360
It'll come back to me.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.360
This was where I thought if I could go and touch the secretary

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.360
that she was in Underpartners

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.360
she'd know all the answers.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.360
All right, yeah, yeah.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.360
Erm,

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.360
what I was going to ask you was about overtime.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.360
You said there was, er, did you work

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.360
shifts at all in the factory

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.360
or was it always those hours?

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.360
It was always those hours, yeah.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.360
But you could work overtime sometimes?

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.360
They would ask you, yes,

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.360
would you like to work overtime?

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.360
And I jumped to it every time.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.360
And when did you do the overtime?

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.360
Was it in the evening or was it on a Saturday?

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.360
In the evening

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.360
after 5.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.360
And sometimes they would say,

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.360
could you come in Saturday morning?

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.360
And we never turned it down

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.360
because it was extra money, you know.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.360
Was it a different

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.360
rate for overtime or was it the same

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.360
rate? I mean, was it like

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.360
time and a half or was it, you know,

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.360
that kind of thing?

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.360
I'm not quite sure,

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.360
to be honest with you.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.360
I can get that for you.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.360
You know. Yes.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.360
OK.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.360
What about unions

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.360
in the factory? Were there any unions

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.360
in the factory?

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.360
No, we didn't have a union. You didn't? No.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.360
Right. No, I know

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.360
that for a fact we didn't have one.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.360
Right. OK. Were the management

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.360
opposed to that or was it

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.360
that the workers

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.360
weren't interested? What do you think?

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.360
I think the workers

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.360
were so overwhelmed

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.360
with how it was run

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.360
that they didn't see any need

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.360
of having a union, you know.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.360
So there were no disputes,

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.360
nothing like that?

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.360
No, can't remember them anyway.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.360
Except for this time when people were a bit cold.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.360
Yeah. And if you did

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.360
have a dispute about something,

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.360
you just made an appointment and you saw

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.360
the management, you know,

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.360
and they'd sort it out for you. Or you tell

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.360
your supervisor or the

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.360
boss of the floor.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.360
Yeah, it was a really happy place, to be

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.360
honest with you. So you think

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.360
they were really good employers, do you?

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.360
Wonderful. Yeah. Absolutely wonderful.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.360
Yeah.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.360
I mean, I hadn't worked

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.360
for anywhere else, so I don't know.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.360
But I just thought every

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.360
factory was like this one, because they were so good.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.360
Yes.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.360
What about holidays then?

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.360
What kind of holidays did you

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.360
remember when you had holidays?

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.360
Always the miners

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.360
holiday. We always,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.360
a fortnight it was closed.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.360
Seemed to work around the miners,

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.360
didn't they, you know?

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.360
Never went away anywhere.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.360
And were they paid holidays then?

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.360
You was paid

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.360
your fortnight off, yes.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.360
And what about bank holidays?

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.360
Yes, they were good there and they still,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.360
you know, you still had your money,

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.360
you know, for the holidays and everything.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.360
They were really

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.360
good to us, really.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.360
And when you allowed

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.360
days off for

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.360
special occasions,

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.360
would you have remembered

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.360
anything, you know,

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.360
or a funeral or something like that?

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.360
Do you remember anything like that?

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.360
If you asked them,

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.360
or tell them, look, I got this and such

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.360
a date,

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.360
they didn't mind at all.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.360
Because, but if

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.360
you done it and you hadn't

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.360
asked them, I don't think they liked that,

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.360
you know. So they'd have you in

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.360
to see why you hadn't

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.360
been in to ask, you know.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.360
And would you be paid for those days,

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.360
or would it be unpaid leave?

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.360
If you went, it would be

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.360
unpaid leave, yes.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.360
What about

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.360
uniform then? Did you

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.360
wear a uniform, or did

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.360
you wear, did

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.360
they provide you with a uniform,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.360
or did you provide yourself

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.360
with a uniform? When we were in the old

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.360
factory,

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.360
we wore what we wanted to wear,

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.360
you know. But

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.360
I can remember,

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.360
we all had to go into the office,

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.360
and they were saying that they were going to

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.360
put you in a, like a green dress

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.360
it was, with a nice collar

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.360
and things. And

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.360
we all wore those dresses,

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.360
and I was thrilled to bits with them.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.360
But not, not everybody

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.360
added, anyone's compulsory.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.360
But I

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.360
thought they were very nice.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.360
And did they provide you with a... They provided you

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.360
with them, yes.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.360
And did they clean them and things, or did you...

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.360
You were to

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.360
keep them tidy, you know, wash them

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.360
and iron them.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.360
I was

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.360
boss with Mr Reeves,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.360
and he did like

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.360
girls to look nice and respectful,

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.360
you know. I would say that

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.360
about him. Did you have

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.360
to

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.360
wear any other protective

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.360
wear at all?

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.360
Not when I was on the

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.360
band, when it used to, the paper

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.360
used to go around the box and fill

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.360
it in.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.360
Nothing there. You had to pull this

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.360
thing down, there was a knife attached to it.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.360
But when I was on the corner stair,

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.360
like I showed you my sister,

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.360
you shoved in four corners,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.360
you shoved in four corners,

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.360
you had finger guards.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.360
Alright.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.360
So do you think the work was dangerous

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.360
in any way?

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.360
No, not really.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.360
If you weren't sensible though, and you weren't

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.360
wearing those, you could squash your finger,

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.360
you know.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.360
Squash rather than cut them?

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.360
You'd squash it, yeah, because the thing would

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.360
come down and squash your finger.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.360
Do you remember any

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.360
accidents or people, you know...

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.360
Yeah, I do.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.360
I had my corner stair here,

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.360
and there was an SNS machine

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.360
there where she used to take

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.360
the boxes, put them on this big

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.360
block and press the pedal,

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.360
and then it would go down into the machine,

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.360
and where we used to fold them by hand,

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.360
this machine would do it, you know.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.360
And I had to scream, and

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.360
no, her hand had gone down, you know.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.360
Yeah, she had a bad finger.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.360
Bad finger?

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.360
Yeah, but she went, well,

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.360
they took her to hospital,

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.360
but it wasn't serious,

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.360
so stitched her up a bit.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.360
But if you're not

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.360
concentrating on what you're doing,

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.360
you could have a bad accident, especially

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.360
on them SS machines.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.360
Can you explain what the SS

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.360
machine was then?

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.360
It was a really

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.360
big machine, this SS,

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.360
and they had a...the big machine

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.360
was here, and they'd

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.360
have a conveyor belt going down

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.360
like that, and there was a girl on the end

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.360
packing them.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.360
And when they were

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.360
doing the SNS, she'd be up in her chair,

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.360
and there was a girl gluing

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.360
and putting the paper in, and then

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.360
she'd got the glue, and then she'd had to get

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.360
the four corners on this

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.360
box, and

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.360
then she'd put it on this big block,

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.360
and that's when she pressed the pedal.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.360
When you'd hear it going down,

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.360
it would be folding all the

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.360
paper in, you see.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.360
And then it would come back up, shoot

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.360
on the conveyor belt, and she used to stack them

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.360
up on the end.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.360
Did you ever have a go on the SS

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.360
machine? No, I didn't, to me, I'll say.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.360
My sister was on the SS machine.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.360
She was good at it.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.360
Was it a kind of

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.360
specialised job then, do you think?

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.360
Well, they had four of them, you see,

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.360
big machines, and

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.360
I think the bosses,

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.360
and if they thought you were good at something,

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.360
they'd really keep you on there, you know.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.360
Because

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.360
like the ones where you wear the

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.360
finger things,

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.360
where you put it on, and you

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.360
get the two corners together, press the

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.360
pedal, then you'd move it on, and

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.360
you'd press it again.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.360
I was on there, not very long,

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.360
and I could keep the pedal down into the

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.360
four corners.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.360
It was brilliant. And then, of course,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.360
they sent somebody out then, because

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.360
you were doing so many,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.360
they'd send somebody out behind you,

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.360
evaluating it, how you were doing it, you know.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.360
Was that the time in motion

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.360
person? Yes.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.360
Yes. So they'd

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.360
see then how many?

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.360
How you were doing, yes.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.360
And use it to measure other people?

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.360
Yes.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.360
Because really sometimes

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.360
you'd spoil it for somebody else, because

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.360
you were so fast on the machine,

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.360
and the more you do, the better it was

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.360
for you. And of course, some of the girls

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.360
couldn't do it, so you weren't doing them

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.360
any favors, really.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.360
But that's the way I like to work, you know.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.360
I was paid for doing it, so

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.360
I'd give my own.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.360
Yes. Did you

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.360
have any piecework at all?

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.360
Was it any piecework, or was it just

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.360
a kind of rate?

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.360
You know, for how many boxes

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.360
you could do?

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.360
Yes, they expected you to do so many,

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.360
you know what I mean, after that.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.360
I think you had a bit

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.360
extra for what you were doing over,

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.360
you know. So that's why

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.360
I used to do them so quick.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.360
Yes.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.360
So were you aware of people

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.360
having different wages,

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.360
you know, for different jobs?

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.360
Or was it basically

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.360
the same kind of wage,

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.360
with a bit extra for piecework?

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.360
I think we were more or less

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.360
all on the same.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.360
Except there was loads of tables going

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.360
down, and the packers,

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.360
called them packers,

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.360
and they'd be packing the boxes in this

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.360
brown paper, and sealing

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.360
all them up. Then they'd go to the

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.360
loading bale, and

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.360
the fella from London

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.360
used to pick them up, and take

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.360
them back up to the factory in London.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.360
I think they were

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.360
on the best money, really.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.360
The packers? The packers, they used to call them.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.360
And were they women as well?

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.360
All women, yes.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.360
When do you think they had to

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.360
work more then?

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.360
I don't know, I don't know really, no.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.360
But it wasn't a hard

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.360
job really, but if they got the big boxes,

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.360
it's

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.360
more what's called then, you know.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.360
More physical. Yeah, and they had to,

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.360
I think to get where they went to the dog

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.360
war, they had to keep

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.360
at it, you know.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.360
Were you made aware of any kind

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.360
of rules and regulations while you

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.360
worked in the factory?

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.360
No, only to wear, if you had to wear

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.360
guard things,

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.360
they'd nip around and they'd see if

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.360
you got them on, you know.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.360
And we had

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.360
a nurse there.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.360
We had a nurse's

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.360
room, you know. So they'd

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.360
leave everything on, tidy really.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.360
So were you made aware of health and

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.360
safety then? Yes.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.360
Yes.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.360
What about the noise in the factory, was it noisy?

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.360
It was noisy

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.360
because there was the big SS machines

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.360
and everything, and

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.360
your corner stair wasn't too

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.360
noisy, but you got used

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.360
to it, you know.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.360
And anybody were?

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.360
No protection

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.360
on the ears, no. And it wasn't

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.360
that bad really, you know.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.360
I was going

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.360
to ask you about the women who worked

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.360
there then. Were you all

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.360
young women or were you

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.360
all married, married?

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.360
Did people have children, that kind of thing?

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.360
Yeah, there was lots of young girls

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.360
like myself.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.360
There was older women. I found

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.360
the older women were on the packing.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.360
And

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.360
there was women

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.360
there that had children.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.360
There was all sorts there. Were there any

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.360
childcare facilities then?

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.360
No, no.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.360
No, none.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.360
Can I ask you a bit more

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.360
then about

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.360
the kind of social

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.360
aspect?

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.360
You said there was a

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.360
evening every Tuesday.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.360
Were there other things put on

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.360
by the factory, like Christmas parties,

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.360
that kind of thing? Can you remember

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.360
anything about that?

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.360
Oh yes, I'm sure we would have had a Christmas party,

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.360
yes.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.360
Do you remember where you went?

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.360
Where you used to go? I think when

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.360
we were in the new factory, that was in the

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.360
canteen as well, because it was a big canteen,

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.360
you know. And he'd let us

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.360
put decorations

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.360
all over our machines and things like that.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.360
That was a really nice time.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.360
And he didn't mind us singing.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.360
We used to sing as loud as we could.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.360
It was really nice.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.360
And did they use to make the food and everything

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.360
in the canteen then for the...I mean,

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.360
was it a kind of dinner dance?

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.360
Oh yes, yes. It was our food

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.360
laid down.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.360
Because Mrs Jobe, the head cook,

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.360
she made my wedding cake.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.360
She was really good.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.360
Oh, did she?

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.360
Yes.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.360
And I got pregnant then.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.360
I was married.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.360
And I fell straight away

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.360
for a baby, because

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.360
my husband didn't want me to work, you see,

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.360
when I got married.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.360
And I loved it there so much.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.360
But there was another girl with me

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.360
her name was

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.360
Barnes. And she was

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.360
pregnant as well.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.360
So he took us off the machines,

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.360
this is how good they were really.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.360
And he put us in

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.360
another part where,

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.360
you know,

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.360
the boxes that all you wear in cake up,

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.360
the silver ones, we had to

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.360
do them by hand.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.360
Just in case we

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.360
stood in a trolley or we had an accident,

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.360
they were so good.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.360
Yes.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.360
How did you feel about your husband

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.360
not wanting you to work when he got married?

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.360
I was gutted really.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.360
I really was.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.360
I loved it there so much, you know.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.360
How long were you there for

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.360
before you got married then?

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.360
Oh, I got married in 56.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.360
And I

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.360
left and some partners then

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.360
for a while. And I went

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.360
student nursing.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.360
So I

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.360
just couldn't, I couldn't

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.360
take to it really. And I thought, well,

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.360
I loved it, but if my

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.360
husband didn't want me to work, I didn't want

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.360
to do all this, you know.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.360
So I did go back into the factory

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.360
and the partners.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.360
Because when I walked through the door,

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.360
they just said to me, are you back?

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.360
They were so good.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.360
So you

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.360
worked there for a while before you got married?

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.360
Oh, years, yes, years.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.360
So how did you,

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.360
I mean, did you have to stop

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.360
straight away then when

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.360
you got married?

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.360
No, you got

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.360
pregnant. Yes.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.360
And I worked there, still worked there.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.360
And my

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.360
husband owned a farm the other side of this

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.360
mountain. And I said,

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.360
oh no, because he was so lonely in the

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.360
farm, my mother-in-law was there.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.360
But I thought, no, I missed

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.360
the girls, you know what I mean.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.360
So they did let me work

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.360
as long as I could.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.360
And after I'd had the baby, I

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.360
took him to work when he was a few weeks

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.360
old. Oh, did you? Yeah.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.360
So I remember the management

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.360
coming out and they said,

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.360
that was the problem, was it?

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.360
Oh, you're

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.360
so good to work for. Yeah.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.360
Yeah.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.360
Why do you think your husband didn't

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.360
want you to work? Was it because

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.360
it was the factory or was it

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.360
work in general, do you think?

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.360
I

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.360
think

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.360
it was because they had

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.360
the farm and they had so much to

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.360
do on the farm.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.360
I must have thought I'd be better off helping

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.360
them on the farm than going to work.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.360
But I worked as

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.360
long as I could.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.360
To be honest with, I used to

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.360
walk down the lane from Corker

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.360
to Rywkeelwch Chapel

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.360
and then walk along the road because

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.360
Wyn Tarw Coleray was

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.360
there. And I used to get

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.360
on the best because my husband used

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.360
to couldn't take me, he was

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.360
working in a factory somewhere as well as

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.360
a farm. So

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.360
I got so used to it that

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.360
I always remember there was a man

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.360
called Barba from Aberkef,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.360
and he'd see me coming and he'd

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.360
put his coat down for me to walk on

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.360
to get on the best.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.360
It's so kind.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.360
So it wasn't

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.360
all easy, you know what I mean.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.360
So you must

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.360
have really missed

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.360
the camaraderie. Oh, I did.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.360
Really missed it.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.360
Yes.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.360
But do you think it was because

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.360
it was factory work especially, or was

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.360
it just any kind of work that he didn't

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.360
want you to work?

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.360
Any kind of work

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.360
I think he would have.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.360
But I could say, no I'm not,

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.360
I'm going, you know what I mean, and I do it.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.360
Yes.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.360
But of course

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.360
you had to give up when you were

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.360
pregnant. Did you have to give up when you were pregnant?

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.360
Well they let me

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.360
stay in the factory.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.360
Colin was born

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.360
in the October,

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.360
and I think I finished about

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.360
a month before.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.360
Right.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.360
He came to me there.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.360
So

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.360
what did you do then?

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.360
Well once I had the baby

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.360
that was it.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.360
You had a baby, you had to look after

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.360
the baby and things like that.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.360
And then fifteen

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.360
months later I was pregnant again.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.360
And that went along

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.360
until I had five children.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.360
So my life

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.360
was around my children then.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.360
Yes.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.360
Yes.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.360
You said

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.360
you were allowed to chat while you were working.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.360
What kind of thing did you talk

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.360
about in to you?

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.360
Well you should say that.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.360
I went to St. David's Church the other day.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.360
I think I told you I had somebody tap me on the shoulder.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.360
And it was a friend

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.360
from the box factory.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.360
And we started

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.360
laughing because we used to,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.360
if I had seen a nice film, I'd be

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.360
telling her about the film.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.360
And then she was really engrossed

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.360
in it and then she'd tell me a film.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.360
You know what I mean? Oh yeah,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.360
really good.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.360
So it was that kind of

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.360
telling stories, yeah.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.360
But it didn't stop you

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.360
still carried on working you know.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.360
How did you

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.360
buy new clothes and things like that?

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.360
Did your mum used to give you

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.360
money for clothes or did you save

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.360
the little money

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.360
I had? I didn't have many clothes

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.360
to be honest with you. That's what I,

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.360
when I worked overtime I'd take all lovely blouse

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.360
on the weekend. But nothing materialised

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.360
out of that. But

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.360
the one that

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.360
was very kind to me, I had an uncle

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.360
in Llanelli and he used to come to see us.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.360
And he always put a pound in my hand.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.360
And all lovely.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.360
So I used to buy my own clothes

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.360
then you know to me.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.360
What I could afford I get you know.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.360
That was a lot of money then if you were

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.360
only earning two pounds something.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.360
It was, do, best uncle I ever had.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.360
Used to own

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.360
snips in

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.360
Swansea.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.360
I think it was.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.360
I think it was snips.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.360
Man's clothing shop

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.360
you know.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.360
Very kind. My sister and I always rubbed

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.360
our hands when we saw him coming.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.360
Were people allowed

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.360
to smoke in the factory?

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.360
Or where did they smoke?

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.360
Yes,

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.360
they could smoke in the factory.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.360
On the floor? Yes.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.360
While they were making the boxes?

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.360
I think that

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.360
well.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.360
Because I was the smoker.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.360
No I think we had to eat a lot of times.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.360
Right, so where did you

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.360
smoke then? In the canteen?

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.360
In the canteen, yes.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.360
On a nice day we were outside.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.360
Do you think you've suffered any

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.360
long term effects from working in the

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.360
factory? Ill health or anything

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.360
like that?

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.360
No I don't think so. I don't think

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.360
there was anything there that would harm you.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.360
Except in the old factory

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.360
most probably they had these

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.360
what do they call them, on the roof.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.360
Asbestos sheets.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.360
Oh right yes. Did anybody suffer

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.360
from that? Not that I

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.360
can recall.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.360
What about the glue?

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.360
Did that used to?

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.360
When I went there first it used

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.360
to make me feel a bit sicky.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.360
You know the smell it was.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.360
But there again you got used

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.360
to it. Yes, well it

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.360
no ill effects from

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.360
sniffy glue I was going to say.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.360
No, it was only the glue that they put in

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.360
when she's taken the paper off the

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.360
big S machines.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.360
The big glue thing you know.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.360
But as for the other ones if you're working

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.360
on the side and you're doing the small boxes

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.360
that glue was okay.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.360
Do you remember

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.360
how did you get on with

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.360
the male workers in the

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.360
factory? I know there weren't many of them

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.360
were there. But were the

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.360
relationships good between the

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.360
men and women? Yes, wonderful.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.360
Yes, really wonderful.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.360
Did you used to tease each other?

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.360
If Charlie come to do your machine

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.360
he tease

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.360
you, you know what I mean.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.360
But we used to give him as good as he gave us

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.360
sort of thing. He always laughed.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.360
They were very, very

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.360
nice.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.360
Do you remember any

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.360
day trips or anything like that

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.360
you went on from the factory?

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.360
The only trip I can remember is going

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.360
to Barton Fair, whatever that was.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.360
I remember going on that.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.360
Where is that? I don't know.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.360
In England somewhere. In England somewhere, yes.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.360
Who arranged that then?

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.360
I think the boss would put

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.360
it on to the supervisors

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.360
to see who wanted to go and

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.360
things like that.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.360
I can't remember how much

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.360
it cost.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.360
How did you go?

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.360
They put on a vest there.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.360
Did a crowd of you go?

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.360
Yes, the vest was always full.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.360
Do you remember what you

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.360
did of a day? How long

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.360
was the day? That kind of thing?

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.360
They'd give you most of the day there.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.360
We'd go around Barton Fair

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.360
it was called.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.360
We'd go around there,

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.360
what we liked, and then we'd go and have

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.360
something sweet.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.360
That sort of thing. There was a beach

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.360
there if I remember.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.360
What kind of fair was it? Was it

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.360
a market or was it a fairground?

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.360
It was a fairground,

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.360
a big one.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.360
That was the original.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.360
That was the main one that I can gather

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.360
then. Huge rides.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.360
Not like they had

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.360
a day in mind but we thought it was huge rides.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.360
Do you remember how

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.360
when did you get home at night?

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.360
Was that a very long day?

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.360
Was it a far away?

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.360
Yes, it was a long day.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.360
It was quite dark when we got back.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.360
All shattered

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.360
but nice.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.360
On your holidays

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.360
holidays you didn't used to go

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.360
away did you?

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.360
No, I could never afford to go away.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.360
I knew the news of it in them days

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.360
that they went to Tenerife

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.360
in Spain and Hong Kong and places

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.360
like that.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.360
Push call, that was about it.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.360
Or Sathertown.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.360
We used to go on our

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.360
bikes, all us girls

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.360
we had a bike. Dorian sold me

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.360
her bike. We had to give her

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.360
three pence a week.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.360
We all used to go on our

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.360
bikes. So you went with your

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.360
childhood friends rather than your

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.360
factory friends? Yes, some of the girls

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.360
in the factory would join us.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.360
So tell me about the canteen.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.360
Shirley Davis was one of the girls

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.360
and we'd sit together

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.360
in the canteen.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.360
My mother used to open my

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.360
box and my mother used to give us

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.360
bread and bits and

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.360
a stick of celery.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.360
She used to open her

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.360
box and she had lovely beetroot sandwiches

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.360
and a bit of cheese on the side

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.360
and I used to think, ooh.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.360
She always gave me one.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.360
Then we ended up there and she said,

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.360
what if we now have the sandwiches

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.360
and have a plate

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.360
of chips between us?

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.360
We started doing that

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.360
and really loved it.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:43:00.360
Do you think it was a physically demanding work?

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.360
Did you feel maybe a little bit underfed?

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.360
In which way, no.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.360
Do you think it was physically demanding,

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.360
the work?

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.360
Just long hours?

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.360
It was long hours, yes.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.360
That was one thing about it.

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.360
But that's how they were, factories in

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.360
them days, weren't they?

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.360
Yes, but we never moaned about it.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.360
We just got on with it.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.360
And you were a growing girl,

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.360
of course, you were only 14.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.360
That's right, yes.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.360
When I left then, really,

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.360
to get married, 21.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.360
Right.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.360
Would you have liked to have gone back

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:44.360
to work in the factory when you were a child?

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:48.360
If I hadn't had one every 15 months,

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.360
I think I would have had somebody

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.360
to look after and I would have.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.360
But I had a responsibility

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.360
to the children.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.360
You say that the woman in the canteen,

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.360
the cook made your wedding cake.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.360
Mrs Job.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.360
Made your wedding cake.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.360
How did that come about?

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.360
Did you ask her?

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.360
Well, my sister got married

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.360
here before me.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.360
She married a fellow in that photo

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.360
I showed you.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.360
She used to take the boxes back up to London

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.360
and fell for Joan and they got married.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.360
And Mrs Job made their cake.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.360
So you went by and then I got married.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.360
And we came up in the canteen then.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.360
Mrs Job was on about the cake.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.360
I said, would you mind to be mine?

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.360
Not at all, she said.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.360
So it was three hearts.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.360
It was really lovely.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.360
So how did that go then?

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.360
Did you pay for the ingredients

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.360
and she made it?

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.360
Did you pay her to make it?

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.360
She made the complete cake

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.360
and then I had to pay her.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.360
But my dad helped out there.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.360
What do you remember about it,

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.360
the taste and things?

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.360
Was it a good cake?

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.360
Oh, beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.360
Did you say it was a three tier?

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.360
Three tier, three hearts.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.360
Yeah, lovely.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.360
She was a really good cook.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.360
And the lady that I went to get in touch with,

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.360
Mrs Job was her mother.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.360
The secretary in the box factory.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:22.360
Mrs Job was her mother.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.360
So I am sure Mrs Job would have had

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.360
a nice lot of photos.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.360
So I'll have to try and get in touch with her.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.360
So do you remember going out with

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.360
your colleagues anywhere else?

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.360
Did you see them?

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.360
No, I didn't.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.360
Anyone else?

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.360
Did you used to see them on the weekend?

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.360
Yes, we used to go to St Athens on a Friday.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.360
I never used to tell my mother.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.360
That's the wicked thing I'd done.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.360
Because my father always wanted to know where you were.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.360
When I went dancing,

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.360
he'd be there waiting in the bus stop

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.360
for you to be on that last bus with him,

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.360
you know, before he lived in Brinteria.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.360
And he was really wonderful like that, you know.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.360
He was really good.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.360
So what was in St Athan then?

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.360
What did he do?

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.360
He was a dancer, a big dancer,

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.360
and all the girls used to go.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.360
And the bus used to pick him up behind Woolworths in Bridgend.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.360
We'd all be looking out for our fathers

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.360
because he used to tell our fathers.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.360
And then I used to stay in my friend's house.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.360
My mother would let me stay with my friend in Saan.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.360
And we had a really nice weekend.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.360
But then we'd go dancing then.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.360
That was Friday.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.360
We'd go to the town hall in Bridgend on a Saturday.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.360
We'd go to the Palli di Dance on a Wednesday.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.360
If there was a dance on, we were there, you know.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.360
So how did you get to all these places?

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.360
By bus.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.360
And were there late buses to get you back?

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.360
Or did you have to be indoors?

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.360
We had a private bus going to St Athan.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.360
But going to Bridgend,

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.360
when I lived in Brinteria,

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.360
we could walk, you see.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.360
It was a good place.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.360
And I was a bit worried.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.360
I was worried about my father.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.360
But in Brinteria, we could walk, you see.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.360
It was a gang of us.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.360
So, really nice.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.360
So in St Athan,

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:18.360
were you looking for RAF boys to dance with?

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.360
They were all RAF boys, yeah.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:24.360
I did meet a nice RAF boy there.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.360
Very nice.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.360
But you married somebody else?

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.360
I married somebody else, yeah.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.360
A stranger he goes, innit?

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.360
Oh.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.360
So, right.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.360
Can I just ask you then,

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.360
did you enjoy working in the factory?

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.360
I loved it.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.360
Were you ever bored, or was it monotonous?

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.360
Sometimes it went a bit slack

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.360
on the jobs that you were to do.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.360
And then they'd give you another job,

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.360
or go and sit by your machine

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.360
and turn in the boxes in for her, you know.

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:02.360
And I don't think I was bored

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.360
because you were talking all the time, you know.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:10.360
And it didn't interrupt your work as you were talking.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.360
It was really nice.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.360
I would advise anyone to have gone to work there.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:20.360
Oh, and we did have a trip to the London factory

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:24.360
for us to see how they were doing, you know.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.360
Same thing, SS machines, corner machines.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.360
When my sister married Bob,

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.360
she went in the factory in London

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.360
because that's where he was from, you know.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:38.360
So, and they used to put, good morning.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.360
Hi.

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.360
She's my grandson.

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.360
So this trip to the London factory,

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.360
was that a social occasion?

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.360
They used to put a social evening on for us.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:52.360
They'd show us around the factory and the girls there.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.360
And they did put a social evening on for us.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.360
Did you do it more than once then?

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.360
Yes, I can remember doing it about twice.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.360
So you used to go up to London.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.360
Did you used to come back the same day

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.360
or did you used to stay up there?

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.360
Back the same day, yeah.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.360
And was that again on a coach?

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.360
Yes, yeah. All laid on.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.360
So, and they put a kind of social evening on for you?

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.360
Yes, and you had food, you know, sandwiches, cakes, you name it.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.360
A bit of dancing?

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.360
Yeah.

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.360
Did you make friends with anybody up there?

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.360
Well, I did.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.360
I met my sister's husband before she did, you know.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.360
And it was very funny because he said,

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.360
when he was down in Bridgend,

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.360
he said, all those girls in the factory, you know,

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.360
he said, I was looking around, he said, and I picked two girls.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.360
I said, oh, very nice.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.360
He said, you were the first,

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.360
and he didn't know she was my sister.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.360
And she was the second.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.360
She married him.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.360
Yes.

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:08.360
So, when you left because you were pregnant,

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:14.360
did you have a farewell party or anything like that when you left?

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.360
No, no, nothing like that.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:28.360
Are you in contact with your former workmates from the factory?

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:33.360
No, only the one I met last week.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.360
And Iris had been up here.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:41.360
No, Sheila had been up here, the one that's worked in the factory.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:46.360
She came up here, I think it was November, August, round about there.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.360
So, I can get in touch with her again, you know.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.360
And she brought this girl Anne up,

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.360
and she used to be on an SNS machine.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:01.360
And did you know her in the factory?

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.360
Yes, oh yes, I knew Anne as well.

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:08.360
But really your family took over then?

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.360
You weren't in kind of continuous contact with them?

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.360
No, no.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:18.360
But you've kept contact with your childhood friends?

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.360
Yes.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:26.360
Looking back now, how do you feel about the time you spent working in the factory?

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.360
I would love it all over again.

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.360
That's how good it was, you know.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.360
Why do you think that was?

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:40.360
I think it was the atmosphere there, and the management was so good too.

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:45.360
I mean, they had their rules, you weren't supposed to run and things like that.

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.360
Like you said, smoking.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.360
I remember now we weren't allowed to smoke, only in the canteen or outside.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.360
But they were so good to us.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:01.360
Mind you, Mr Reeves, the manager, very, very nice man.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:08.360
But we all stood up to him then, like he said, we were strict, you know.

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.360
We all treated him with respect.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:16.360
Do you think you'll miss the independence?

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.360
Yes.

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:23.360
When I met Mr Reeves, Mrs Jordan made a cricket cake.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:27.360
Her daughter phoned me up, oh I'm going back.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.360
My sister was alive then.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:38.360
And she phoned me up to say, I'm going back about five years, my sister's gone.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.360
About six years now.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.360
She said, would you like to come down this evening?

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.360
She said, Pat, she said.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.360
She lives in Brinkheath Inn.

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.360
I said, oh, what's this about?

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.360
She said, Mr Reeves will be here from London.

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.360
And seeing him all those years.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.360
And some of the girls from the box factory.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.360
Boys, I'd love it.

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.360
So we were all in her house where we chatted all night over the factory.

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:08.360
Can I just clarify, this is Mrs Job who made the cake for you?

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.360
Her daughter.

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:11.360
Yes, Sheila Morgan.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.360
So what was that like then?

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.360
It was strange because it didn't look like him.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.360
He was really old then.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:23.360
I'm 79 and he's older than me.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.360
He looked good in health.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.360
We were all chatting there.

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.360
John said, he knew my sister straight away.

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.360
But he didn't know me.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.360
I said, oh well, thank you very much.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.360
But it was a lovely evening.

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.360
We were all reminiscing back.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.360
And you could see when we were talking about the factory.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.360
We were loving it.

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.360
So you think everybody who worked there felt the same?

00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:59.360
I think so, yeah, I really do.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:03.360
This is why Doreen tried to get into the factory for a long time.

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.360
But they weren't taking any more on, you see.

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:11.360
So you thought, you think it had a reputation around here for being a good employer?

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.360
Yes, definitely, yeah.
