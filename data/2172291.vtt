00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
So good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Malith. This is Paminda and Robin interviewing

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:18.120
Malith at her home in Swansea. And this is the Tuesday the 16th of July 11.15am. Thank

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.960
you very much, Malith. And really this is a story about you. So let me launch into a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:33.240
first question. Your early memories of Kampala and Uganda? Well, I didn't know any different.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:41.760
We lived in a little suburb of Kalolo, which is a beautiful area and beautiful houses,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.600
not as tall as this house, but lovely houses and bungalow with a beautiful front garden,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.440
with a pomegranate tree. As you stood in the house, you looked right. There was a pomegranate

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:03.320
tree on the right. So very happy memories, actually. I was born in 61, after a very,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.080
very long wait. Mum and Dad had been married for about 20 odd years, so it was a really

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.160
lovely welcome surprise. And I was told that, because I didn't know where babies came from,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.320
because we didn't talk about things like that. So I was saying, how did I come to be here

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.320
to my mum? So I was defrosted from a hospital freezer. So I was really, you know, and I

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.880
said, why did you pick me? Well, I was the prettiest one there. So, you know, that's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.080
how it all happened. And of course, that was perfectly fine by me. And yeah, beautiful

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.680
in a lovely home in Kallolo on Bukota Street and pomegranate tree on the right, lovely

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.280
garden. And then we used to grow pineapple. My sister and I would grow pineapple, but

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.480
of course we kept digging it up to see how it's grown. So we used to disturb them too

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.720
much. And then on the back there was papaya tree growing, which didn't always give us

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.720
a lot of fruit, but the pomegranate was really abundant. And we also had a beautiful scented,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
fragrant frangipani tree called Champa. It's a Champa family. And when the flowers used

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.040
to fall, my sister and I used to trample on them, but they'd always bounce back up. So

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.480
it was like they were very forgiving, I used to say. The flowers are very forgiving, but

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.480
the scent was absolutely gorgeous. And the market, which was superb, was just down the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.520
road really on Bukota Street, out of the house left, and you were in the beautiful market.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.400
And my sister and I used to go down with my mum, and we used to, if we were lucky, we

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.520
would be given, treated to a sugar cane juice. So there was a man with a mangle, and the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.440
juice would drop into a bucket, and we would have that while mum did her shopping, and

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.160
everybody carried a bit back. I was the eldest with my sister and myself, so I carried more.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.920
But the African women would come to sell their green beans and what have you, and their wares,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.680
or the makai, which is the corn, all with the head and everything on, which is wonderful

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.120
really, and a lot of sound noise, and then we'd have a good time, go along the little

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.720
market street, and then come back home with them, having had our treat. And sometimes

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.880
we used to get lucky, and there would be a candy floss machine, which was amazing to

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.880
see candy floss being made. You know, this is sort of 60s, 70s, so it was really exciting

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.400
to see a candy floss machine. We didn't have a lot of toys, but we had a very happy childhood,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:59.120
as we thought, and on the back of the house was a big yard really, so we were very naughty,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.680
and it was a flat roof, so we lived in an extended family, which is quite normal because

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.200
my father and my mother, that marriage was a second marriage for both of them, because

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.200
both their partners had died. And what had happened was my dad got widowed, his first

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.400
wife died in a fire, and the boys that they had were only one and a half and two and a

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.400
half years old, so in those days it was okay to remarry under those circumstances, and

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.400
my dad was making a lot of money, he was one of the wealthiest men in Uganda, he was listed,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.480
and so he went to India to find a bride to Gujarat, and he went to Rawal, because my

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.400
dad originally was from Singara, but the farm would always fail, there wasn't enough crops,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.280
and their father, their parents said, you've just got to try and get out of here, you know,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.400
you can't survive like this, so the four brothers, my father was the second of the four brothers,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.080
they all went to Uganda and tried to make a success of their lives, and my dad was one

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.080
of the most successful people, but without a wife and two small children, there was an

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.880
accident with a fire, that's how she died, because in those days you'd have, you didn't

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.480
have like an iron that plugged in into electrics, you had a coal iron, and also there was open

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:46.480
fuel there, with open source of liquid fuel, and of course we had staff, which sounds terrible,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.640
but we had a lot of Africans working for us, like my sister and I also had a maid, and

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.720
that was all quite normal, because we employed people, and when Mrs Rupert really had the

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.080
first caught fire, she was wearing her sari, but instead of what she should have done was

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.520
took her sari off as it caught fire, but you wouldn't undress in front of the staff, African

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.360
male staff, or even female staff, so what she did was she ran to the outside loo to

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.040
try and get the water from the loo, but there wasn't enough water in there, and as a result

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:32.040
she burned to death, so it was a dreadful tragedy, so my father was left with two small

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:40.240
boys, one and a half and two and a half year old, and so he went to India to find a bride,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.440
which was again quite normal in those days, and he heard about a woman whose husband had

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.240
also died, and my mother's first husband, I asked her, she was married at something

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.120
like fifteen, because in those days, that's girls, as soon as they reach puberty, you

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.680
had to get them quickly married and settled, and I said to my mother, what happened to

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.880
your first husband, because I was, I think even as a small child I was probably a little

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.200
researcher growing, so I was always asking questions, and I was just relentless, and

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.360
I think she didn't know quite how to deal with me, so in the end she would answer me,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.440
she was very reluctant to talk about negative things, because I think obviously looking

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.180
back as an adult now, it must have brought up terrible memories for her, so I said, what

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.200
happened to your husband, and she used to say, oh he was a lovely man, we were only

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.480
married nine months, and she used to say, you know where the wee wee comes from, because

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.880
we didn't know anatomical words, and you know where a man does his wee wee, well instead

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.600
of wee wee there would be a lot of blood coming out, so I worked out, it was, and she said

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.880
it was a cancer, so I worked out it might have been a bladder cancer or something like

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.880
that, anyway within nine months of being married, he was gone, and of course she now as a widow

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.880
living with her siblings, she had two brothers and about four sisters or so, she was, it

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.480
was going to be difficult to marry her off, because once you've been married the once,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:28.480
nobody wants you again, because your clastor is like second hand goods if you like, and

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.480
so when my dad went to India and heard about this woman who'd lost her husband, he went

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:43.760
and put a proposal forward that I will marry her, I've got two small boys, one and a half,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.760
two and a half, and my mother had the proposal through her parents, my mother had never met

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.520
my dad, and my mother said no, I am not going to, because she'd never been out of the village,

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.360
so she was very frightened, I mean she's only a fifteen year old who's lost her husband,

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.280
and she said no I'm not going to Africa, you know I'm too scared, I want to stay with

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:14.940
you, obviously mum and dad, and the village, she'd never been outside of Rawal, and money

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:21.940
was tight, and she was another mouth to feed, so she just refused, but they had to sit her

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.460
down and say to her look we've got all your other sisters and we've got two brothers here,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:34.020
and basically you're another mouth to feed and nobody else is going to actually marry

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:41.020
you because you've been widowed now, and widowhood in India is well seen as, it's almost like

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:48.280
the woman is blamed for it, like bad karma, unfortunately, and there's a huge stigma about

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:56.280
losing your husband, and as you know in the years before there was the Sati, which is

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:02.280
where the widow actually burnt herself as well while the husband was on fire, being

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:09.280
cremated, and that had to be stopped then, and that practice even carries on in rural

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:17.280
India now, so they had to sit my mother down, the parents, and said basically be honest

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:25.280
with her and say to her you're another mouth to feed and we actually are struggling here,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:32.480
and my mother was persuaded to marry my dad, and the only time, the first time she saw

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.600
him was on her wedding day, and she went to raise the garland of flowers up round her

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:44.880
neck and she looked at him and she was really horrified because he had spotty skin, and

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.080
I've inherited that, so it was a bit like oh my god mum and dad what have you done to

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:57.080
me, you know, but she couldn't say anything and she was married, and off she went on a

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:04.640
long journey to East Africa having never left the village her entire life, and the fact

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.960
that the other clinch point was the fact that my dad said I don't want any dowry either,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.600
so that was a big bonus because you had to give a dowry if you wanted to marry your daughter

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:22.600
off, and sometimes in these days often the groom will ask for a car or even a house or

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:29.360
whatever before I'll marry your daughter, anyway dad was self-made and he said I don't

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.160
want anything, I don't need anything, I just want somebody, my wife, to bring up my two

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:42.480
boys and be a wife. Mum and dad went and they married in Kenya and then they settled in

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:49.800
Uganda, and he was under a lot of pressure with his work but mum brought up the two boys

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:56.360
as her own, and she always thought of them as her own boys, and so it was an incredible

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:03.160
surprise some twenty years on in her forties she managed to get pregnant, because she always

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:10.200
believed in God, very religious spiritual woman and the guru that she followed had

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:17.520
said to her to start fasting on a Thursday, that was his special day for fasting, and

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.320
I used to go to a lot of the prayers with her as I grew up and she always used to say

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:31.320
this is the guru who made you happen, and she always credited him with that, and I used

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:38.680
to go to all the temples with her and the bhajans singing and I used to sing as well

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:45.680
bhajans and hymns as equivalent to, and then two years after that my little brother was

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:56.520
born but he was still born and meanwhile my older brother, older brother, two brothers

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:04.520
we called him suru, he had children as well and the son that they had Jethan was literally

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.280
nine months difference or so between me and him because I came very late, so I was his

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:19.280
auntie but I was only literally months older than him, and then when my mum got pregnant

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:26.280
again, two years later with a son, which would have been an incredible achievement,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:34.640
especially as boys are more revered than girls, my younger brother was also getting married

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:41.640
his name was Ratilal and my mother sort of said that I'm struggling with the pregnancy

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000
in my forties and I've got this pregnancy again and asked if he would delay him from

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:56.280
his wedding so that the baby would be born and they refused to delay the wedding, he

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:06.800
refused to delay the wedding, he didn't want to wait and as a result when the baby was

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.080
born, the child, he was perfect, my mother would cry about it, he was perfect but he

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:19.080
was still born because obviously Indian weddings, the attitude was oh well don't do it, don't

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.840
do anything and just sit down but as the mother of the groom you couldn't just sit down and

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:31.560
you've got hundreds and hundreds of relatives coming from all over and there's lots of food,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:38.560
lots of preparations, prayers, different ceremonies to the wedding, it's not like just a registered

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:46.440
wedding like it is in often cases and she lost the baby and I did say to her mum could

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:54.440
you not have said delay the big wedding and she said I did try but they didn't want

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:01.600
to wait, he didn't want to wait so she always said he was perfect, your little brother,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:08.600
perfectly born and her lips would turn downwards but she would find it very difficult to cry

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:15.080
as I do actually, I don't show my emotions that easily so then two years after that she

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.040
was pregnant again and my little sister was born, another baby then was found in the hospital

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:25.280
freezer defrosted and brought home and she also was brought home because she was the

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:32.280
prettiest one in the freezer so of course it was all very magical and it was only later

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:39.920
I realised the consequence of losing the brother because obviously the male would have been

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:46.080
an amazing asset to have with us and he would have had status whereas girls don't have

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:53.080
the status and everything seemed to be fine, we lived with my older brother Suru and he

00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:00.680
had four children, three boys and a girl, we grew up together and then when I was aged

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:08.060
eight basically my partnership with grief began because my dad had a sudden heart attack

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:15.220
and I was at school and one of my cousins Ramneek came to fetch me and wouldn't tell

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:20.940
me what's wrong so I was saying what is wrong, what is wrong and he just wouldn't say what

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:26.660
was wrong, I knew something was wrong but I was just insistent but he wouldn't say and

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:32.100
he just let me find out so once we got to the house, we got back to the house there

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:38.300
was loads of shoes outside and I knew something terrible had happened and my dad had come

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:45.300
home, this was 1969 and one of the staff, I think it was Francisco, the male staff,

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:56.300
we had the African Ugandan guy had helped him up the steps and into bed and I could

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:02.620
see my dad jolting up and shaking and then my mum would push him down again to lie down

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:09.420
and he jolts up and shake and I didn't realise but that was a heart attack he was having

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:16.420
and there wasn't a lot of medicine in those days, you didn't know what had caused it and

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:25.220
he died and Chetan who was my brother's oldest son and I understood but the youngsters didn't

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:31.420
understand as much so we were just screaming and crying because we were really close to

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:36.940
dad and that was his grandad, my dad and so we were locked in the bathroom because we

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:43.940
were making such a racket and then we were taken out and then we were sent off to one

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:50.940
of my uncle's houses, just tears and snot all running down, not understanding but knew

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:58.500
that this was terrible catastrophe and then eventually we were, when all the ceremonies

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:05.500
had finished, the funeral ceremonies and the bhajans and the goodbyes and we were taken

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:14.060
back to Kalolo and there then in the lino somebody, one of the ladies said when there

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.940
were people sitting all, my dad was on the bed and people were sitting all across the

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:25.940
floor cross legged and all the way and there was hundreds of shoes there because you don't

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:32.140
take shoes into somebody's house especially at a time like that because obviously the

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:37.540
gods and goddesses are coming to collect the departed one and somebody said oh you know

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:43.300
I can see the gods here and somebody actually could see in the lino a shape of one of the

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:49.300
gods and everybody then could see it so we all had to clear this area because then it

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.900
was quite evident that the gods had come to collect my dad so it was seen as a blessing

00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:01.900
and then that area was decorated with the red, the kanku, the blessed mark and even

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:11.260
I could see the skirt and I realize now later on as a researcher when one person sees it,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.580
other people do see it but I didn't know that at the time but it seemed to give my

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:22.580
mum a lot of comfort and then I realized dad was taken away but only the men go to the

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:27.620
crematorium, the women aren't allowed because we're too delicate and it's not the done

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:34.620
thing and the first born son would light the funeral pyre and so dad was taken away and

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:42.620
then as dad was taken away mum was surrounded by lots of women, all the women were left

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:48.620
behind and mum wanted me with her, somebody else was looking after my little sister and

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:53.620
then we went back into the house and my mum was crying and saying I may as well be dead

00:19:53.620 --> 00:20:00.620
myself and I may as well just kill myself now, I've got nothing now and all the women

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.620
and this was in front of me as well and I said to mum you've got me mum, you've got

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:13.620
us mum and then when we went back up into the backyard then I noticed one of the women's

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:22.620
arms reached out and wiped away my mum's red dot on her forehead to signify her wedding,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:29.620
her marriage, you know a sign of pride and then somebody took off all her colourful bangles

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.980
and got a stone and smashed them up because from now on mum wouldn't be allowed to wear

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:42.980
colourful clothes so I saw a big transition in her clothes and any of her jewellery and

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.780
so she could wear a plain gold bangle and very plain things but she wouldn't be allowed

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:53.420
to have decorations so she always had to dress in white now and that would signify her status

00:20:53.420 --> 00:21:00.420
as a widow and it started our partnership with grief basically so that was the end of

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:09.420
the security we'd known because we'd had four bed roomed house and a big lounge in

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:15.540
the middle and then corridors in the front and the back so it was quite a nice big house

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:22.220
and my side of the family, my mum and dad and my sister and I, we slept on the one side

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:29.220
and my step brother, his wife and four kids were on the other side and it was fine for

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:38.780
a few weeks and then as often happens in the case of widowhood because the father's gone

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:45.780
and you've lost your status, my brother then, Suru, had never really worked and my dad couldn't

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:53.780
get him to work. He liked running the casino, my dad had a casino as well as the business

00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:02.540
and he had a taxi rank as well so he was happy with the casino side of it, gambling machine

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:10.540
but he wasn't really into working with my dad's shops and things on South Street in

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:17.540
Kampala and within a few months he then just left and we didn't even see them go because

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.340
we'd have been really upset, my sister and I and my mother if we'd seen them go but

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:30.980
it was all obviously packed, everything was packed, arranged and we woke up one day to

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:37.860
start our play programme as you know you always have to play or run or catch tiggy or share

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:44.860
the bicycle out and like Chetan and I would ride the bicycle and we'd have these games

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.500
where if it's a Bollywood song, if it's a woman singing I got a chance to go on the

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.460
bicycle but if it's a man singing he had a chance but then if there was three or four

00:22:54.460 --> 00:23:00.140
women singing in a row he would cry so then you know we had to make another rule well

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.900
if it's a man and a woman singing you can have a go then but the youngsters couldn't

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:12.060
get on the bicycle so we'd take them round the yard, our backyard with us, one of us

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:17.420
holding and the other one guiding the cycle well all that went, everything was just gone

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:24.420
and we woke up one day and then gone and there were no way to be seen and my brother and

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.020
my sister-in-law Sila did come back and take us to the cinemas because we always used

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:40.020
to go to open air audience on the weekend but they would never, you know they never

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:47.060
lived there again basically so they were using dad's money basically to rent in town in

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:54.300
Kampala so but they did still come back to take us to the cinema and it was Bollywood

00:23:54.780 --> 00:24:00.780
movies, open air so it was all singing, dancing, happy, always a happy ending and somehow all

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:07.500
the difficulties are overcome and love always triumphs somehow between a man and a woman

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:14.500
but it also became quite evident that women once you've lost your dad and you've not

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:24.980
got a brother who cares for you because the other brother Ratila who had a business sugar

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:31.980
factory in Lugazi and dad had always insisted on education, he was very pro-education and

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:40.860
he had sent my younger of the two brothers Ratila to Germany and India and he'd done

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:48.180
his engineering degree and he'd travelled and then he'd set up this sugar factory and

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:55.740
my dad obviously helped him with all that but he lived in Lugazi so he was never really

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:04.860
close by anywhere apart from family occasions when he'd come and you know it was all,

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:11.860
he was still obviously very much part of the family and what does happen with once you've

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:18.860
lost your dad and your husband is as a woman and especially with brothers who are not interested

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:25.860
in taking care of you or looking after you is you are open to abuse and assault and it's

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:32.940
I'm sorry to say this but it's quite a common thing in the culture so we were extremely

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:39.980
vulnerable but they also, when my step-brother left, said to me, I'm going to go to the

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:47.580
school, my step-brother left, he also took away Francisco, our most trusted male staff

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:54.580
we'd had from when we were small. So now if we wanted somebody, mum had to appoint this

00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:01.540
other staff but he was always drinking and drunk and he would always try and grab us

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:07.220
and so as soon as it got dusky we'd have to lock the doors, we couldn't play in the yard

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:13.700
anymore and he used to keep banging on the kitchen which was at the back and we would

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.700
be curious as two little girls seeing why is he banging, what's happening and we'd

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:25.700
open the wooden shutters and every window had bars on it so for security, metal bars

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:31.860
and he'd be like trying to put his hand through the metal bars to try and grab us and there

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:38.900
was also assaults from the family as well, the extended families but that was, I didn't

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:46.020
realise at the time, I just couldn't believe people were treating me differently and eyeing

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:52.060
me up differently because I was the older of the two and I was beginning to, I was about

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:59.060
you know 11, 10, 11 so I was beginning to turn really and it wasn't even safe to go

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:05.340
and visit the relatives because you could be isolated and assaulted and unfortunately

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:12.340
that was common then as it turned out and I didn't have any awareness of any of that

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:20.740
and then it was frightening but then we had one of the cousins who, my dad had insisted

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:28.540
because the other part, one part of the family actually worked with dad and a lot of the

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:35.540
cousins worked with dad in the shop, he had a trade shop and all sorts of goods he used

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:45.300
to sell in his business and this part of the family, also actually the sons, the cousins

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.500
worked with dad because obviously my stepbrother, Suru, you could never get him to do any work,

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:59.500
he just liked the casino work and running around basically and one of the sons, my dad

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.940
had always said, oh you know because his brother had died so he wanted to make sure he looked

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:11.940
after all the sons and I never met my uncle, Kalyanji, but his sons were, always worked

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:20.780
in the shop with dad and one of the sons, he said I'm going to make sure I pay for

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:27.260
his education and I'm going to make sure, because Ratilal, my own stepbrother, went

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:33.900
to India and Germany and he said I'm going to make sure I help him with his education

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.700
so we've got a doctor in the family so he paid for all his medical training and supported

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:45.700
him to get his medical degree in India and he came back qualified as a doctor but we

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:52.700
were safe then or so we thought and then the other frightening incident that happened

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:59.700
was the military were doing rounds when Idi Amin came up, came into power saying the Asians

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:07.060
are leeching the country and they don't care about you and all this business and the

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:14.060
military were coming round and you'd have a warning to say they're coming so you had

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.060
to make sure, they come with guns, it's not like the military in this country and you'd

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:25.060
have to make sure you had wads of money ready to hand over and once they're banged on the

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:32.060
door you had to open the door and the military were doing rounds and the military was doing

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:39.060
the rounds and Mrs Manick had said to mum just lock your door and stay indoors and can

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:48.740
you get one of your cousins, one of the boys from the extended family to come and spend

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:54.500
the night with you because we knew that night the military were coming. We were absolutely

00:29:54.500 --> 00:30:01.500
petrified and you know don't open the door she said to my mum because she was afraid

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:07.780
I was scared as well because mum could be quite feisty as well, not educated but she

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:14.460
stood her ground, she was quite strong lady in many ways which I didn't appreciate at

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:21.040
the time when I've seen other widows just being kicked about, I didn't realise how strong

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:28.040
mum had been and what it must have took. She'd also been suicidal as well and after dad died

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:36.040
she was so alone and deserted by the family, by all the extended family that one day she

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:43.040
said, I was only a child, I was only something like nine and she said I'm going to kill

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:50.040
myself and we were just at the back area near the kitchen and she started to put, she put,

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:57.040
she stuck her dress, you know her sari with a match and so I cried and cried and I tried,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.680
you know I didn't know what to do so I'd be like flapping at the flames and she kept

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.840
saying that and then she'd come to her mind, she was so depressed and she'd put the fire

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:12.840
out and she'd dab herself down and she burned quite a few of her saris by doing that, the

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:19.840
corners of her saris, her pala and my sister had also witnessed this so she then one day

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:26.440
had also been playing with matches in the back bathroom and she was only between four

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:31.740
and five and then she came out screaming, we were at the back, it was daylight and my

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:37.260
sister came out of the bathroom screaming and crying and I looked at her and the flames

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.840
were on the dress and there was a sink there and my mother was scooping up water from the

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:47.240
sink and throwing it at my sister but it wasn't working, the flames were burning her white

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:53.440
dress and I just didn't know what to do, I mean it was only nine and not seen a fire,

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.440
didn't know what to do and so my mum just said go and ask next door neighbour what to

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:04.680
do so I ran to the man next door and he was in the back yard and I said what do I do,

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:11.680
what do I do, my sister's on fire, throwing water at her isn't working and my mum was

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.920
panicking, I was in a total panic and he said oh lay her down on the ground with the blanket,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.320
wrap it over and just lay her down so I ran back in and I was just screaming get a blanket,

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:28.000
get a blanket, get a blanket so mum went and got a blanket and I grabbed it and I rolled

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.800
her in it and laid her down to put the flames out and then I was just crying and screaming

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:39.240
at my mum then in return and I said, I didn't know how to express myself very well but I

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:44.760
remember saying to her you taught her how to do this, watching you, you taught her,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:51.000
and after that mum never threatened suicide again and I was crying and I said to mum you

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.360
know don't you love us but she never did that again.
