Steve's Stories. My name is Steve Fletcher and in 1990 I founded Swicker Carnival who

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.120
have organised Cardiff Carnival ever since. Steve's Story Number 4. Cardiff Carnival

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.120
Under Attack. Cardiff Carnival's philosophy has always been one of interculturalism and

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.920
inclusion. However, this vision was violently opposed by some in the early days of the carnival's

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.440
history. The first incident of racist attack took place in 1991 and involved Swicker Carnival's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.280
minibus being vandalised while parked overnight in Riverside. Acid was used to etch Nazi swastikas

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.480
and the logo of the far-right racist group Combat 18 on every panel of our poor minibus.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:57.440
The most shocking incident was the knife attack by a bare-chested skinhead on Cardiff Carnival's

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.640
wrapper in residence whilst he was performing on the bandstand in the haze as part of the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.280
Cardiff Carnival finale in 1995. Our wrapper was badly shaken and his shirt slashed wide open,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.240
but he recovered quickly and even managed to continue his set. I helped the special constable

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.360
supporting the carnival to identify the attacker and he was quickly arrested and so I returned to

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.560
the bandstand to ensure the finale continued smoothly. However, the sweaty skinhead was as

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.800
slippery as an eel and managed to break free from the arresting police officers and take off at full

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:44.680
pelt down the haze before skidding behind Jury's Hotel. Sadly, just as the attacker was about to

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.840
be re-arrested, the lead constable, who was not a swimmer, fell into the canal and had to be saved

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.520
from drowning by his colleague. So unfortunately, justice was not served in this instance.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.000
In the early days, the police themselves were ambivalent about Cardiff Carnival. I distinctly

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.840
remember in 1994 a friendly police officer explaining how the penny had finally dropped

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.800
for him when he fully realised that Cardiff Carnival Parade was a massive and joyous celebration on the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.160
road and ought not be policed as some sort of riotous, politically contentious demonstration

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:32.200
or protest. It is to Cardiff Carnival's credit that all those involved withstood any early setbacks

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.120
and misunderstandings, thereby allowing it to grow year by year and become a widely accepted and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:49.160
much loved family event. In short, to become the biggest and brightest collective celebration of Cardiff by Cardiff.
