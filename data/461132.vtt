Well, places like the Rhondda, the Cunning Valley and so on, the effect has been enormous, unquestionably.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Unemployment, once it disappeared, but crumbs did now have an effect on employment.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And of course, with unemployment come the social problems that were inevitable, I suppose.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One friend of mine, for instance, said to me at one time that they should have left one pit open.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Never mind about a rising coal, he said they should have left one pit open.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And then if the youngsters had to get up in the morning to go down the pit, we wouldn't have the nonsense we'd have in the nights on the roads.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I don't know whether that's true or not, I don't know. But certainly that's a view.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It certainly had an effect on social orders, what we say.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And it's still having an effect. And questionably, there are families, I'm told, that are going back two or three generations that haven't had work.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now that's bound to have an effect.
