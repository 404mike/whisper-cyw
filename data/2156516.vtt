00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Today is the 28th of April 2023 and I'm here at the home of Mrs Pauline Walton at Hazelmere,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Hazelmere House, Hazelmere Estate in Rairdale.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Thanks very much for inviting me into your home Pauline and I think we're going to have a very interesting chat from what I can gather.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
First of all, do you mind if I ask you your date of birth?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The 6th of October 1940.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Thank you, thank you very much. Now I understand you're not originally from Rairdale, you're very much a native now, but can you tell me a little bit about your early life?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Yes, I was born and grew up in Clendring de Dwells, down Tremont Road, one of a family of seven children, most of them still alive.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I had a wonderful upbringing in Clendring Dodd because the great outdoors was your playground.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We had the lake in Clendring Dodd and there used to be boating on the lake and lots of different things going on up there and the rock park, which was a wonderful playground.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I attended the local national school in Clendring Dodd and at the age of 11, I passed my 11 plus to go to the grammar school.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I stayed there until I was 17. I didn't stay on for my A levels.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I had to leave because by now my mum and my father had divorced and my mum was bringing up the family on her own.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So I needed to be a breadwinner in the family.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And so I didn't go for further education.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I came and worked for the family.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:08.000
One of the things my sister always tells me that the first new pair of shoes she ever had was when I started work and was able to buy her from Edie's in Clendring Dodd a little pair of red shoes.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
She always reminds me of that.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Later on, I started to work at the Metropole in Clendring Dodd in the reception and had many wonderful years there working with the Baird Murray family.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And they were so kind, so helpful.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They always kept in touch with me.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I stayed there until my first born Christian was born.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And then I had to give it up, intended to go back.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And within 18 months I was expecting my second child Justin, so I didn't go back.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Oh, thank you for that introduction.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Now, let's find out why you came to Reader all those years ago.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The dances in Clendring Dodd were always held at the Rock Park Centre.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
No alcohol, tea, coffee, sandwiches and cakes by two local ladies.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And there was always a live band.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We were very lucky in Clendring Dodd that there was Mr. Samuels and Mr. Sheen.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And they were always on the QE2, I think it must have been QE1 or QE2 liner over to America.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So they learned, they were a band on board the ship.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
They learned all the later songs and everything.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Then when they came back for a rest, they would go down the Rock Park and play.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And I was there as a 16-year-old when a young man, well, young man, Cliff was six years older than me, asked me to dance.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And I looked at him and in those days you didn't see many men in beautiful suits,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
white shirts and tie turned out, you know, they were all a little bit scruffy.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So I turned him down and it wasn't until a year later that I saw him again.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And this time I decided, yes, I would dance with him.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
At the end of the evening he asked me, can I walk you home?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And I said, oh no, I live a long, long way from here.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
It's a long walk. Oh, no problem.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I've got transport.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So we went outside and there was a motorbike and sidecar.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And I said, there's no way that I'm getting, I'm getting him back to go home.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But he encouraged me.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So that was my first time on a motorbike, which actually became one of the stays of our family in later life.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Both my sons and my grandson are all big motorbike enthusiasts.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So that's where I met Cliff.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And then we got married in 1961 and I came to live in Raerder.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Our first home was with Mrs. Woods, the mount.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000
That would be Pam Wood's, Pam Pahl's mother in a little flat, one up, one down, a pound a week.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And it was lovely.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And that's where Christian was born.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
He was born in that first flat.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And then Bringoey came up for sale.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
It had been a children's home for many, many years.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And Cliff loved it, loved the building, loved the look of it.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And Radnorshire District Council was selling it.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So he decided they were asking for offers.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So he's decided he put an offer in.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We talked about it and took a little bit advice.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And four thousand pounds was about the right sort of figure.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Cliff was born on the 19th of September.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So I said, no, I said, don't just put the, bear four thousand, put four thousand and nineteen pounds, which he did.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And he got it.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
As luck would have it at that time, we didn't know what we were going to do with it.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So William Holcro were building the Clwedwg Dam in Llanidloes.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And they'd got all their key workers wanting somewhere to live.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So we quickly turned it round into flats for the workers.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I helped.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And I'm pulling up the floorboards one day.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I found lots of little notes there from the children, from the children's home that they had posted between the floorboards to their parents asking them to come and take them home.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And messages to Father Christmas and things like that.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And that really, really upset me.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So we lived down.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We moved from the mount, moved into Bringui.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And we had many, many wonderful years down there.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
By then, Cliff had built on the tennis court five houses.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And he let some of those to the key workers from Sir William Holcro's and local people.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000
One was John Price, the reporter for the County Times and his wife.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And then we had Mr.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Mrs. Ellis.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And he was a schoolteacher at Brinterion.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And then the others were key workers on the Clwedwg, the work.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Wonderful memories, wonderful times.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
None of Bringui was built then.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Right opposite was a field.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And that was owned by Lluingulam Farm, I think.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
You know, and it wasn't so many, many years later after we left Bringui.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
That that became a building site.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And Bernard Lloyd and his sons built all the houses and the bungalows there.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Well, Bringui in itself has such a fascinating history.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It's a wonderful point that you were part of all that.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Oh, yes.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Now, what exactly brought Cliff's family to this part of the world in the first place?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Because they're certainly not from anywhere near here originally.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
No, no, no.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
They were Northumbrian people from up north.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Grandad had worked for Sir Edmund Nuttall, the engineering firm all over the country for years,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
until they found that they were going to build the Clarewind Dam in the Ellam Valley.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
All the key workers came down to have a look in the bad, bad winter of 1947.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And Dad thought he'd gone to hell. He always told me.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
He said it was so cold.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Anyway, they decided they would take the job on.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And the key workers all came down earlier.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
They were housed locally, some in Dolgurtham,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
some in Nantmadug at the back of the Ellam Valley Hotel, and some in the village.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So Dad then, the family all came with Dad.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Prior to that, they'd been in Trakeen in Carmarthenshire,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.000
where the Admiralty had been building a massive, massive tunnel out into the mountain

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
to keep all the armaments from the Second World War, you know, all the bombs and things.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So they moved up to Raerder and went to live in Nantmadug.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Dad, Clip's first job, my husband, his first job was an apprentice electrician on the Clarewind,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
as many others did.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
They had wonderful, wonderful amount of people.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Where I live now, Hazelmere, was the home of Frank Worthing, and Frank run a bus service.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And he would travel all over Breckenshire, Radnyshire, Montgomeryshire,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000
picking up people, workers, every day to bring in and take up the Ellam Valley to work.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So there were thousands and thousands.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Grandad said the hardest workers up there always was the Irish boys.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
They were absolutely wonderful.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
But he said they were drinkers.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And he said at the end of the month, when it was payday, they would come down into town,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
they would go to Percy Hughes', which is Richard Hughes' father's shop, than grandfathers in town.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
They were gents' outfitters.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
They would buy a new suit, a shirt, a tie, socks.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000
They would disappear over to Llandrindod, to the log cabin, which was at the back of the Commodore Hotel.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
They would spend the weekend there.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000
They'd come back to work on a Monday morning in the same clothes that they'd been in all weekend.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And they would live in those for the next month until payday again.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And so the Hughes' did very, very well out of the workers of the Clairewyn Dam.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000
But they did have, grandad said as a foreman, he wouldn't allow any alcohol on, you know.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And then, of course, they had all those wonderful stonemasons from Italy when they came over

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and they were doing all the front of the dam.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And they were absolutely amazing workers.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So that's really how dad came to Riddar.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
They stayed in Riddar because the oldest daughter started courting a local boy, Henry Bryce.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And Henry and Margaret were talking about getting engaged and getting married.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And Nana Walton, Olive Walton, decided it's time to put down roots.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And so she wanted to buy a place in Riddar out from Nant Naddauk to live.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Dulgerth and Bungalows were all key workers' bungalows for people working on the Clairewyn Dam.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And she decided that when they became empathy, she would like one.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So she went to see the clerk and she said, listen, when they become available, I would like one.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
No problem, Mrs. Walton. How are you going to pay for it?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Is it possible to take it out of Albert's wages every month?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
No, no problem at all.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So the money for buying Six Doll Girth and was taken out of Albert's wages every month.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And he never knew because in those days, they would hand the men, would hand the wage packet

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
complete without taking a penny out of it to the wife.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And the wife looked after the finances.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So that's how they got Doll Girth.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And so the family then settled in Riddar.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
The one son married Shirley Williams from the drill hall.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I married Cliff.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
My sister-in-law, Olive Bennett Evans, married Simon Bennett Evans.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And my other sister-in-law, Margaret, married Henry Price, who had an electrical firm in Llanidlois, a shop in Llanidlois.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000
He also had a little shop in Riddar, where Bob the Butcher's was and now Watson's the Butcher's.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And he decided that it was not doing any good and he was going to give it up.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
By this time, Cliff had left the Clairewyn, was working for Henry as an electrician,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and decided he would take the shop on.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:19.000
He took it on, just working for Henry during the daytime and then doing all the work for the shop in the evenings.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
It soon became obvious that it was too small, that he needed somewhere bigger.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So he bought Paris House in Riddar, which is now where the Chinese takeaway is.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:40.000
That soon became too small and then Kimberley Cafe became available to sell, to buy, sorry.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
So he bought that and built a massive extension, an 8,000 square metre extension on the back.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And this was now when Colour Television came to Riddar.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And that was the making of the business, Colour Television.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Not many people could afford to buy Colour in the beginning, so we would rent and hire Purchase in the beginning.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I can honestly say that most of the televisions in Riddar and the community were from Cliff Shop.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.000
They were so good that Joe tells me some of those televisions in the farms are still going strong today.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
We always went for brand makes. We went for Sony and Toshiba and Itachi.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
They stayed the course and they were wonderful.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Sorry, can I?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Pauline, you've been mentioning quite a few places in the area now.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.000
For the benefit of our listeners, could you just explain how far away the Clioin Dam actually is?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
From Riddar, is it about six miles or more?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I would think about six miles.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Yeah, about six miles from Riddar. In the Ellum Valley, the top end of the Ellum Valley.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Going slightly south-west, isn't it?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
That's right, yes.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
A river going into the Ellum, the Clioin.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And you mentioned the Butcher's Shop. Where exactly is that in Riddar, please?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Next door to the library in South Street, opposite the Ellum Hotel.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
That would be West Street, would it?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Sorry, West Street.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And the Dolgurtham Bungalows, where would we find those?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
In East Street, halfway along.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
The post office on your right-hand side, the Bear Hotel on your left-hand side.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000
The next turning on your left was six bungalows built for key workers, building the Clioin Dam.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And those are called Dolgurtham.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And at the top of that lane is Dolgurtham House itself, which is a sorry sight at the moment,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
because they had a fire there many years ago.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
But it was a beautiful building.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:08.000
The youth club used to be there. All the guide people would be there.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
It was well used, and now it's just empty and looking dreadful.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Very sad indeed.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And Paris House you mentioned, where would we find that?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:29.000
If you go up into North Street, Daisy Powells is next to Cliff Walton & Sons shop, Euronics.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And the next place down to that is Butique in Northbrook.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And next to that is Paris House, and that is now a Chinese takeaway.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Interesting how they all change.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Oh yes, yes.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Now you've mentioned the relationship now between Henry and your husband, Cliff.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.000
I believe they became builders in the area. Can you give us some details about that?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Yeah. Where we live now, Hazelmere House, came up for sale.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And there was a lovely lady, Mrs. Evans, living here with her family.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And she was getting quite elderly, and she wanted to sell.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
So we bought Hazelmere House, and we bought the four fields that were around,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
which are now Hazelmere Estate.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And it was called Hazelmere because the road into Hazelmere House itself,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
a great big hazel, and nut trees growing all on the side of the road,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
and that's why it was called that.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000
But we were the last buildings on St. Harmon Road. Above us there was nothing.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
There was no pen, mace, nothing.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
It was wide open right up to the top of the hill.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
So we bought that, and we came here to live in 1972,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
and Cliff started building on the fields around the house.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Trying to remember how many, 24, 25 bungalows.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Lovely estate, and they were steel-built bungalows then.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
There was no wood inside.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
They were just steel frame, which was, you know, quite innovative in its day in the 1970s.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
So that's how we came to live at Hazelmere.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And I'm still living here.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
But during our time, before we moved to Hazelmere, we bought Brungawee,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
which is now a nursing home in Raerdy in South Street.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And we bought that from Radnor District Council in the late 60s, early 70s.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
And we turned it into flats.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
And on the tennis court, we built some houses on the tennis court.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:06.000
But the key workers for the Cloedeg Dam there in Llanidlois came to live at Brungawee House.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.000
And after we left there, we sold it to Nancy Hickley, who used to run the Ellen Hotel in Raerdy.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And she just lived there with the flats as her home.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Right. If we could just go back to the valley for a couple of minutes.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
You tell me an interesting story about something that Cliff did for a bet.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Are you able to tell us that little story again?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Yeah. He was a young man, apprentice electrician on the Clairewyn.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And it was not long before the official opening.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
And they'd had some water over to try it out.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And then it was shut off.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
And they bet him for £5, would he climb up the centrepiece of the Clairewyn Dam,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
which he did. They used to remind him of that in years to come about him doing it.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Quite an interesting anecdote indeed.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Yeah.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Right. Can you tell us a little bit about how the electrical business that you started grew in Raerdy?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Because it's quite a big concern now.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Yeah. My husband Cliff was an electrician.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
And he worked after the Clairewyn was opened and finished.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
He worked for his brother-in-law, Henry Price, W.H. Price in Llaneddlois.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And it was at the time where not many farms had got electricity in Montgomeryshire over to Aberystwyth, a massive area.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And so that's what he would do.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:52.000
So we got to know a whole area and people in Montgomeryshire and in Ceredigion as well.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:01.000
And so he worked for Henry until Henry had a little place that Mrs. Walton and Anna Walton used to look after,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
where Bob the Butcher's was and now Watson's.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And he used to just have people coming in.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And there were messages, this has gone wrong, that's gone wrong, not so much sales, you know, service shop really.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
And he was going to close it.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And Cliff said, no, don't don't do that. I'll keep it on.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:29.000
So Cliff took it and he noticed that people were wanting much, much more than just servicing.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000
So he started selling appliances out there, washing machines and tumble dryers.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000
And then it was too small. So Paris House came up for sale in North Street.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
That was Mrs. Meredith's, a coal merchant's next door.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
And a little bit of interest because on the side of Paris House, there's a lane,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:02.000
a right of way running right to the back of Paris House into Northbrook next door.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And that's still there today. And that's how they used to bring the coal in.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
So that's up the side of the Crown Hotel.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
And it wasn't much longer before that got too small.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
And Kimberley Cafe came up for sale.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Kimberley Cafe was a wonderful, wonderful building.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:34.000
And in on holiday weekends, there'd be seven, eight mile tailbacks of traffic coming into Rader.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
People from the Midlands being out to the coast for the day.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.000
The first place they would see for somewhere to eat was the Kimberley Cafe in Rader in North Street.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
That was open sometimes until midnight. People would be in there eating.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Anyway, the people who were running that decided they were getting too old and they wanted to give it up.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
So we bought Kimberley and transformed it.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.000
We built a 8,000 meter extension on the back, some flats above the shop.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
And that's where we moved into. That would be what?

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
In the late, in the early 1970s, 1974, 75.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And then it was the Advent Color Television.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And that really made the shop what it is today because everybody wanted color.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
And it was rental. It was HP.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
A lot of people couldn't get a signal locally.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Even an aerial on the roof of a house couldn't get it.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:51.000
So Cliff used to do pipe television and he would go all over Radnyshire, Breckinshire, Montgomeryshire.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:00.000
He would spend days and hours looking for a good strong signal, sometimes on the top of a massive hill.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:08.000
And then he would dig a trench from the top of the hill down to the farmhouse or the dwelling, bring the cable down.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
And that's where they would get that's where they get their signal.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
You know, so easy was that a life today.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
But that was hard work.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
So that's how the business came into being.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.000
And now both my sons and my grandson and my daughter-in-law work for it.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000
And I have to mention Katrina, who came out of school at the age of 16.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.000
She's now 57 and she's still with us in the in the shop, a local girl.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
And we couldn't do without her.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Well, the Walden's van is a very prominent feature, a very prominent vehicle in this area.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
They're forever lasting doing deliveries all over this part of Wales and further out there.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000
So your family will obviously keep it on for years to come, I would imagine.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
I would hope. Yes.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Well, thanks ever so much for telling us about the build up to all these businesses and the interest in the buildings in Raerdyd.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Talking about living now in Raerdyd and bringing up a family in Raerdyd, what changes have you yourself seen in Raerdyd?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Can you point out any specific changes?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
There's so many over the years.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:43.000
The community is not what it was when I was growing up, when I was living in, started to live in Raerdyd.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
And you knew everybody.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:52.000
What I find now, I know I'm getting older, but what I find now, I can go downtown, I can walk the street.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
If there's somebody my age, group fine.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
But the young people, I don't know anymore.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
That wasn't like that in the 1960s, the 1970s.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
You knew everybody on the street.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
You knew their name. You knew their family.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
It was a very close-knit community.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:25.000
And we used to have quite a group of men, about eight or ten men, every day would be on the corner of North South Street there, just standing, watching the world go by.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
And if you wanted to know anything about what was happening, you only had to speak to them.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
A lovely lot of banter with them every time you pass by, being teased.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
But the shops is the theme.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
We had so many shops.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
You didn't need to go out of Raerdyd.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
We had everything in Raerdyd then.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
And Eddie Collard's, the butcher in the centre of Raerdyd.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:02.000
I remember going there on a Saturday, two and sixpence, for a piece of meat for Sunday lunch.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
That would do your Sunday lunch.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:13.000
It would do your Monday meal and sandwiches for the family for a couple of days as well.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
They had some wonderful shops in Raerdyd.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
And now we haven't got them.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Big changes in the town.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Oh, yes. Yes.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Big, big changes.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
And not for the better.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Not for the better.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
This is a beautiful house where you live, Pauline.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Can you give us a few more details about the house, when you think it may have been built, et cetera?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Yeah, I think Hazelmere was built by Bowen Hamer, who was, I don't know whether he was an accountant or a solicitor.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
And he ran a business from here.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
There was a building out in the yard and he ran a business from here.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
But he dealt mainly with farmers.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
And later on, he started selling animal feeds as well from the building.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
He built it and he lived here with his family.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And I don't know what happened.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
I was told he went bankrupt.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
But anyway, the house was sold.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
And I think Birmingham Corporation bought it.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
They put one of the engineers for the dam.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Whether it would be the first dam, must have been the first dam, I should imagine.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
I don't know the name of the engineer.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
They lived here.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
There were a couple of owners over the years.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Then Mrs. Evans was a housekeeper to Mr. Thomas, who had bought Hazelmere.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Mr. Thomas was from the Kashanth family in Raider.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
And he lived here.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
He was a bachelor.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
And Mrs. Evans was his housekeeper.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
When he died, he left the house to her.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:11.000
And in turn, when Mrs. Evans was wanting to move, she left the house to my husband, Cliff.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Cliff, in turn, then, involved his brother-in-law, Henry Price, in the buying of Hazelmere in the beginning.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Because there was a lot of land involved.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
There was a couple of acres, about three or four acres, all around the house,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
which they started to develop as a housing estate, Hazelmere estate.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
And then Cliff bought the house outright for us to live in.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:47.000
And that was in 1972, 1973.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
And that's when we came here to live in Hazelmere.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
We've been here ever since.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Beautiful place, beautiful setting.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Again, very interesting history of the house.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
You were mentioning the first dam before.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Would that be the Cabin Cook Dam?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Yes.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
The first one we see going up in the valley.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
What do you do for entertainment in Raider, then, Pauline?

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
How do you relax?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
We're very lucky, really.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:27.000
We have Callard, which has always got something going on in Raider to get involved with and to visit.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
I'm a big supporter of the Wives side in Bilth Wells.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
They have some very good do's there.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Now the Pavilion in Llandrindod has got some wonderful venues there.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
And also Theatre Brechenog in Brecon I go to a lot.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
But in town, I belong to the WI.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
As I'm getting older, I don't do as much as I used to.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
I joined the WI in 1972.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
The chairman at that time was the president at that time was Maisie.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
It was Maisie, no, I don't know who the president was then.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
But the secretary was Maisie Andrews, the garage.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
And the secretary was Maisie Williams, the drill hall.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:24.000
And it was Maisie who was mother to my sister-in-law, who involved me in the WI.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
And it wasn't long before I became WI president.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:38.000
And except for bringing up my daughter, who was born in 1981, I've been a lifelong member.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
I had a few years off bringing up my daughter.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
But if you want to know what's going on in the vicinity, join the WI.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Well, you've obviously had a very happy and productive life.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
You've been a big influence in the community of Raerdyr.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
So thank you very much for sharing all of your experiences

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
and giving us a lovely idea of the history of Raerdyr and the neighbouring Ellyn Valley.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
So thank you again.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Thank you.
