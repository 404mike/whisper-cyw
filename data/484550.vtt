00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.200
Interviewer Steve Fletcher.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.000
Interviewee Jason Laude.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.640
The venue is the Swicker office.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.920
The date today is Friday the 21st of November 2014.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.320
Jason, would you be kind enough to spell your name in full for the record?

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.520
My name in full Jason Windsor Laude.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.760
J-A-S-O-N-W-I-N-S-D-O-R-L-A-W-D-A-Y.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.280
Thank you very much for that.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.080
Jason, how did you first get involved in Cardiff Mars Carnival?

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.640
Well I was used to live in Cardiff.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.880
I was working as a graphic designer in those days

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.240
and a friend of mine Babs was involved in the Carnival of 1991.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.920
Encouraged me to come along.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.360
So I sort of came along, had a look around

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.760
and started helping out with making the costumes.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.520
But I was also a musician as well and I got

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.080
sort of roped into one of the bands in the Carnival with Peter Stacey.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.640
The band he formed then went on to continue after the Carnival.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.120
It was called Peep a Drum, Pipe and Drums.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.040
And there was me and Steve Singh, Kalp and George Whitfield.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.920
We played in rag costumes in the Carnival but on the actual day.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.080
So we were practicing that during the day times.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.720
And also I was helping Amaru Chittawa to do his section of the Carnival.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.000
So I sort of got involved.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.360
I remember the first sort of day I met up with Amaru.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.600
And it was like on a Friday and he was showing me to do some stuff

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.360
and he was going to go back to London for the weekend

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.200
and he left me to get on with some stuff over the weekend.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.200
I just got right into it.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.720
I was there whole of Saturday, whole of Sunday.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.440
When he came back on Monday morning I'd done it all and he was quite amazed.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.360
And from that point on we got on really well.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.920
And so subsequent years I tended to work more with him

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.760
on his section of the Carnival because we sort of got on really well.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.360
And yeah, he was quite an inspiring person to work with

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.520
and interesting designs and everything.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.240
Yeah, so the first time we went down to Bute Town,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.200
marching down the streets I remember all the samba bands and the steel pan.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.200
Were you playing flute?

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.320
I was playing flute, yeah.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.680
I was playing flute then but Peter Stacey was playing bagpipes at the time.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.800
I'd never really sat down with anybody playing bagpipes.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.920
We were playing traditional Welsh tunes but it brought it into a different sort of life,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.920
playing on the pipes and things and the way we were doing it.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.920
So that sort of inspired me to get some pipes and I've been playing pipes ever since now.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.920
These are Welsh bagpipes?

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.920
Yeah, Welsh and all sorts.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.680
Oh yeah, reeds of any sort.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.160
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.440
Three shape and size.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.360
And I'm playing semi-professionally now,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.720
playing pipes and flute in various bands and I've been abroad playing and things.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.760
That little seed that was planted those years ago has grown into a big part of my life now.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.760
It's interesting that you mentioned Piba Drum because of course

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.680
the interculturalism which is in Swicker's name was there from the onset, wasn't it?

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.800
Absolutely.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.000
Steve Singh was playing the massive Punjabi traditional drum, the dohlak.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.640
Yes, very much so.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.800
Did he have it taped on, there was a point at which he evolved his own approach to it,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.880
which was rather than playing it two-handed, he sort of taped on withies to one hand and he looked

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.320
like sort of a single-handed Freddy Krueger or something, didn't he?

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.080
Yeah, he was doing some quite fancy stuff there.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.240
It was great, the combination of that rhythm with the pipes as well.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.200
I think it worked really well.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.720
I can hear it in my head even now.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.160
Yeah, and they were just, we did a mixture of Punjabi tunes but also primarily Welsh

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.240
tunes as well and it really sounded great because I was used to, my father was in

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.000
folk musician as well and folk performer and I'd grown up with the Welsh tradition and found it

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.440
a little bit cheesy and tired and that new fresh approach with a bit of other influences coming in

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.680
sort of brought it into real life, it was great. Yeah, and I kept in touch with Peter and we

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.600
see each other every now and then. We played some music together as well since then.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.280
That's extraordinary, isn't it?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.400
Yeah, yeah, it is.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.080
Oh, nice years.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.120
Yeah.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.520
So that was the second ever Cardiff Mars Carnival.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.520
The second ever, I remember going down to Bute Town and yeah, the big march down to Bute Town

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.160
and then into the Bute Town Carnival and then I remember I'd been going to the Bute Town Carnival

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.520
for quite a few years so they all get a bit blended into one so I can't remember who was

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.600
playing there. I remember seeing Aswan there and musical youth and people like this and

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.280
at that time down the docks was a bit of a different place to what it is now.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.800
Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, I've seen to that, haven't I?

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.640
Yes.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.560
I remember the Bute Town riots and everything.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.200
You know, great community down there and great fun on the day and, you know,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.680
good support from everybody along the route and everything.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.640
Yes, very warmly received. And we had good weather, I think.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.680
Yeah, really sunny, great, great, great time, you know.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.880
I think your costumes, which were sort of, as you say, based on rags, were

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.600
a carnival interpretation of a sort of raggedy Welsh tradition from Pembrokeshire.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.080
Yeah, there's rag costumes right through the British Isles, really, and certainly it's in

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.960
in the Welsh tradition, part of the Morris tradition and stuff like that, you know, so it's

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:23.080
coming from there, you know. Yeah, it was great. That was the first year then and the end of that

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.040
year I actually moved away from Cardiff up to the countryside, up into the mountains and I'd had

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.960
enough of the city, you know, and I had enough of working in an office and things and I went up

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.200
and started working, doing conservation work and got a job with the National Trust and,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.080
you know, my lifestyle changed quite a bit, but I still made the point of coming back to Cardiff

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.920
and getting involved in the carnival because, you know, I really wouldn't miss it for the world,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.800
you know, so I'd take time out and come down for a good couple of weeks during the carnival and

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.880
for the subsequent years right up to 95 and getting more and more involved into it.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.920
Working more closely with Amaru and even also Amaru would come down and visit me and we'd work on

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.400
costume designs and stuff, you know, six months beforehand and so we'd get stuff together and

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.320
we were working quite closely those years, you know. I think he was very impressed from the onset by

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.080
your making skills and you must have built up quite a skill set, I mean, from that. Yeah, I did,

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.640
you know, it was, I'd never used withies before, you know. And you know why they're called withies?

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.840
No, actually. Because withies we're going to make something. All right, okay. Sorry, I thought I'd

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.200
just get the company joke on record there. Okay, okay. Thank you for laughing. That's a good one.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.280
Thank you for laughing with me. Yeah, that's my kind of you. Well, that's the two main things,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.240
is withies and gaffer tape. Yes. A few pictures. The DNA of carnival life. Yeah, I think just about

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.840
most of the pictures that are of me, you can see some gaffer tape about me somewhere for emergency

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.480
use, you know, because with each of the carnivals I'd never actually worked on my own costume and I

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.040
just got into whatever was spare at the end, you know, on the day of the carnival. It shows

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.080
the generosity of spirit, you know, facilitating other people rather than, it wasn't all me, me, me.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.680
No, no, it's never about that. I just love being involved in it and all the different characters

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.000
you'd meet and the things that you make, you know. Yes. I mean, there's a massive social side to it,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.520
isn't it? I mean, it's like a mini village of creativity, I would say. Yeah, absolutely. It's

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.120
really interesting. And you meet people from all walks of life as well, you know. Absolutely, yeah.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.080
You know, which is fantastic. Yeah, you know, walks of life from Cardiff and beyond, you know,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.680
there's people from all over Brazil and, you know, the Caribbean and everything. Yes, quite internationalist

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:30.760
intercultural. You know, great fun. So after the first one in 1991, what was your next carnival

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:38.120
step? Yeah, I came back for the next one. I kept in touch a bit with Amaru and I said that I'd

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.720
definitely be there. So I came along and it was the following year then we were in, just looking at

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.240
the list now, Ninian Park Primary School. It was a bigger school again and the carnival seemed a bit

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.520
bigger again. There's more people involved and there was Sam Alexander, José Angela, the Brazilian

00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.760
contingent come along and they were doing a bit of capoeira and Brazilian dancing and... Maracatu.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.240
Maracatu, you know, the, yeah, Adrian and everybody bringing in maracatu drumming.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:14.200
Great fun. And there was also Mrs. Douglas with her cooking was there as well. Yes, it was. I think

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.880
the problem about the Mascam was location wise, it wasn't close to any local shops. So whilst

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:26.200
people could prepare and bring food, what we decided that year was to involve Ina Douglas,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.480
who lived in Riverside and actually had a sort of, I think it was called a pop-up cafe now.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:37.080
Yeah. But do you remember the dumplings? I was just going to say there's dumplings the size of that

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.920
and you just go back into the room and you'd be holding a stuff and you just go Mrs. Douglas,

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.720
Mrs. Douglas, Mr. Douglas, yeah. Yes. You know, the dumplings. This is Douglas and the dumplings.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.680
The dumplings, yeah. Oh yeah, fantastic, great, great food, really nice, proper Caribbean food,

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.360
probably the first time I'd ever eaten Caribbean food and, you know. You're probably still

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.120
digesting it now. Don't get enough of it, that's for sure. Not in Fandai though. No, no.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:12.200
Yeah, so that year, yeah, there was more of a Brazilian element that year and I was, yeah,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.960
crashing out down at Adrian's place. Did you get a bed or were you having to sleep on the floor?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:24.840
I was on the sofa. On the sofa, you were on it. Yeah. Right. Yeah, so that was when I got to know

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.240
Adrian pretty well but then, you know, we were sort of more involved in the actual making

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.960
side of things and I remember making a lot of pom-poms that year as well, helping with the

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.560
pom-poms. A lot of people, if anybody was spared, they would just make a pom-pom. Yeah, pom-pom

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.960
factory. Yeah. I forget which of the indigenous people who were doing the trade were pom-pom

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.160
based. I don't know. I do remember a lot of pom-poms that keep going on, quite frankly.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.360
And I sort of, you know, yeah, I'd never known how to make them but now I do.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.480
Do you still wake up screaming? Mountains of pom-poms, yeah.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.960
Yeah, so that was that year and then following that we went into Coté's Community Centre,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:09.000
wasn't it? Yes. And yeah, then it was just getting more intense every year so I spent

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.600
more time with Mara working beforehand on costume designs and then when it came to the actual

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.320
camp, I'd be staying quite late because what tended to happen was that a lot of people would

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.680
come in the day and you'd be just helping, you'd be going around in circles just helping people

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.840
make stuff. You wouldn't be working on anything specific yourself, you know, you'd be helping

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.120
other people all day so the only time you get to work on something more complex or something that,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.160
you know, you needed to work on yourself would be in the evening, later on in the evening. So I tend

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:45.400
to work late, stay late and actually sleep in the centre. Right. You know, take the sleeping bag and

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.360
just crash out on, there was loads of pads of foam and you could make some comfy beds there.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.160
You sort of nested, would you? Yeah, yeah, you know, I'd go back to, you know, to whoever's

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.080
place I was crashing out at the time and every now and then but most of the time it'd be in.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.720
That's real dedication, it's fabulous. Yeah, but it was also a magical time, you know, you can imagine

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.720
late at night when it might be only one or two of you in there and you might be trying to get to

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.120
sleep and it's all, it's been frenetic through the day and then you're just sort of lying there and

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.440
you're suddenly aware of all these mad costumes all around you and this strange place. In the half

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.520
night. Yeah, in the half light. Absolutely. Still, strange creakings and rustlings where things are

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.960
settling and with ease of bending and, you know, that was quite magical as well on its own and then,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.520
you know, come the morning you'd have a little bit of time to get some things together and then

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.320
the next rush would start. Yes, yes. And people would come to you with their own ideas of what

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.560
they wanted to do but not really the technical ability to think it through so you sort of get

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.360
them together and get them to make stuff but I would make up, you know, one-off things for

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.400
people as well, you know, certain, I remember doing like a crow head with somebody with a snapping jaw

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:57.800
on it which was quite sort of complex so I did that for them myself, you know. Yeah, yeah. And

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.200
there was, you know, there were other sort of daily things going on, there was kids coming in

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.360
that wanted to just mess around and other faces painted and stuff and you, you know, not necessarily

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.680
part of the carnival that day but you sort of help out and entertain them and yeah. It was,

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.640
no, it was very much a libertarian sort of drop-in approach. Yeah. You know, I've had other interviews

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.360
saying, the view-ees who've gone on to build up a massive skill set and the rest of them saying,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.960
you know, Kate's my first joint, the first thing I liked was the fact that, you know, after school

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.600
the mums would turn up with a four-pack of Stella and we'd be smoking our fags whilst working the

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.480
glue guns. Yeah, yeah. Obviously health and safety and things have changed since then. Yeah. It had

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.880
a very, it was coming from a different place in a way. Yeah, absolutely. And you had these different

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.360
sections in the room as well and very different approaches to stuff, you know. Was there a degree

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.120
of internal competition between you? Yeah, there was always an element of that although, you know,

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.320
I always found that, you know, I get on with anybody anyway, you know, there's probably more

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.320
competition with perhaps the, you know, the bigger personalities in the thing, you know. I just kept

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.600
my head down and got on with the work but it was always good fun to see what other people were

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.400
coming up with and their own sort of vision of, you know, whether it's going to be more sort of

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:09.800
futuristic or, you know, or more traditional carnival style or something else altogether.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:15.400
Certainly in 94, I remember we, because the route and the way in which the finale

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:22.520
has been staged has changed over the 25 years of the Cardiff Carnival and of course back then

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:29.720
we finished the parade and put on a performance which varied in terms of its formality or

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.680
informality on the steps of the National Museum of Wales. Absolutely. With pyrotechnics as well.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:41.160
Yeah, fake blood. Fake blood, oh gosh. Shall we tell the question, do you want to tell a fake blood story or shall I?

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.040
You may know it better than me but it was angels and devils, wasn't it? Yes, yes it was and I sort

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.960
of remember the dance, you know, because there was dance routines worked out as part of the

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.000
whole thing and yeah they were dying on the steps there and using fake blood and...

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.800
Because we've done a test thing we did because the last thing you want to do, I used to sign

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.440
an indemnity with the National Museum of Wales that we wouldn't do anything to the fabric of

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:11.080
the building which you know is a national treasure by definition. Unfortunately in that year

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:20.120
somebody over enthusiastically and deliberately decided to on the day not go with a mix that

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.120
would agree that we knew we could wash out and wouldn't stain and come the day the the blood that

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:33.720
was in the pump action water pistols that shotguns, the pump action water shotguns that the devils had

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:41.240
to drench the white angels was mixed to a double or triple at the strength that we'd agreed upon

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.640
and to my horror the next day when I went back I discovered we had died the steps of the National

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:53.560
Museum of Wales. I of course was summoned to the director's office and the indemnity was

00:14:53.560 --> 00:15:02.200
waved in my face. Fortunately it was a gentleman in that who understood how carnival aspires to

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:08.760
many things and occasionally rules are broken accidentally or even deliberately and gave me

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:15.320
six months leeway to see whether or not Welsh weather would actually take the stain out and I

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.400
remember going back on a regular basis and about three months in discovering that the red had turned

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:27.320
to a light purple and at the end of six months it had actually gone and I was so relieved because

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:38.120
the idea that we could that a small publicly funded arts organisation could somehow make

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:43.160
good the damage to the steps of the National Museum of Wales was impossible. I mean you know

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.960
we would have had to close as it were so it was a good day when I marched up there and discovered

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.720
that the stains had finally gone thank God. Well you can praise the Welsh weather for that that's

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.160
for sure. No absolutely I mean I won't even talk about acid rain.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.360
Yeah so you know and the carnival route would change a bit every year as well even going

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.560
through town and you know and ending up at the castle and everything. So whilst you started it

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.520
as a musician in the first one. That musician well like my friend got me involved just to come and

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.640
help out making stuff and then I found that the band was happening as well and they said oh you

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.680
know if you're a musician do you want to help you join in with us and so I did you know so

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.480
yeah it was a mixture of making. But then I suppose you very much became a maker.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.920
Occasionally I'd go to see him and then he'd come down to see me and you know we'd go walking in

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.840
the mountains you know and his kids would come up as well I took them caving and things you know.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:50.040
Wow. So yeah we had you know a good relationship worked on some great designs and things

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.440
and you know the sort of the last year I worked there there was a bit of a falling out there

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.920
with Amaru and he sort of pulled out at the last minute and then it was on the day of the launch

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.960
of the carnival. All sort of down to me then you know and well you know not me but you know

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.040
we all had to pull together to keep to pull it off. Yes of course. I'm sure you had to

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:16.040
your game personally. Yeah absolutely. But you know we were all we'd all been working together

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:23.480
for years you know anyway and it you know we came together as a team anyway and you know I had all

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.800
the designs and things and Amaru was still supportive in the sort of background you know

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.520
in his encouragement you know he wanted it to go ahead. Yes. You know he was sorry he wasn't there

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.240
he did turn up on the day. Yes. You know and I saw him there and he was you know really happy

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.000
with the costumes and loved to see it. It was a shame he wasn't there and it was but it was very

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.840
intense again. Yes. Pulling all that together you know. Now that did include a rather spectacular

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.880
elephant. Oh yeah it was a big elephant two-man elephant that was one thing I'd be sort of working

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.360
on late at night to try and get that together and I thought you know I didn't think it was going to

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.880
take as long as it did but it came off okay it was like a sort of bamboo and witty frame

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.680
with a sort of life-size elephant with two-man elephant

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.880
a lovely painted head and you know little eye slits and things.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.800
Come the evening of the carnival there was two guys came in they looked fairly sort of beefy and

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.040
said right do you want to be in this elephant then oh yeah fine they got in there and they went off

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.520
but they had shorts on and they were just their little legs sticking up and the trainers you know

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.560
we didn't sort of do elephant legs as well but you know with all the other people around you

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.880
just see the top of the elephant floating through so it was fine but we've just looked at a picture

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:42.280
where in fact you can see that yeah you can see beautiful beautiful very realistic wrinkly skinned

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:47.480
twinkling eye yeah you know but trunks and beautifully-eared elephant and they're sticking

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:52.440
out at the bottom and these two two sets of little human legs with the with trainers on which are

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:58.440
sweet in a way i have to say the ears were flappable and oh god they were kinetic yeah so it was um the

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.320
frame was lowered down so they could hold it in their arms but we also had straps as well so their

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.200
arms were a bit free and part of the deal was that they had enough beer to keep them going so we

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.920
strapped beer inside the elephant there so excellent outside of the public they could actually

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.560
they did complain a bit of every eventuality yeah because that you know i thought well they're

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.680
going to be stuck inside that and they were going to miss a lot of things because they couldn't

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.520
really see what was going on they needed hydrating obviously yeah and the artist jack

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:29.320
and jack armstrong yes jack sullivan sullivan yeah gone i'm thinking of them um jack sullivan

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:34.520
yeah yeah he um sort of took charge of leading them around yes you know and he was uh he loved

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.360
the elephant and he led them around the whole parade it's worth mentioning that jack sullivan

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:46.920
the local artist and painter actually produced a number of artworks um that you know of swicker

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.920
the carnival camp the parades and the rest of it sadly he's no longer with us but uh

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:57.080
i hope in the future those those pictures are picked up and yeah you know i've got one myself

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.920
you know and i'm sure there's more around and the sketches you know he was lightning sketches

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:08.440
oh gosh he was there i always seen with in my mind side with a pad in his hand yeah yeah have

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.360
you still have you got access to them are they around i have made a mental note that i'm going

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.680
to try and do this for the exhibition of the carnival story because again that's that's

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.680
i think it would be worth doing yeah yeah absolutely and he did other you know he did

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.200
paint he would come back i remember the following year he would he would do a painting of the

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.760
carnival wouldn't he yes from the sketches he would come back so it was like a full-blown

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.720
yeah sort of color type of thing of what happened the year before and he'd even capture an individual

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.600
face yeah yeah there you are jason yeah well that's yeah that's you over there in your t-shirt or your

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.640
your yellow reflective hyphids hyphids yeah but there we are yeah a great man yeah

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.240
and a great man of you know the history of cardiff in general you know oh yes and i've

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.040
been a policeman down the docks when it was tiger bay and could tell you stories of all sorts

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.320
yeah in fact to be honest with you he was also in the british army and fought against the

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:05.080
mao mao in kenya so uh there's stories there that uh will come out at a later date

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:13.000
so that was 95 we've been 95 yeah the dog sort of gets a bit confused in my memory as to you

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.400
know because we were at katay's quite a while then and uh yeah so the memories blend in to each other

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:25.480
being in being in there but uh yeah but but by this time i i i yeah i think of you as being

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:31.960
very much of a part of the swicker family and uh yeah and carl of carnival was the mainstay but

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:38.600
of course swicker has always done other projects throughout the year and you got involved in the

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.920
finale event uh for the sunday evening for the i think it was the first or second beyond the

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:50.280
border storytelling festival at saint donald's atlantic college in the vale of the morgan

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.520
what can you remember about that what was that experience that was fantastic as well it was um

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.200
i'd never been to saint donald's before i'd heard about the storytelling festival but i didn't think

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:04.200
it was be my cup of tea you know um but saint donald's atlantic college a fantastic venue

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.960
you know beautiful old you know castle by the sea in a little valley with a lovely big green

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:15.400
fields around here lovely you know sea views and cliffs there and uh you know i was lucky enough

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.800
to be there for two weeks with access to the swimming pool and lovely hot sunny weather

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:26.520
um i was working with with adrian then to do music the music element of it elephant

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.640
yeah music element of it but i was also helping with some of the costume building

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.680
and we had uh as we were there's a main sort of campsite at the top

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:47.320
where we had uh some big tents up there we've had costumes in there and costume building in there and

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:54.360
on-site caterers as well uh mad on-site caterers and um yeah as i say we would just be down

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.080
wandering around the castle and stuff and then working on music building costumes and working

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.680
on how we were going to do this performance as well because it was all quite spontaneous and in

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:11.240
uh organic the way it came together i think it was based on the one of the ancient irish epics of lu

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.960
luke of the shining arm yeah shining arm and his magic spear and all the rest yes you're

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.640
not saying the eye of balor yeah yeah gothy was there setting fire to things as usual yeah there's

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:28.840
gothy there was um you know fire labyrinths um and a strange story with strange sounds being projected

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:36.200
through and stilt walkers and um yeah and dancers all around the place because the actual performance

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.400
was at one end of the what was the jousting field um but the performance was going on around to the

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:47.080
sides as well and converging on the main main thing there yes um because the storytelling

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.440
festival was generally quite quiet sort of festival because there's different storytelling things

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.520
going on and obviously everything else had to end before the performance happened so there was

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:59.560
explosion of everybody who was there it just came yeah so there was a you know big audience

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.760
lovely weather throughout and the evening was lovely warm weather and it's interesting that

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:10.840
that one-off performance led us to swicker to develop a purely professional piece not a community

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:16.920
piece of work called invasion of the soul which um again looked at that interpreted the same story

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:23.080
though in a different format um and actually toured it only got three performances it played

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:31.080
carniv bay it played narbeth and it played uh carnav and castle in north wales so it's amazing

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:36.840
how these things yeah emerged and it's great to remember yeah where they came from yeah yeah

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.640
absolutely um you know and working on the music as well we were trying out different instruments

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.880
and whether we're going to go more percussion or whatever and we built sort of mad trumpets

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:51.480
out of bits about you know yeah sort of scrap scrap instruments stuff just colorful mad scrap

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.600
things and uh yeah so we ended up doing a fair bit of drumming there was a few musicians there

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.720
not not too many it was just enough yeah um and i remember practicing up in the big field and it

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.520
was around the same time that saint athens air show was on and we had the red red arrows doing

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.000
air displays over the top of us when we were practicing the drumming you know i was practicing

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.800
my eyes open looking at these red arrows flying over in formation oh wow that's a

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:21.560
trail of smoke coming through wow wow that was a good one i always say carnival i'm particularly

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:28.200
in carnival camps um yeah all human life is there yeah um would it be true to say that during the

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:34.840
course of a carnival camp you met somebody who was to be significant in later yes yes well uh yeah i

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:40.920
met my who was to become my wife vicki um she was actually there at the second year i was i was there

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:46.840
at uh me and park primary school i remember meeting her there through another mutual friend

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:53.560
janette hodgson um and i remember meeting her but she was working on a different section um i'm

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.880
trying to think whose section she was working on i can't remember now um but i remember you know

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.960
distinctly remember meeting her there but um we didn't actually get together for a few years

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.920
after that and we sort of uh through janette i used to sort of go and crash at janette's place

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:13.400
sometimes during the carnival and uh and we sort of met then and we got together and after about a

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:20.840
year of uh courting uh hey it's wonderful it's great we got together and uh yeah she eventually

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.400
moved up to west wales to live with me and we got we did get married in the end after living

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:30.680
