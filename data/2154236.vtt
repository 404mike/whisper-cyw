Another thing we used to do down the park, we'd get an old box, pull it apart

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.940
and we'd use that as a sledge down that grassy bank and we'd literally wear the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.720
bank to an awful yellow color. We'd kill the grass altogether. Do you remember that?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.540
Yeah, I was too big to do that.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.540
Too big? Oh I wasn't.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.540
Yeah, but I remember it. I mean we went sledging you see in Cumtaitha.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.540
Where in Cumtaitha did you say?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:41.540
Where Llauhtlan. Behind the church, there's a field there with a jump in the middle, a ditch running across it.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.540
And that used to be one and then the other one was the field above Llauhtlan.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.540
And you sledged down into Llauhtlan and so on and so on until you could get across that field which was flat.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.540
You climbed down the bank from what's another place on the top? Glance Earth.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.540
You climbed up the hill to Glance Earth and then sledged down.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.540
Right.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.540
And the other place that I think of we used to do it down the lane from Glance Earth.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.540
Hello, how are you? Would you like to sit down?

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.540
Oh heaps, here please. Yeah there's millions. Photographs everywhere.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.540
Yeah.
