understanding and signing

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:23.340
of the fiber â€”

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.100
the

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.820
Mars

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:41.820
How spirit-cowd, for here we go, Our path to our dismay.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:53.820
We watch as for the day's rainbow, Up in the braving shade.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:04.820
How glory spirit, how for all, Sweet on the battle plain,

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:17.820
How great the thorns, how tyrant most, And tears are shed like rain.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:29.820
O, how lovely, how sweet, how, Alleluia, see far,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:42.820
How bright red, how your hair is brown, O, how tenderly we bow.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.820
Alleluia, watch ahead.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.820
Come o'er the moor kend.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.280
Whereas, how quickly, in a sudden calm, Prove his

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.820
Come o'er the moor kend.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:10.820
Williams in it, one.
