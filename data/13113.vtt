This must have been in the mid-70s, and he said to Mary, his wife, we are going there

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.200
to start a business.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.040
So he went there and opened up this shop in what later became Swellen Street, whether

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.600
it was named after him, I never discovered, but...

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.200
And there they opened the shop and worked very hard.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.680
I do remember my mother telling me that the first few weeks were dreadful.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.040
They had no response at all.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.720
Hardly anyone came into the shop or anything like that.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.720
And then suddenly they started coming and it opened up.
