00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
I don't know, I mean I just marvel at human nature and the survival instinct, you know, that despite

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.360
everything that people go through they still have something within them that needs them to move

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:25.280
forward, to adapt and to continue and to move on. So you know that in itself is quite impressive.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.000
Well I think there's a couple of things. I mean we were lucky that Jamaat Khana was very important

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.880
and we had somebody from our Jamaat Khana that would come and pick us up on a Friday. And I

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:49.480
think having that link to our community, just being able to pray, I think in all of my life,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.760
in all of the the biggest challenges that I've had in my life, the opportunity to silence your

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:08.640
mind and pray with a group of people with whom you have a sense of belonging,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:17.560
I think has been a very powerful thing for me in terms of just helping me rationalize,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.160
re-energize and just think differently about certain things. I was still studying, I was still

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.200
only 16 but this was like the big wide world that I hadn't entered, you know, being so restricted.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:40.560
But I was making money and I was able to, when I turned 17, pay for my own driving lessons and I

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.280
was able to buy my own car and that really changed the face of our lives, you know,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.200
certainly for my parents because then I was able to take them very easily to community events,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.360
community functions, to weddings, to other things. So now they had a much stronger sense of belonging

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:09.720
than they had before. So that was great. There was nobody to talk to. We just got on with it.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.000
We had to. I think you develop a certain amount of resilience, you know, when you've had the kind

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.840
of experience that our family has, you have to have a certain type of experience. You know,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.840
we didn't have people to talk to, we didn't have, you know, anybody that would put their

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.440
arms around us and say it's going to be all right. No, we just had to deal with it. That's what it was.
