00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When you were a kid and your parents, how was growing up and what were your parents like?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Oh, well, I had a bit of a saddish growing up because when I was about, I'd say, eight, eight years old, something like that,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
my mother had a nervous breakdown and remained in hospital for a good few years. So it was my father that was bringing me and my brother up.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That must have been hard.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Yeah, it was hard for my father. As a matter of fact, my father was my brother's stepfather because my mother had been married to her first husband and had my brother.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And then later on she had me, but in them days after we'd so long for a divorce. And when my mother did get divorced, she married my father.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But she'd already had me then. So there was a serious difference between me and my brother.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And that's when, you know, we did live here in the bay, me going to St Mary's School and my brother.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But, you know, I more or less grew up with my father, the two of us up. So later on, I did go down with my aunt and uncle to live with me and my brother.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Where was that then?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So, you know, I had a happy childhood, you know, going to St. Louis School. I went to live with my aunt and uncle at the age I was just getting on for 12.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I was 12 years old in February. But until then, because my father had been called to see when 1939, the war broke out.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And he was taken away and was left with a good friend of ours that was living in the house.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And which my father left me in charge, you know, the lady who took care of me, because my brother was working then.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And that had happened. My father, I don't think he was out to sleep for long when he was taught pedo twice.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And my father ended up as prisoner of war.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Yeah, people forget merchants seeming were prisoners of war.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Oh yes, well then, my brother, I'll tell you about, he lost his life. My brother Freddie, on his first trip to sea during the war,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:06.000
he was so intent on getting on a ship, which he joined with my cousins, the brother, the son of my aunt and uncle I was living with.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The two of them joined the ship with my cousin, which was my aunt's son, even my brother.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000
There was only a day's difference between their birthdays. 17 years old, and my brother was so intent on going to sea.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
My cousin, who was with him, he'd already done, I think, a trip or two.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But when they joined the ship, put the docks here, my cousin asked my brother to come off the ship, because it was like an old boat, he said.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And of course, this was like the war was raging then.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And my cousin came off and my brother stayed on the ship and it was torpedoed. My brother was lost at sea.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It was only that they hadn't even been out. I got all the details of the ship, where it was sunk, the German submarine that torpedoed them.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I have three megalos for my brother. So he was lost, because he'd already left what we call a denudation allotment for my aunt, for somebody to take care of me.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But we never even drew the first allotment. I remember the telegram came in my name to my aunt's house.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I think I was 15 then, or 14. And the telegram came to me, because I was his next of kin, to say that they were missing at sea, presumed dead.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And I got all the particulars here about the sinking of my brother's ship.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And there was also a boy that was in my class. He was only 14, because he was in my class and my brother was three years older than me.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And he went down on the ship with my brother. And another boy, a good friend of my brother's, they were both learning to play the guitar.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I have a picture here of them, it said going on the Woodson Street. And that friend of his, he was on the ship as well.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So there were three, you know, from my school that went down on that ship. I think it's our hill.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I mean, that's the thing, people don't get it. Yes, people went to war in the army, but you could be 14 and die on the merchant. You couldn't be 14 and join the army.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Yeah, I've got a list of all the people that went down on that ship, on the SS Whitestone.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Also, I've been to Tower Hill and seen the plaques. And yeah, it's sad that most of the men were from Cardiff that went down on that ship.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Got all their names, names of them, their mothers, you know.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And it would all have been Cardiff families.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So when a ship went down that went off at Cardiff, and I mean, as you say, with the torpedoes, a load of ships was sunk near the Bristol Channel. They didn't even go in there.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Oh yeah, yeah. I think they were heading. I'm not sure if it was New Zealand or somewhere like that.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
But I got all the details here, you know, from the journey they were taking.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:53.000
But they sailed, well, I'd say they'd been out to Cardiff for two weeks or whatever when they were atop the coast. Yeah, so that was my brother I lost.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So what was the surname then? What was your brother's surname?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
My brother's surname was Frederick William Johnson.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Johnson. So because that was that a family name or that was his first dad's name?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
That was his. My mum was married to his father. Yeah.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I think his father's name was William Johnson. Right.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I got birthed into the kids, you know, my mother's marriage lines and that.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
So what was your first, what was your original name then Laura?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I was always known as Laura Savage. Right. My mother married my father.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
You know, when a divorce came through, she married my father.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So I've always been known as Laura Savage. But at one time when I went to get a birth certificate,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and my mother wasn't married to my father at the time she had me.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Originally, I should have been known as Laura Johnson. Yeah.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Because I remember I went to when I was working and we used to have not an original birth certificate.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
You could always get a birth certificate if you were working in a factory or something like that.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And the factory I was working in, I went to the registry office for a birth certificate and gave them my name.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And they searched and searched for this birth certificate for Savage, my name, Laura Savage.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I was named after my mother. And I remember the lady came down.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
She said, you know, she couldn't find my name, my name. What was my mother's maiden name?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And that's when they found out. And I always remember I tell a few of my friends now.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000
She came back and she said, you know what? She said, your name is Laura Johnson.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000
She said, because when my mother had me and registered me, I had to be registered in my mother's name, you see,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
because she wasn't married to my father at the time. Yeah.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I remember, I remember the day my mother got married in Loughnose Square Methodist Church.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And I had come from, I was going to some early school then in the primaries.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And I can remember coming home from school and where is my mother and my father and the lady,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
because it was always you had two rooms, you know, one room down then two rooms up and whatever.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And wherever you lived in Canal Peray, the lady of the house, I think someone was left there,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
because they were having a bit of a reception. I didn't know at the time.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And when I came home, you know, looking for my mum and dad, the lady said to me, your mum got married this morning.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And I can see it now. I tell all my friends. And I thought, so I left the house because I know my mother

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
was a very good-natured and very nice and very nice member of the West Alley,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000
of the Square, the Sisterhood and everything. And I went now looking and here was my mum and my father

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
coming from the church, almost reaching the house where we lived. And they were coming back, I mean,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.000
after being married, I think I was six years old then. But I can remember that day like it was yesterday.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So then I was going to Samaritan School then, a primary. Well then a few years after that,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000
my mum, what we would call today a nervous breakdown, because my nan always told us a story.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
When my mother was young, it was a fairground they had in Wood Street when my mother was like a teenager.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And she had a fall out of a swinging boat. And it must have fallen. She was injured.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And my nan always said, they told her the size, that my mother, something would happen with her.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:22.000
But if she was all right, she'd be saved at 21. See if she was okay by then.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
But it must have came on her, you know, a few years later. And today it would be called a nervous breakdown.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And get some treatment for it. But my mother at that time, you know, you went to hospital stay.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.000
My mother used to come out occasionally, but then go back. But my dad took a good rough name of bringing us up.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Until we went to my aunt and uncle to live. And then my father was taken to his reward.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Was it, when you went to live with your aunt and uncle, was that far or was it local or?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Oh no, it was just, at the time that I was living, when my father left me and my brother, where we were,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
because my father was the tenant of the house, and when he left to go to sea,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.000
he signed it over to this family that we knew that had taken rooms in the house with us.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So my father signed over the tenancy to the lady, Mrs. Jason, you see.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So then when I went down to live with my aunt and uncle, I was just going out for 12.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And my brother was 15 then. He was working, my brother. He had a job working in, he'd also, before that, he had joined the Air Force cadets.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I've got a picture of him in his Air Force uniform, cadet uniform.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And of course, back in the third, civil to three, he packed everything up.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:08.000
The cadet, on his job, he was working in a place in here in Canal Parade.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It was a ladder firm called Farnall. And my cousin, the two of them, of course we were in the house together,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
my aunt and uncle's son, and that was my cousin, Joey.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Joey and Freddie, they both were from Farnall. Another place.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:38.000
He had a job, so of course, getting the urge to go to this, let's see, and went and never returned.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So my father was taken. In the meantime, that's why we had to go down with my aunt and uncle to live,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:54.000
because no money was coming in. Like the allotment my father had left to the lady for me at Seast.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Of course, he was taken prisoner of war, so there was no money coming for me.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:07.000
After my aunt and uncle said, you know, that lady can't be taken care of, one of them, you know, Freddie was working,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000
because she had children of her own. So my aunt and uncle, who we were very close to, you know, because my mother's sister,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and he said, you know, then children got to come down with us.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So where did your aunt and uncle live?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Down in Stewart Street.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Ah, right, so still in the bay.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Oh yeah, only ten minutes away from where we were, yeah.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Because it would have been so much worse if you had to move completely.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Oh yes, and plus I had aunts all around, you know, because my mother was in Grains Town, and my nana's house was in Grains Town.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000
My nana had passed away then, but of course that is a family house. My aunt lived there until she died.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And I had a few aunts, you know, scattered around.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Big family then?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:13.000
No, my mother had four sisters, and before Donald, you know, my mother had three sisters and two brothers.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Right, so how was school then? How was school?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Oh school, I was in St Mary's in the primary.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Yeah.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And I think I left St Mary's when I was about seven, something like that.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And then we did have a time, at that time you moved from one house to another, me and my father and my brother.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And at one time we did move, my aunt and uncle, this was before they moved to Stewart Street, they lived in Homesdale Street.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I can remember we went down there to live, me and my brother and my father, we went to the same house, my aunt and uncle.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And then eventually we came back up and we were living in Albert Square.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Right.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So, you know, most of my life was spent in that period when I went down to Grange Town, because I was in Grange Council.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I think it must have only been for about a year or something like that.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And then, like when I came back, I went to South Jersey School.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I went to South Jersey School from the time I was, oh, I think it was about, I think it was about ten when I started in South Jersey School.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
You know, like the children change now, at age 11 they go to another school.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I think I was about, it comes from Grange Town then, I went to South Jersey School.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
From the time I was about 10 or 11 until I left at the age of 14.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Right.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I still got my leaving school card, I found here a few years ago.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:19.000
I should ask you, when your dad was a prisoner of war, what was it like when he came back?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Now, my dad wasn't a prisoner of war in Germany.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.000
The only proof I've got is, of course, my father was West African, you see.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And when he was a prisoner of war, the only proof I've got is prisoner of war in French New Guinea.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Right.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
See, he wasn't a prisoner of war in Germany, French New Guinea.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I've got a letter here, the only proof I have got, and of course, me being young at the time,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I don't know, I've still got these letters, still, you know, I've kept them, you know, whatever.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
The only proof I've got is a letter that my father had sent, addressed to me,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
must have gone to the house when I was living with my aunt, that's when my father was imprisoned.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
That somebody had wrote for, because, you know, my father used to sign the cross, you know.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And this was a letter someone had written, and it was to me, you know, it was my father's statement.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
This person had written the letter for my father, and asking that, I think,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
it was like my brother to take care of me, something to that effect.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And I got the address, you know, the top of the letter.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Right.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
The person had written, and my father had got his cross at the bottom.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Right.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And that's the only proof I've got that my father was in this prison of war camp, you know.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Yeah.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
That's better, that's better.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Oh, I don't.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And I would tell him to write down.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
You're okay now, I can hear you again.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Okay.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
You were saying about your father, the guy wrote the letter for him.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Yeah, this is like my dad's words to him, you know, he must have been saying, you know,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
he must have asked the chap, you know, send this to my daughter, you know.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Right.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
To tell me we're all right and whatever.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
And if we could, to send something out of that, I don't know if it was, you know,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
like clothes or food stuff, anything like that.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
I could show anyone what I've got here.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Did your father come home?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Oh, yes, he came home.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Yeah.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And it was a funny thing because he was a sick man before he left.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
But of course they were taking anyone, you know.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
He'd been home from sea for years, you know, looking after us children.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000
But yes, he came home and he was home for about, he came home,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I think he was home for about two years when he died.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:16.000
He did do, when he came home, he went back to sea because he died at sea, my father.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Right.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:25.000
On I think about the second trip on a ship he was on and he died at sea.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
You know, I've got my father's certificates, you know, from when,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
because he left me a little bit of money.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Yeah.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Because before he joined the ship that he died on, I was 15 at the time, a teenager.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
But we used to, we had a club in Glutony there where we used to go dancing, you know,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
as a teenager.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Yeah.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
And he knew you always find me there, you know, after like the evening time.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And before he joined the ship the day before, he came to find me because I was still living down with my aunt and uncle.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:10.000
And he came to see me before he went because his last words was, he told me, he said,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
if he didn't come back, I can remember saying to him, oh, don't say that, Dad.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
He said, if I don't come back, he told me what to do.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
He left a message.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I have to go to these solicitors.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Right.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
And after that, he didn't come back.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And then after getting in touch with the solicitor, who was my co-in-law at the time in Working Street,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
and my dad had left me some money.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Right.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
And of course I had some assets.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
As a matter of fact, my mother had passed away at the time.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And it was from this money that my father left me that I paid for my mother's funeral.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Yeah.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Yeah.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
So, is that all?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Not an easy upbringing at all, was it?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Let's be fair, Laura.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
I'm not saying, I mean, it wasn't easy, but...

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Oh, no.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
It was hard for everybody, wasn't it?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
It was hard for everybody.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Yeah.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I've caught up with the mum and dad.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Yeah.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
I can remember all the times with my mother.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Oh, she was great, my mother.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
There's not many who remember my mother, but there was one person, she always just said to me,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
I remember your mother, Laura, she was such a docile woman.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
You know, your mother is a quiet woman.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Yeah, I can remember.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Yeah, my mum used to take us to the house.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
I always went to Sunday school.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:44.000
And on a Sunday evening, I'd be in the Square Methodist for them, the evening service, every Sunday with my mum.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Yeah.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
So, let's jump a bit.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Did you go on the school trips?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Not on school trips, no, but on the Woodson Street.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Yeah, the Woodson Street. Yeah, the church trips, yeah.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
The Woodson Street from Lowes Square.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
I got a picture here of the lorries taking them.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:15.000
My brother is on it, and one or two boys from school.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000
You know, this was more or less like most of the boys that went to South Jersey school.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And from Lowes Square Methodist, most of us in the Gales and Boys Life Brigade.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000
But I've got a picture of them on the truck, you know, just outside leaving to go on the Woodson Street.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And we used to think it was so nice.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
We'd be stuck in a field maybe, I think at other times, I think there was landlion or something like that.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Oh, we thought it was such a posh place, you know.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
And we'd be stuck in a field with all cows in the next field, and whatever.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.000
And oh yeah, every year we'd have the Woodson Street and have our races and everything.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
That was from Lowes Square. Of course, a lot of the kids went to the mission in Angelina Street, you know.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
That was their Sunday school.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:23.000
And then you had Samaritan's Church, you know, that was all three churches at the time, the Bay Area.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Of course, Samaritan's is still going strong.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Lowes Square was knocked down, and now it's just a small place, St Paul's Church.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000
People say about how actually elegant the houses were in Lowes Square.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Well, Lowes Square Church, I don't think I've got any pictures of it.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
There were no pictures around. Oh, that was a big church, yes.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:59.000
I can remember going there when we'd put the Magic Lansons, but we used to pay a penny to go to.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
That was the first time we ever seen, honestly, Magic Lansons.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Those houses were big old houses as well, weren't they?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Oh yeah, them houses they reckon, you know, were owned by doctors and people at those ship-holding.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Oh yeah, they were elegant houses.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
There were two sides there, they had basements, you know.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Well, there were three sides that had basements, because we had our park.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
We had our park right in the middle of Lowes Square.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
That park that we had, it had a fountain in the middle, and that fountain was very deep.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.000
You know, it was it rained all around, but it was very deep that fountain.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
You saw to it went up a bit of a hill, and you climbed, so you got to the railing.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
And then, you know, there's no way you could get there unless you wanted to jump in and drown yourself.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
That was a beautiful park.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
And then later on in the years, they put some, we did have a stream,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
and then later on they put more rides for us there, you know.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:24.000
I can remember when we used to come from school, and about, say, about five o'clock, or about five,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
the boys, now and again, they'd have a boxing match, and a ring would be put up.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.000
I can remember a few of the boys, and they'd have a boxing match, you know, with two of the boys,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
or, you know, a few volunteering to fight each other.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Oh, we had some lovely school days there, mind, told in the day.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:56.000
I mean, so many people were related, and families going back as friends for years.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Oh, but regardless whether you was related or not, I mean, everyone's door was open,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
and everyone was auntie, your aunt, your uncle.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
As soon as next door to someone, they were always auntie, and as they sent you to the shop,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
you didn't want to go, you would have to go, you know.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
There's no way you could say no, you're not going, or whatever like that.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
And then people were so generous, you know, we'd have a butter,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
they'd hate me to go into the shop, or whatever.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
But, oh yeah, it was a community, it was fantastic.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:45.000
I mean, someone described it to me as the village in Cardiff, you know, and it was more like a village than...

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Oh yeah, it was cosmopolitan, I'd say, you know, all nationalities.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
So we had all nationalities there.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000
We had, well, from what you call almost fellies down to a pierhead,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:08.000
but they reckon that's all, from Customs Street is a mile, I think they call that, the Rock One Mile.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:15.000
And from that one mile, my good with me, down the bottom of George Street,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:24.000
you had the Spanish, you had the Maltese, more or less inside the bay,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
you had the Africans and the Similes, it was mostly there.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000
But we had Maltese, and then we also had a Norwegian...

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
what's the name on each street there?

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Norwegian Church, you know, and then that moved.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
No, not Church, that was a Norwegian home.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
That was bombed.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
I was stood outside at the night, because during the war, time didn't mean anything.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
It must have been like two or three in the morning, after the rage,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
we'd all be out looking and finding out what was bombed.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
I can remember the night that was bombed, the Norwegian home.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000
I can remember looking at it, seeing the bomb had long fallen and killed people there.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
And I can remember being outside, just looking at that crate that's moving,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000
where the bomber dropped and killed the people, a lot of Arabs, the Norwegian club,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
and an Arab boarding house and cats, where people, even a little girl,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
knew the bloke in Sapphire Street here.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:47.000
She was at one of the houses when the asylum went, and couldn't get back home to her old house.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
And as a matter of fact, she was killed that night, I can picture her now, little William.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000
She was just one child that was killed, whether trying to make her way home,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
for some reason, I don't know if it was because that house just missed the bomb.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Yeah, she was killed that night, little William.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
And we had air raid shelters all along huge street.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:24.000
You could still see the marks in the wall, that wall on the left side of huge street,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
where the shelters were.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:35.000
We had shelters, we had all numbers drawn, shelter number 8, number 9, number 7.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Well, there were times when we got to more or less sleep all night in the shelters.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
When I went down the docks to live in my aunt's house, we had an Anderson shelter up at the back,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
one of the corrugated ones.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And that's where we tried to go there, went there.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:05.000
It's either under the table or in the cupboard under the stairs, when the sirens went.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:14.000
But well, I was a teenager then, and we used to go to an instant even, school there, on a Friday.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
They'd have a dance and a speedy.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And I can remember when we were caught one night when a siren went to me and my cousin.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
My cousin was Joey, I had another cousin, like my mother.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
My aunt had a boy, Joey and Iris.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
And my cousin Iris was about maybe 18 months older than me.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
And of course we used to knock it out together.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
And coming home one night when the siren had gone, the Germans were bombing us.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
And we had to make our way back down to Stewart Street, not a hand in front of you, you know, on the black house.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Not a light could be shone.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:00.000
And we had to make our way back down because we were going from shelter to shelter, trying to get our way home.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:11.000
And I said, for all that, it was when you think about it, it wasn't thrilling because the army was stationed at the city hall.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
And of course we used a drone of the German bombers.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
And it was a bit exciting because you've got the searchlights searching in the sky, you know, to get the planes.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
And then you hear the attack guns going.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Oh yeah. It was dangerous. It was rough.
