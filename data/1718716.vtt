00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920
cottage which has variously been the school. That was the school when the village was first built.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.960
It was said that the lady of the house, Anna Theopho Phillips, daughter of the Lekker Stoke

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.240
fort, found it a little too noisy. So since they owned it they built another one up here, which

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:32.480
was 10 years later, and then turned the old school into a laundry. It's always known as laundry.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.120
There's an interesting thing around the village. There are certain places that have names that have

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.360
absolutely no relationship to what it is. It's still very much known as the laundry around the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:55.040
village. It hasn't been a laundry for decades, half a century or more. The corner at the top

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.120
is where you go around towards the hall. It's known as the Green Door Bend. There's no green

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:12.080
doors there anymore. We talk rather bluntly about the lime heap. There's a certain thing

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:20.080
that wasn't the lime heap. It's a good story because if you don't know, it's the sharp bend

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:29.840
at the very top of the Red Hill. Many, many years ago, one of the farmers up there wanted a load of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:40.400
lime. So the cart had brought the lime up and dumped it out in the field on that bend.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.520
Unfortunately, it was the wrong farm or the wrong field.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.600
Then arose the problem of what happened to the lime. The cart insisted that he had delivered it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.680
to where he was told to. The owner of the ground said it was absolutely nothing to do with him.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.720
The real owner of the ground also said it was in the wrong place, so it was nothing to do with him.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.600
So it stayed there. It became known as the lime heap bend, the corner. That's the high point of

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.880
the hill there. If you go through the gate and kick around in the ground, you can still find

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.080
evidence of the lime being there. There's all sorts of local names that mean something to do with it.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:39.440
So, well, initiated with them, but the newcomers completely muttered back at us.
