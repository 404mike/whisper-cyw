I think a slightly older property is potentially the bulk.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.640
So you've got Brondervour which is old and that's where Fowl is where which is over up

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:18.320
on Laith D up over there and then the bulk if you go out towards on the back road by us and then out

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.400
towards Lambista there's a property on the the top of the hill you wouldn't actually see it unless

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:32.640
you turn back up there along Lindor's Way that's got a lintel above the the fireplace with a carving

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:43.280
of the sun in it and I think it says in there 1643 or something like that carved into it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.560
and I've only been there once Diane and I spent our honeymoon the first night of our

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.840
our wedding there that was our a little escape from the party.
