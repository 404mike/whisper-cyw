00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
So when you went to reform the mori teres, did that feel very different being now?

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.640
Oh it was horrible.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.280
Right, okay.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.720
It was, first of all, it was quite strange men and women sat together.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.800
And having always up until then been separated, that was strange.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.960
I didn't like the organ either.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:29.280
The Hebrew was pronounced in a different way, which as a child or a girl growing up, I acclimatised to

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.360
I did have cheda there for a year or so.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.520
I think they wanted me to be bat mitzvah and I more or less, not bat mitzvah but

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.600
they didn't have anything for females in the orthodox.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.320
But the reform did a little bit more.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.720
We had a regular rabbi, Rabbi Graf, who was also German or from Germany.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.920
I don't know whether I flunked out of it or what but by then I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.960
I wasn't all that demure.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.160
I'd had coaching in order to get part, to get, I was given coaching in order to get through the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.440
11 plus and I'd had enough of, I suppose, Hebrew extra lessons.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.720
I didn't want any more extra lessons for the rest of my life.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.120
And I think the two other girls, Aunt Joseph was one, I can't remember who the other one was.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.760
Oh, Barbara Graf.
