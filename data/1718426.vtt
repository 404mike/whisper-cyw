00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Can you tell me how long you've lived in Abicum here?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:16.000
Yes, I moved to Abicum here in about, I can't ever remember whether it's June or July, in 1991.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.400
It was a Friday and I remember that because I'd bribed a lot of people from work,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.000
which was at Radnor district in town where I'd been since January 1st 1990 to come and help me move in.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.400
And Mrs Jones, that's the old Mrs Jones, so John Jones' mother from the happy union,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.000
she cooked fish and chips and peas for everybody.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.400
So my criteria for looking for a house was that it had to be somewhere easy to commute into, Llandrindut,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.800
but a village with a pub so I could walk home from the pub after an evening's entertainment.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.600
And of course I chose Cross Cottage, which as you know is between the church and the pub.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.160
So yes, I moved there after this long selection process and the place just spoke to me.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.160
And again, here's the infamous Mrs Jones for you.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:24.920
So I went to several pubs and I remember Mrs Jones was the owner of the pub in Aberedu

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.000
and she used to serve beer in a jug.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.360
I think there was a Jones at the Red Lion in Llanavn Vau and I went to look at that.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.640
And I came here on an evening and it was about, I came on my own actually,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.480
and it was about 7.30 at night and the pub had just opened because it used to open then,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.760
even when no one was in it.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.120
And I sat there and I chatted to Mrs Jones until about nine o'clock when the first customer came in.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.280
But I, and she sat at the bar and she chatted to me and I thought, this is great,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.040
so fantastic, you know, just being such a welcoming, open place and it was sold to me.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.320
That and then Cross Cottage just spoke to me.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.200
Being the former school, it was such a wonderful,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.360
characterful building, now a listed building of course, it wasn't at the time.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.840
A gothic school, the architecture really spoke to me.
