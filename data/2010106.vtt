00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Please introduce yourself.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
My name is Ashmit Kumar Sahha. I am eight years old. I live in Cardiff and my mother tongue is Bengali.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Excellent. So Ashmit, what do you know about the story of Madhurga?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Once upon a time there was a wicked demon called Mohit Shashod.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
He wanted to be immortal and very powerful.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So he did penance to please Lord Tromba, who is the creator of the universe.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Lord Tromba appeared in front of Mohit Shashod and offered him a boon.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Mohit Shashod asked if he could be immortal and very powerful.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Lord Tromba disagreed to this and said that he could not make anybody immortal.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Then Mohit Shashod asked if it would be possible if only a woman would be able to kill him and not any male person.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Lord Tromba agreed to this and gave him the boon.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:34.000
After this Mohit Shashod got really happy and thought that he would be invincible now and started destroying everything and being very cruel.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
He started chasing all the gods away and challenging all bad things.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The gods escaped to Lord Shiv in the mountains of the Himalayas.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Lord Shiv heard about all this and got very angry at Mohit Shashod.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So Lord Shiv made a woman figure with his powers.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
All the gods gave her all their powers and lots of weapons.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This woman was named Durga.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
After this Durga went into a battle with Mohit Shashod.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
During the battle Mohit Shashod changed his form into lots of other animals.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
First he changed his form into an elephant.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
After this Durga changed his form into an elephant.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:56.000
At the last of all he turned himself into a buffalo and Madhurga stabbed a trident into the buffalo's chest and killed him.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
After this it was a very happy place to live on.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
That is a fascinating story. Thank you for telling us that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
What do you think we celebrate during Durga Puja?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We celebrate the victory of good over evil.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
During Durga Puja?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
During Durga Puja.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000
In terms of how we celebrate Durga Puja in Wales, how long have you been going to the Durga Puja in Wales?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
As I said earlier I am eight years old.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000
When I was one or two years old for the first Durga Puja I went to, I went to the Kolkata Durga Puja.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The other seven years I have seen Durga Puja in the Wales Puja Committee.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Very nice. So I imagine you enjoy the Durga Puja here very much?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Oh yes, I love it.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So what things do you like or enjoy most during the Durga Puja?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I love meeting everyone. I like playing with my friends. I love the food.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I think Durga Puja is a very happy time to meet everyone and celebrate together because it is a very happy festival for us.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Do you do any performances on stage during Durga Puja?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Yes, we do singing, dancing and sometimes grown-ups do funny plays in Hindi or Bengali.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Very nice. And do you enjoy performing on stage with your friends?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Yes.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Do you love it?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Yes.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Very nice. What about clothes? Do you wear new clothes during Durga Puja?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Yes, almost every day.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Every day. What type of new clothes do you wear most of the day?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
We wear our Indian traditional clothes which is called a bhajama and bhajabi.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And we have traditional shoes called nagra which normally kings and princes wear.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Very nice. So you wear nagras as well? Sometimes.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I used to wear when I was small but now they have become quite small so I need to buy a few new ones.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
You need to get a few new pairs. Excellent.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So, you know the images of Goddess Durga and her children, are they beautiful?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Yes, they are very beautiful.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Do you know how they are made at all?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Yes, first they are sculpted with clay and then they are decorated and painted with lots of different colours and nice patterns.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And sometimes even jewellery is put on them.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Excellent. Would you like to see some images being made in Cardiff by the special artists who make them in Kolkata in India?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Yes, I would really love to.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Do you like art? Yes.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So would you like to be able to learn how to make images out of clay?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Yes.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So if you see the artists who come to Cardiff, you can learn that, won't you?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Yes.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Would you spend a lot of time looking at how they make things?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Yes.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Very nice. Very nice.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Okay, that's a brilliant interview. Thank you very much for your time. We very much appreciate it.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
No problem.
