This is Emily in Llamberes Community Orchard.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:17.260
The flow is always the same meandering across the space, but somehow new life appears, meandering

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.760
with rhythms within rhythms and the beauty of becoming and becoming, always meandering

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.400
and flowing, sunlight stretching to the sky, all directions spreading out, a network of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.800
lines, the echo of footsteps on the earth, rhythms of the floating world within tiny

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.520
universes of love and fun, flows from flowers into people, all directions spreading out,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.120
grasses growing and bending, undulating, always meandering of life.
