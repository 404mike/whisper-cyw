Do you have any memories as a child about a particular festival or high holy days?

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.680
I remember the Seder night distinctly. We always used to go to Dinness Powers for Seder.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:21.200
Different to today because even today I take services now and I conduct a Seder night service

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.680
so the people who are in the service can understand what's going on. In those days we didn't understand

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.760
what was going on. It was just all read in Hebrew. Nobody understood anything and we did what we did.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.720
That was the way that it was done. There was more time spent asking people to be quiet and stop talking

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.120
than actually doing the service. As youngsters and I was the youngest of three we always used to have

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.960
to ask the four questions and that was a daunting task for anybody growing up especially in front

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.640
of all your aunts and uncles and cousins and I wouldn't have not done it for the world. You know

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.800
I can think of the bad points but I can think of the great points as well and probably the great

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.160
points are it brought the family together and we were together as a family and that was probably

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.040
the most important which gives me my feeling for family and community worth as it is today

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.600
and I think that is really really really important for the family to get together and stay together

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.440
and my father was exactly the same probably even more than me because if anybody said something

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.960
wrong it's okay because they're part of the family and he wouldn't have anything bad said about

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.240
any member of the family whoever they were whatever they had said whatever they had done

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.560
he wouldn't have had it done and if any member of the family got into problems

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.040
the rest of the family got together and helped them and it happened. So you would often meet you

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.160
said at Dinus Powis? Dinus Powis was where like the Kratowski family came together and

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.200
228 Kinkoid Road was where the Rapport family got together.
