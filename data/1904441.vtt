00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm Stephanie Cruz, ymhlithwyr ymgyrchol ym Mlyncs. Mae'n 14 August 2019.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Ac rwy'n ymwneud ym Mhob ym Mhob, yn Rhaedder, yn ymwneud Ã¢ Paul Carter.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Paul, mae'n bwysig iawn, gyda'r hyn yn ddaeth amser.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Can you give me a brief outline of the different stages it's been through?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, I can. It's not really brief, though, because it's been such a chequered history and it's changed its use so often.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Even the history that we have, it's a little bit blurry right back at the start, but we're now convinced that it dates back to 1803

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and is a sister building to the mill over the stream from us, the Derelict Mill.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The building as it was built had a culvert of water which was taken out of the Y.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It ran round the back of the building, through the middle of the building, and drove a water wheel right in the centre of the building.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This one here. Right in this building.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So that was what was happening and we think it was driving machinery from one end of the building to the other, which is quite something.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's a long building, about 30 metres long.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And the machinery was used for? Do we know that?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm not entirely sure. It's all got lost in the history because after about 35 years in use, we believe, as Woollen Mill, that's where it's a bit blurred.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
One history document says Woollen Mill, the other one doesn't have any documentation until 1837,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but it definitely was the Castle Leatherworks in 1837.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And what sort of work would they be doing here? Would they be doing something like scraping the hides?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
They were taking the leather from the three tanneries in town and converting it, as you say, scraping the hides.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There's a lot of aprons being made, a lot of shammy leathers.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I have seen some documentation and it might be from the one that's been redone in Raglan,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
where there were shoes and things being made in Raerdydd and I suspect they were being made here as well.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So it was a big building, three storeys high, again going 30 metres down the length of the building.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And what had happened was, from what we can gather, the woollen industry moved out of Raerdydd,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
went across to Newtown around 1837, which ties in with it becoming a leatherworks.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And then it stayed as a leatherworks until the leather industry started to have a few hiccups, which was around 1900.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Do we know who owned the building in 1837?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
No, no. It might be on record, but I'm not sure who owned it.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But around that 1900 time, I think it's 1905, that was when the Edward Price Morgan comes in.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And he bought the building as a three storey building. He had military links.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And I think I'm right in saying he was using it as a military base already, the ground floor.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And then there was a massive fire which took out the far end of the building.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I suspect the building was falling down at that time anyway.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It was right down in the floodplain, half a storey below where we're sitting now, which is a long way down,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
about eight foot down, right down with the flood levels of the water.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
It was three storeys high, so it was twice the height of what we have today.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And knowing the state of the building when we took it on, I think it was probably falling down and they didn't know what to do with it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So I think the fire, at least it focused their opinion on what to do next.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It took out everything at the end, which is now a hall.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
There was nothing left. You could see straight out the far side of the building from one side to the other.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The walls on the one side were pretty much gone already as well.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And it was rebuilt then as a drill hall.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Right.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And that's 1911. It was already being used as a drill hall and the fire was around that time as well.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So it was a very quick conversion they did.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
They took the whole of the top floor off.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And I know for a fact that most of it went down underneath our building because I've dug up quite a bit of it.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
The stones were original stones, as in the rest of the stone building.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And within two years of being opened as a drill hall, they opened it as a cinema.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And there's remnants of the screen still here and visible.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And they started showing films and very quickly after that, I've just shown Stephanie a photograph of a hung cinema screen.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
They cut down the screen they put up and hung a screen and started putting on music events.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So there were three names at exactly the same time then.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
There was the drill hall, the castle cinema and the castle ballroom.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So they had dances as well?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
There were dances and through both world wars they were used for dances.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
That's wonderful. And then what?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Well, as I say, there's lots of stories attached to the wartime dances.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Apparently the Rehada folk used to love coming to some of the American nights.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And unbelievably, it sounds so crazy in these days, there were black nights and white nights in the hall.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And the Rehada people loved the black nights because the music was apparently amazing.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And a white general decided he was going to put an end to these nights and came in stamped his foot on the stage.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
The band heard the beat, started playing with the beat of his feet and the whole place went into complete uproar.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Everybody dancing, leaping around and the general had to leave.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
You can imagine it, can't you?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Yeah, just the whole building does seem to love music.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000
As soon as you start playing music in there, you can feel it sort of beating along with it.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I have got a recording which was an EP made by one of the local bands.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
They recorded some music. They called themselves the Dam Busters.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Referring back to the fact that the film was filmed up here and that was where the actual Dam Buster thing was originally practiced.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
They practiced the Barnes Walliser. So it was a great name for them to have.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And they released an EP, which there are still a few copies rattling around and we have a copy of a copy.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
A recording there?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Yeah, I hope so. I have warned Stephanie that playing isn't the easiest.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Brilliant, that's really good. And there are three tracks on that.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
There are six tracks on that EP. Plenty of selection.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Three of that band are still alive, still living in Rhaedau.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
We lost Little Don unfortunately a couple of years back.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
He played the harmonica.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Piano accordion.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Piano accordion. You can tell I'm a musician as well. I'm glad you're listening.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Piano accordion that was almost as big as he was.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And there's Glenda joining in with the conversation.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And he played the left hand.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Right.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But we tried to get him to play in his last year of his life and he would have loved to.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
But he said he just could not handle the piano accordion. It was too big.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
He just couldn't handle it anymore.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And the other three band members?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
There's John Humphreys. He was the drummer.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
David Evans was the double bass.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And I always forget Mike's second name. What's Mike's second name, Glen?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Bennett.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Mike Bennett who used to work at the water treatment plant.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Yes, correct. He was vocals and guitar.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And there were two others who I never got to meet at all.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Say Little Don, I can't remember his second name either.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
There was plenty of people in Rhaedau who will know them all.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Yes, brilliant.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And so after, I guess it's almost heyday during the wars, what happened?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It carried on as a music venue.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Obviously they're slightly different because there were so many people lost during the war, particularly the men folk.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And it stayed with us until television started to kick in and people started to stay in their homes and not go out.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And there was a brief period when it became an engineering works.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Orbital Gears, who are still in town, started to work here.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And unfortunately for them, the culvert was still under the building and it flooded.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And their machinery was all at ground floor level and they had to lift the machinery out to get it away.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And they moved up to the other end of town away from the floodplain.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And at that point it became a supermarket.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And J&B supermarket, I think, was the first.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It looks like the Morgan family were involved in running the supermarket because there's lots of pieces of paper attached to, I think it's JP Morgan.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But it's most commonly known as the Old Mace supermarket because that was what the supermarket was prior to us taking it on.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
But I did warn you that it's not a short history unless it's had lots of use.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And the number of people who have memories of either working in here or coming to events is quite incredible.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
They keep on coming down to see us at the hall and talking to us.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
We've obviously stirred a lot of memories.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Yes, it's lovely. And a little bit about yourself. Why did you take it on? Why were you brought in? What do you want to do with it?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Because I'm a bit silly really.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
My mother-in-law still lives in Raerdyd. She's aged 97 now.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And we were visiting Raerdyd every year, every school holiday.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000
We knew how nice a time we had holidaying here. And that was 30 years with our children growing up.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
The building was getting into a terrible state. It had lain empty for eight years.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And there wasn't a window left intact on the building. It was quite clear that the roof had gone from one end to the other.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And sadly the stonework was starting to crack on the bottom end of the hall, so the riverside end.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And it's a building I've always been quite fond of, quite liked. It was an interesting building from the outside.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:59.000
So I wondered what was going on. Why was it lying empty? It went to auction and didn't sell.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And I came up with a crazy plan for a music venue and cafe.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Which eventually I talked my family into looking at.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Right. And when was this?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000
That's going back to 2012 was when we first started looking at it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000
We put together what can only be described as a crazy business plan.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And started negotiating with a view to buying.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And at one point it looked like it was sold, but it came back to us.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And it seems like the hall wanted to be saved and wanted to be saved as a music venue.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000
That's how it's felt ever since. Every time we've wondered what on earth are we going to do next, something's happened.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And it's carried on. And we're very proud to say we're now an award-winning cafe.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And a music venue which bands just love. It's as simple as that.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We're getting some of the best bands in Britain playing here.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
It certainly has a lovely atmosphere when you come in.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And very welcoming with the outdoor space that you've got there.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
One of my colleagues at Ellen Lynx has actually played here as well. She says it's a lovely venue.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
So yeah, it is a real asset to me.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
The bands are coming in, we're getting top musicians coming in and they're obviously talking to one another.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And the first thing they're doing is clapping their hands, clicking their fingers and just going, wow.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
So there is something a bit special and we're not quite sure what it is.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
We're terrified of doing too much work in there because we know how easy it is to spoil an acoustic.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So we're treading caegely on the inside of the hall.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000
We're trying to get away with it as it is for as long as possible and get on with the rest of the building work.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So you've still got plenty to do then?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Yes, we're in the process of doing the changing rooms and the backstage areas now.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000
So for the bands it's going to be a much nicer area for them to prepare, get ready to go so they can get straight on stage.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
They'll have a toilet backstage so if anybody gets desperate to go to the loo,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
they can just go and come back without interfering too much with performance.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And what we have done is reversed the direction from when Mike Bennett and Don and all the team

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
were singing in here. We actually have our stage at what I call the top end of the hall

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and our bar is where the stage was when they were playing in it.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
So we've turned it around, but it seems like the atmosphere is exactly the same.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
It's still...

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Brilliant.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And yeah, we're hoping to show films. So at one time maybe we'll become the Castle Cinema, the Castle Ballroom.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I don't see us becoming a drill hall again, but that's possible as well.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
But where did you get the name from, The Lost Ark? What's the story behind that?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000
We have lots of lost arks, but we'd come up with the name Lost Ark before any of those arks actually got uncovered.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Again, it seems like serendipity that we actually found arks.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
But we've called it Art Roots Cafe.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And the very sad thing is two people suggested The Lost Ark in the same week.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:42.000
A very bright student who my wife and I used to teach and my son's mother-in-law both suggested it within two days of one another.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Because everybody's heard of Raiders of the Lost Ark and we're the Lost Ark of Raider.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And it was a simple, very unfunny little thing, but it amused us all.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And to be quite fair, we'd still be discussing the name of the building if we hadn't decided let's go for it.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
It makes people smile, it's memorable and it's stuck.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And now people just say they're going down to the Ark. So that's great.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
It's become a Raider name.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
That's right, already.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Well done to you and to the family and good luck with the future.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Thank you very much, Stephanie. Thank you.
