00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.840
internationale

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I do not know.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.500
Come with the glider,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.500
really over the fire.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
Come on, my little wind,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.500
glue thy glider again,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.500
all the bones in the steel of fire.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.500
And I want a kid

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.500
who will not let in a wind

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.500
the wind that soars and the glider in line.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.000
Run closer and scream,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
tell if those are a thing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'll find the glider,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
really, really high.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Tell me, can I,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.500
find a piece of the glider, please,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.500
out of bones in the steel of fire?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Out of bones in the steel of fire?
