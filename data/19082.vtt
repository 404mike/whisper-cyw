Well they were coming to Orono from all over, weren't they? From Bristol and Somerset and the work in the mines.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.160
It was the local Klondike sort of thing, wasn't it? You know, not much of a Klondike about it now.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.920
Oh this locality here was, well you know that Cambrian up here, there was about 3,000 men working there,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.520
and there's none there now. The Flannabier Cartier which we called it, which is known as the Scotch

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.840
Cartier, about 3,000 working there, there's no, not shut. The Navelle Cartier in Penigraeg, about 2,000.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.040
That's shut. You know, only in this locality I've been talking, you're talking about 15 or 20,000 men,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.840
only in a small locality like this. And of course all the way up the valley, the same.
