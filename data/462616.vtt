The miners strike, what's your memories of watching that on television?

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:21.160
Both my grandads worked in the mines, so always I've been aware of miners and from my grandparents

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:33.680
obviously both my tides were miners. Jolly hard life, very unsociable hours, unsociable working

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:45.440
conditions, so I've always had a strong feeling for miners. I'm not a person that supports strikes

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.600
are such, but I do think that when the miners went on strike they had their valid reasons,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.640
whatever that might have been. It was a sad day for our country when it happened because I do

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:11.520
think that their striking caused great upset within the country. But we live in a democratic

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:21.440
country and everybody is entitled to have their say and their way of life and I suppose it was

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.560
inevitable that the miners would need better conditions and certainly would need better

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:37.120
money. So I did have sympathy with them. What was your opinion of how the miners were portrayed

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.040
on television? Well, I suppose like any other organisation when you get a group of people who

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:59.160
have got a problem and become incensed by it, sometimes their reactions can be perhaps not

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:07.600
exactly what you would admire and they were not always perhaps portrayed in the best light,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:20.000
but they had a grievance and they had to put it across one way or another and rightly or wrongly

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:31.960
How did you view the strike as a Welsh strike or a British strike? I didn't view it as a Welsh

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:40.040
strike, no. It was a strike of the country as a whole. I didn't feel it was appertaining to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.320
Wales alone, although we've lost all our mines virtually, haven't we? I mean we were renowned

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:55.520
for our coal mining going back way, way back when How Proud Was My Valley was an interesting film,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:06.360
Paul Robeson and How Green Was My Valley and Proud Valley. So it really wasn't just a Welsh

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.800
person's problem. So from my point of view, I think it affected the country as a whole,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:27.480
Did it have an effect on the community here, do you think? This was a steel village, Brumbo,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:38.720
big steel mining. Up to a point, yes, I would say so, because when the work people in Brumbo

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:48.480
had their problems, obviously, and it was after the miners' strike that the men in Brumbo went on

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.880
strike. I suppose they felt, well, other people are striking, if we have a problem, we will strike.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:03.560
And for the first time ever, there was a strike in Brumbo in the steelworks, which was practically

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.000
unheard of before. So yes, I would say that the miners' strike probably was in their mines,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.960
and they saw how that was dealt with, and they decided that they would strike. Though whether

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.200
it's good to strike, that's debatable, isn't it?
