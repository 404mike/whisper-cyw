00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.520
That's it. Interview number 5, Marie Fanariotti in the Greek Orthodox Church. Friday the 29th

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:30.320
of March 2019. And Katerina Lange.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:53.520
Yes.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.520
Yes.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.520
Yes. Yes.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.480
I remember well because I worked my first job after school. My first job when I left school,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:22.720
I worked for Bistis Shipchandler. He was Andriotis, the nabodinander. And I worked in the office with

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.760
lots of other people. The Pasco family. John Pasco was in charge of the office.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.920
That was just one of them, wasn't it? Bistis. Mr. Bistis himself was Bistis Shipstoss.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.920
Where was Bistis? Where was his writing?

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.920
Down the bay. Just past.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.920
On Bute Street?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.920
On Bute Street.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920
Just past where the bank is now.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.920
Oh no.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.920
I think they're renovating the bank. Opposite to Quantum.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920
Quantum.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.080
Next to the bank. Where the Portuguese coffee shop is now. That's where it was.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.560
That's where Bistis was. And that's where I worked as a young girl of 15, I think, when I left school.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.280
If I don't mind, when was that? 1960?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280
Well, I was only 47, so.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280
1962.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.280
1962.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.040
Father Spiro got me the job. The priest at the time here. He was from Kerkira.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.880
Anyway, that was one of them. Then Mr. Kallinikos had his.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.880
It was in James Street.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.520
James Street. That was the Greek Consulate.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:46.560
And also he had ship shantlers. A lot of young men and ladies worked in his offices too.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.120
One of them was Alego Dant. He was passed away recently.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.120
Do you remember when? Where on?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.120
In James Street.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.120
Approximately on James Street?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.120
Just off. Just behind.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.120
It's where the new houses are now, isn't it?

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.120
It's where that new estate is in James Street.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.120
What? Century Walk?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.120
The Louisa Estate. The one with the brick.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.120
Yes. The red brick.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.120
That's when it was. It was all knocked down.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.120
And the new housing estate.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.680
When did Kallinikos close?

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.680
The Consulate.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.680
When he actually closed his stores.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.680
The stores? No, he was working the stores as well as the Consulate.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.680
But when did he close? Because he was taking the ship from the ship shantlers.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680
The Consulate from his home address.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.680
The Consulate closed in 1984.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.240
I know this because Father Sanopatas remembered about this.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.240
He gave me a couple of portraits of Kallinikos.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.240
Any other old buildings?

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.240
Yes, we had Samonas.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.240
The ship shantlers as well.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.240
Samonas.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.240
First time I'm hearing about this.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.240
Were the Kolakidists down there or not?

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800
Samonas were pretty.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.800
I have no idea.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.800
Who was Samonas?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.800
Somebody was talking about Samonas.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.800
He was just like Serike Pola and Tasia.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.800
Tasia Bridge.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.800
She was here.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.800
She was there.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800
I'm trying to think.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.800
Metissera.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.800
That was Mandros.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.800
Yes.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.360
Mandros ship shantlers.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.360
The guy who had Mandros, now he has a ship shantlers in London.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:57.360
So I contacted him and he actually sent me quite a lot of photos from his old shop.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.360
He sent me five or six different photos.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.360
Because that was one of the last that's been...

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.360
Yes, they all moved to London.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.360
The Kolakis as well.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.920
Yes.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.920
Most of these people lived in Bari.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.920
That's where they resided.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.920
Their businesses were down the bay, but they lived.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.920
Their residence was in Bari.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:25.920
So all Bari people, well, Nisiotis, stayed in Bari at the time when the port was in its heyday of course.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.920
Who else was there?

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.920
Yes.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.920
Kalamatousides.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480
Kalamatousides.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.480
They're still growing very strong.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.480
Big supporters of the church to this day.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.480
Is there any way that I can contact him, this family, so if they have any old pictures?

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.480
Kalamatousides, his father's got all the information.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.480
He's got contact numbers and he's in contact with them quite a lot.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.480
And the Kolakis.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.480
He's been in contact with them most recently.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.480
He sent us a donation to the North Kolakis.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:11.040
So he has a lot of information that you could, they would have, they would have ample material that you could use.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.040
There was mainly photos.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.040
Yes.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.040
Because of the religious nature.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.040
Yes, so much.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.040
Are there any photographs in that magazine we produced?

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.040
For the 100 years of the church.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.040
There might be.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.040
Have you got that?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.600
I don't have this, but I've seen this here at some point.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.600
No, I think there's some over there.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.600
You might find some photographs of interest there.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.600
There was lots of other.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.600
Sorry.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.600
Any other?

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.600
Ship shandlers.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.600
Any great pictures.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.600
Did they tell you about Lambros?

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:04.160
The big, it was the, well not Cornish, it was the, he was what Wally's is today, the delicatessen.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:12.160
He was the Greek bakaliker of the time in the early, late 40s and 50s all along Butte Street.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.160
And all along the main street in Butte Street there was all Greek houses.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
The old houses where they'd been knocked down completely.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:28.720
All Greek families, which I know the old folk have died and people moved on to America.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.720
And evidently all the buildings have been knocked down.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.720
And then all the way up Butte Street there were all the Lambros.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.280
Yes, it was a cafe, you don't know the cafes.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.280
The Spiros.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.280
The Archbishop.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.280
Where was the church?

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.280
Athanasios, Athanasios.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:31.280
Right here almost, that's just part of the, what's all this here?

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.280
Yes.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.280
The wedding of Mrs. Katerina.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.280
You got married here.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.280
Yes.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.840
Who is this?

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.840
Pate Spiros Dasilas.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.840
He came in 1958.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.840
Who is this?

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.840
Our Antonis.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.840
What's his name?

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.840
Yes, Antonis.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.840
He came in 1958 with Dimitris.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.840
1958.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.840
This is your wedding?

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.840
No.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.400
Yes, yes.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.400
Yes, yes.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.400
We are patriots with the Lambros.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.400
Really?

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.400
Yes.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.400
We are in the neighboring villages.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.400
Really?

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.400
Yes, I know them.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.400
Which village?

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.400
I am in Mousaiki.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.400
How nice.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.960
Pate Spiros, Psalts.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.960
I am in Cyprus.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.960
Prokidis, George.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.960
As you said, do you know who is here in a photo?

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.960
This palikari, who is here, is not the priest.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.960
The teacher.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.960
The teacher.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.960
Ah.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.520
Yes.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.520
We were in the church.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.520
We were in a park.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.520
Yes.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.520
The park was empty.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.520
Yes.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.520
I want to ask you something.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.520
Yes.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.520
When the children are in the park,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.520
they can't go out.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.520
Yes.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.520
What time should we go to the park?

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.520
Well, six.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.080
Six.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.080
We will start from here.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.080
You will take the car.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.080
I should be...

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.080
...five and a half.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.080
We should be six.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.080
Yes, because six and a half starts.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.080
I will take the car.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.080
Okay.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.080
Yes, okay.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.080
There is a parking lot.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.080
Yes.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.080
There is quite a lot of old,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.080
just old photographs here.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.640
Who was that?

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.640
Thomas?

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.640
Thomas?

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.640
Was it Maritsa?

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.640
Yes.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.640
Maritsa.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.640
It might be Papa Thomas,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.640
because Thomas baptized me.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.640
You were born here, ma'am?

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.640
Yes.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.640
During the war.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.640
My father traveled and was found here.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.640
My mother and my brothers.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.640
They were born here.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.640
And they came here

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.640
to see me.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.640
And I was born in 1942.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.640
What is your father's name?

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.640
Baboula.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.640
My mother is Kostala.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.640
Kostala and Baboula.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.640
Okay.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.200
So,

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.200
it was

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.200
the shop of Lambrou.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.200
Lambrou.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.200
Maroukou.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.200
Maroukou.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.200
And the cafe.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.200
The cafe where

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.200
everyone was standing.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.200
But there were others

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.200
who had cafes.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.200
I don't remember who the others were.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.200
All in one row.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.200
All in one row.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.760
The old opera house.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.760
The Radisson Blue.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.760
All of the Radisson Blue.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.760
All of the corners

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.760
where you took the corner

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.760
and came down from the bridge.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.760
All of that was the cafe.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.760
Yes.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.760
All of that row was cafes.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.760
The cafe was Maroukou.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.760
I don't remember

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.760
what it was called.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.760
Hiotissa was Maroukou.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.760
I don't think so.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.320
There were others.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.320
We are young children

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.320
of that era.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.320
We didn't have hearing.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.320
We were coming to church

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.320
and it was No Man's Land.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.320
The streets of houses

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.320
here were

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.320
houses.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.320
Yes, houses.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.320
Yes, houses.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.320
Here, at the same time,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.320
where the English school is now,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.320
there was a river.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.880
Yes.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.880
It was a very interesting area.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.880
It was called Iskanao.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.880
Yes.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.880
It was side streets.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.880
We are coming from this side

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.880
for the church.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.880
A completely different layout

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.880
and everything here is very different.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.880
I don't know.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.880
There will be something here in the old days.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.880
Yes.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.880
Photographs.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.880
I am looking for

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.440
the Katei Heritage Center.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.440
There are many.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.440
I have found photos of the area.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.440
I can't find photos from this corner

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.440
with the Greek shops.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.440
I found only one.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.440
I will show you now.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.440
Because you may not remember.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.440
I would remember in peace.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.440
My sister Nana is the one

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.440
who has the greatest memory.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.440
Yes.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.440
We will talk about her later.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.440
Yes, she is a priest.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
No, she was here last Friday.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
But she may be here for the next 10 minutes.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
One quarter.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I will show you something.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Take a look.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We will take it.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
How will we take it?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
How will we go in this corner?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
We have a small car.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I will show you.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I have to see what I have.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I found some photos of an old fountain.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I found some photos

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
from the Greek cafes inside.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Aha.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
But I haven't found any from outside.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Shh.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
I have a photo collection.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I will show you.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I have an old laptop.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I will take a photo.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
This is Ioannis Kisanis.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
We have Kisanis in the house of the Swarovski.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Yes.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I remember the photo.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Yes.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
This corner.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
This is the corner of the church.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Yes.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Maroukos was on this side.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
That way.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
This is the other end.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.560
This is the other end, isn't it?

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.560
Yes.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.560
That's the church during the war.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.560
Good Lord.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.560
Good God.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.560
From the interior of the cafe.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.560
Yes, from the interior of the cafe.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.560
I don't know.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.560
I need to read.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.560
It says here that it is from the war.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.560
It says here that it is from the war.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.120
It says here that it is from the war.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.120
I don't know.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.120
Cafe of restaurants.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.120
Cafe of restaurants.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.120
But it doesn't say anything.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.120
I don't know.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.120
That's 40s.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.120
The one Sophia's cafe was.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.120
Yes.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.120
It was Sophia.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.680
Ullandredes.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.680
Of course.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.680
This left.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.680
Chipshandlers.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.680
Down the bottom.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.680
Just at the bottom of Butte Street.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.680
Just as you approach.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.680
Just as you approach.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.680
The lights.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.680
The traffic light.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.680
Where Asprey's building is today.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.680
Yes.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.680
But I think it was on the other side, was it not?

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.680
Ullandredes.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.680
Where Asprey's building was.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.680
It wasn't there.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.680
It wasn't on that side, was it?

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.680
There was Corrie's there.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.680
Corrie's.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.680
Angleys.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.680
Angleys, yes.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.680
Very famous.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.680
The family of Corrie's.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.680
How did they call him?

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.680
Argyros.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.680
Do you remember?

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.680
Argyros.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.680
I don't remember.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.240
I remember.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.240
Captain Ullandredes.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.240
All those heroes.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.240
I remember.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.240
And Margarita.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.240
And now.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.240
Michalis Argyros.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.240
Yes.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.240
And there was another hat.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.240
Kubara would remember much better.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.240
All of these are from this, Ioannis Kisani's.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.240
Oh, Dukas.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.800
That was another one.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.800
Dukas.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.800
We had Dukas in various worlds, didn't we?

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.800
I also may have some.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.800
Sorry.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.800
Close it before you go there.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.800
Find it again.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.360
You don't remember the writing of Vergotis.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.360
It was closed before the war.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.360
I don't remember that.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.360
Except for the bar,

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.360
there were Greek bakalikas.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.360
Many.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.360
Very many.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.360
Café, bakalika.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.360
At Dockview Road.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.360
Thompson Street.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.360
Thompson Street.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.920
Do you remember who had what?

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.920
It was...

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.920
Mr. Dimitris didn't have bakalikas at the bar.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.920
No, at the cart.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.920
At the cart.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.920
My mother had.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.920
Mrs. Katerina's mother had.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.920
At the bar.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.920
The 50s.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.920
Up into Dockview Road.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.920
We don't have.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.920
Dimitris Lantzos...

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.480
He had grocery stores.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.480
In Cardiff.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.480
In the 60s.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.480
70s.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.480
In McIntosh Place.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.480
McIntosh Place.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.480
In Routh.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.480
What was that?

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.480
King's Stores.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.480
In Canton, yes.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.480
In 7 Road.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.480
7 Road.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.480
What can this be?

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.040
McIntosh Place.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.040
What was that?

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.040
This newspaper, which I can't find now,

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.040
has published all the births and baptisms in Cardiff.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.040
That's wonderful.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.040
Wonderful.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.040
60s also.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.040
60s.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.040
Yes.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.040
Do you remember this commentator?

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.600
Oh, that's the other one, Logothetis.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.600
No.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.600
No, I don't remember.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.600
Was he in Kalinikos' time?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.600
Logothetis.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.600
I don't remember them, Katerina.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.600
He was in prison, I remember.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.600
He was in prison.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.600
Yes.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.600
That time was very little.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.600
In the early 60s.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.600
60s.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.160
Yes, so early 60s.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.160
Wish we could help.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.160
No, no, you're helping much.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.160
Yes, I think.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.160
Yes.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.160
Yes.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.160
That's too new for me.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.160
I remembered the pizza.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.160
And Pyrmanes.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.160
Pyrmanes, yes.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.160
The family name was Kalamotous.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.160
Kalamotous, the same name.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.160
Yes.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.160
Lots of families from here.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.160
Yes.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:18.160
If you have any old photos, I would happily take a picture of them and put them in my cards.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.720
If you've got any old photos of people doing things.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.720
It doesn't matter to be business.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.720
It's just a gathering.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.720
First liberation.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.720
Okay.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.720
We've got plenty of those.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.720
Books everywhere.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.720
You can have a look at them and bring them in and choose what you want to see.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.720
I can photograph them for now.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.720
And then we'll show them out later.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.720
Because you know how it is.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.720
My job is usually collecting everything.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.280
And then thinking afterwards.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.280
Yes.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.280
Have you got a time limit to do this?

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.280
We should produce something by the end of March next year.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.280
That's our end time.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.280
And we'll see.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.280
End of Katarina's London Marathon Agiotti's interview.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.280
So we'll see.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.840
And they used to send me to the coal exchange to take contracts like you say.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.840
And take the mail.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.840
But it was not posted or emails in those days.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.840
The office girl, you just walked it.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.840
And it could have been ten times a day.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.840
But you had to take paperwork to exchange views and messages.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.840
And that's how the system worked.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.840
Yes.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.840
And I was very happy to see that.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.840
And I was very happy to see that.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.840
And I was very happy to see that.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.840
And I was very happy to see that.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.400
And that's how the system worked.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.400
But I remember it was buzzing.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.400
I can picture it now.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.400
And it was such a young girl myself just starting out.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.400
And overwhelming.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.400
Overwhelming with the amount of business and people exchanging lots of money.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.400
Fantastic.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.400
So he might have some information.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.400
Yes, he might help you.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.400
We might be able to help you.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.400
He's a very good person.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.400
And he's very good at it.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.400
And he's very good at it.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.400
And he's very good at it.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.960
So I need to say something.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.960
Actually, that's why we said we were going to do that.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.960
When we applied for this.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.960
That would be great.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.960
Like a small exhibition of people's photos.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.960
And organize it in the case of fundraising event.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.960
So, yeah, that's the reason we're asking for photos.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.960
So, yeah, that's the reason we're asking for photos.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.960
But I'm having to cut it.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.960
We'll look it up.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.960
We'll see if we can track something down.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.960
Yes.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.960
After this weekend we can look at Fr. Spiro.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.960
Mrs. Galimikos.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.960
Mrs. Viterra. Mrs. Williams.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.960
Mrs. Williams. She was Greek but married to a Welshman.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.960
Mrs. Viterra. Who's that? You?

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.960
No. Who's that? Me.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.960
That's you.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.960
Stasas? Stasas. No.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.960
I can't see upside down.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.960
Look at all the blackboard.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.960
Good well being. Stasas.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.960
Stasas. Good. All right.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.960
You have to hear.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.960
I did see them earlier.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.960
They're somewhere there.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.960
Here they are.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.960
Father Salabata. Here.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.960
There's some Galimikos.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.960
And all the... I think they've all gone, haven't they?

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.960
I can't see how they've all gone.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.960
All have gone.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.960
And many from here.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.960
The ladies.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.960
Yes.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.960
Thank you very much. I want to tire you out.
