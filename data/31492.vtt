00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
But terrible place for water.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.480
Oh Lord, I've seen the water going in there, terrible.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.120
Oh, heaven's sake.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.840
I went down, I was the first to lower the coal-cutting machine down at Brom.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.720
And the man said to me, when you come down after nurse, you'll go.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.160
So I could walk down, he said, just 14 inches in the yard slope.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.000
So you were 14 inches deeper there than you were at the first yard, you know, a yard road.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.080
So I walked down now and I said, well, well, well.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.600
There was a voice, they were trying to get this wind thing off.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.520
Sheets were going to get in there now, that are propped up against the top.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.280
When the water was coming down on them, and they were laying it, they were laying it like ducks.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.080
And the water was running in here through the neck of their shirt, and was running out through the leg of their clothes.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.080
In the river.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.360
Now there was a state to the man.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.480
It was, it was so wet.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.680
I'd been coming home with a man on a frosty morning.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.480
On the push bike.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880
Going up across, Kingsborough coming, now you come that way today.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.880
We were making this new roundabout and you'd only be able to come that way from Brom.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.120
This fellow living in Saundersfoot, and we'd be coming along peddling.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.800
Hard frost, freezing.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.800
And all of a sudden, a couple of ones said, and his leg would go to him.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.800
He was frozen on his legs.
