00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
You moved to Devanna when you were about 14, 15, did you say? A bit older?

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.080
No, no, I never lived here as a child.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.080
Oh, okay.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.880
We just spent a lot of time here because of family.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.400
Just what, like you did?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.840
Yeah, yeah, but no, I lived in St Harmon and then when I moved to Nottingham to study further education,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:33.440
the first term I came back, it was 1986, so I went in September, came back in for Christmas.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:43.840
I was away for the whole 12 weeks and my uncle died. My uncle died just after I got back

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.680
and he was the sole occupier at that time of Devanna. He didn't marry my uncle Jack,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.760
he was the eldest one of all the boys. My father was the youngest one of all the boys,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.920
so it was about 20 years between my father and my uncle Jack. He died and the house was empty for a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.920
year and it was, what should we do? Nobody wanted, because it was such a centre, the centre of the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:19.680
family and the family, it's sort of, we were all over the place, but nobody wanted it to be sold.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.000
I mean, I'm talking about the next generation above, they were sort of like deciding what to do.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.560
So in the end, my parents moved in, so they moved in while I was studying in Nottingham.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.280
And so then it was only when I moved back, I was in Nottingham about seven years,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.840
and it was only when I moved back that I moved into Devanna. That's the first time I'd actually

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.920
lived there. And I got, because I'd got, I started working in Herefordshire, so I'd be driving to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.320
Leicester every day from here, which was doable. And my plan was to, you know, find somewhere a

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.720
bit nearer to live, but it never really happened. And then I met Jake, who was already living in

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:08.960
Abercombe here, next to the church at Cross Cottage. And he was working in Kidderminster,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.960
so we ended up just renting little places in between Lentster and Kidderminster.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.480
And then we got married and, you know, moved to Kidderminster, moved to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.480
North Staffordshire, moved to Leic with his work, and the little boys, our children came along.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.760
But we, every weekend, we still came back to Abercombe here, even though, even though we were,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.920
it was a hundred miles to drive to Leic, we'd be coming back on a Friday evening. We'd pick the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.280
boys up from school, or one of them, because they were only very tiny. And so we did that for a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:01.040
couple of years. And then when my father died, we moved back. We just, you know, Jake gave up his

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:09.680
job. We put the house on the market up there and moved back. And then we'd been here about, I don't

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.600
know, a few months, six months, eight months, something like that. And we moved into Little

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.720
Plot because Dad had built it to retire into. And of course he died at age 64, hadn't retired yet.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.080
The house was sitting there empty, so we moved in. The boys needed somewhere a bit bigger to play.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.280
And there's lots of space here, and we were closer to Mum to offer a bit of support.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.400
It was, it had already been renovated, Little Plot, then?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.760
Yeah.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.480
When you moved in.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.120
Yeah. Well, it was a new build. It was, it's on the footprint of an old barn.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.240
Oh, okay.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:55.440
And funnily enough, my cousin sent me some old photographs a couple of weeks ago. And one of

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.280
them is of Devanor Yard. And the only reason I recognised it as being Devanor Yard was because

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.160
of the, there's like a concrete feeding trough, which was for the horses and the cows in the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.280
yard. And I recognised that because the barn that this, you know, on this site was actually

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.320
in Devanor Yard. And it was called the French Barn. And they decided they wanted a bigger building.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.960
So they moved this barn, which was a wooden barn. They moved it into the field called Little Plot.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.560
And all the brothers did it. And it must have been the late 60s to make room for the sort of

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.880
modern farm building barn that they put there.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.400
Wow.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.480
So this was the French Barn. It had been here since the late 60s, but it had been, you know,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.840
it was a much older, it was a very old building because it had been somewhere else prior to that.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:12.160
It had been in Devanor Yard. And it wasn't really renovatable. So we built something new based on

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.600
the footprint, or my father did, based on the footprint of the barn and built it to look barn

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.240
like so that it blended in. So that was the plan.
