00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
Vicki Macdonald, Holy Trinity Church during the longest yarn.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:13.040
Wendy has remembered some more things about her family, a number of uncles who all were

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.000
very involved in the war and who survived.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.400
Wendy tell me about them.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:27.680
So I had one uncle in the convoys going up to Russia and then another one who was in

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:37.080
the African rifles, another in the Mediterranean as a sailor, and then the one, the youngest

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.600
one was in the submarines and he'd volunteered to go and he was only 17 and he said he was

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:52.720
18 I think or he was 16 and when he was sent out to the Far East, the Japanese were bombing

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.840
the submarines and they had to pretend that they were hit and they had to throw out their

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.320
valuables overboard to give the impression that they'd been hit and I remember my mother

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.840
being very annoyed because something, a present she'd given him was thrown overboard and another

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.120
one was in the, I have one, two, three African rifles, I think that was it really.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.360
So Wendy were they, they were brothers or were they?

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.240
They were all brothers, five brothers.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:34.200
Five brothers and my grandmother was dying of cancer and in 1944 she died and the, what's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.640
the name of the service, they managed to get all the brothers home in time for the funeral.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.640
For their mother's funeral.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.640
For their mother's funeral.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.920
I don't know how they managed it, yes.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.200
And they all survived the war?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.720
They all survived the war.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.120
She must have been absolutely devastated when all five of them were at war together.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.120
Yes, but they survived.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.120
They survived and she didn't know that they survived.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.120
No.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.120
Oh gosh.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.120
No.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.120
That is amazing isn't it?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.240
I went to the funeral, I was taken to the funeral in 1944.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.160
Oh thank you Wendy, that's a lovely addition, thank you so much.
