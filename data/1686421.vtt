WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Firstly on behalf of HDA let me say thank you to Heritage Lottery for giving us the

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.720
support we needed to deliver this series of podcasts about Tiger Bay.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:26.800
And let me also say anything we say on here is not the responsibility or the opinion of

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.800
Heritage Lottery.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.520
It's a community project and the community has a right to a voice and that is hopefully

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.400
what we're capturing.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.000
But all of the podcasts will remain and we'll move to the People's Collection for Wales

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.360
at the end of this work.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.000
They will remain live on the podcast for at least another nine months.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.600
But the podcasts are intended to give you an idea of the people, the community, the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.480
village that was Tiger Bay, Butetown, whatever you wanted to call it.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:18.520
But it was a village of real people who worked really hard, who lived and died for Wales

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.840
in many, many regards.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.520
They were all races, they were all faiths, they were all languages.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.200
And any of the stories or any of the oral histories you've heard on here will continually

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:42.480
say about how they lived together in unity, shared each other's religious festivals,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.080
each other's homes, each other's food.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.160
However, that wasn't the case outside of the bay.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.720
The rest of society, despite the contribution made in the First World War, which of course

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.880
as we said was followed by race riots against the people and later race riots against the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.760
Chinese, despite that.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:22.160
In the wars, people experienced overt racism and a policy that was never totally encapsulated

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.760
in law but became a reality.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.920
Now I'm going to read you a few passages from a book by a man who I really wish we'd been

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.880
able to include in these podcasts.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:50.840
Not simply because he was one of the few people who put pen to paper and put it in a couple

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:59.720
of really good books about Tiger Bay, but also because it's a terrible shame that he's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.760
not with us anymore.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:13.760
That man was Neil M.C. Sinclair who wrote the Tiger Bay story and a follow-up book called

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.040
Endangered Tiger, a Community Under Threat.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:28.200
And few people knew more about the bay than Neil Sinclair.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:38.040
Now the press attacked the people of Tiger Bay, generally with things they made up about

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.400
prostitution, about crimes, none of which was supported by any evidence.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.760
But there wasn't, as far as I'm aware, a press complaints body then and anyway who would

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.560
have listened to the complaints from the residents of Tiger Bay.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.600
But there was also a colour bar.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.120
Now that's not mentioned much and you certainly won't see people talking about it generally

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.200
within society now, however it existed.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:23.760
So let me read you an excerpt from someone who knew and who's, well, I value his opinion

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.760
immensely.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.360
That's Neil Sinclair and this is from the Tiger Bay story.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.240
In July of 1935 the following was published in the Western Mail.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.040
Quote, hundreds of Arab and coloured seamen have settled in the city.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.360
They construct their own places of worship.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:52.880
They mate with the type of women who are willing to accept them because there are none of their

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.840
own kind to be hailed.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.040
The coloured men who have come to dwell in our cities are being made to adopt the standards

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.360
civilisation they cannot be expected to understand.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.160
There is no reason for sentimentality in this matter.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.520
Let him who pleads the justice of the coloured man's settlement among us read the report's

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.840
references to venereal disease and the heavy toll of tuberculosis among our guests.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.240
Many of them are citizens of the British Empire.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.920
Many did fine work in the war.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.720
Neither of these considerations should blind us to the plain fact they do not belong to

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:43.400
the social system we have evolved in these islands.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.840
Despite the work of my grandmother, that's Neil Sinclair's grandmother, Agnes Headley,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.760
she was merely one of the type of women who were willing to accept a black man and in

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:05.200
that system her daughter Beatrice was referred to as a, in quotes, half-caste.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.240
Now at a time before my brother Leonard died, Beatrice and her best friend Katie Nathan,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:19.000
two in quotes half-caste girls, decided on a day out uptown.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.880
Let me explain here, uptown is outside the bay.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.960
They put on their best clothes to go.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.440
Of course Leonard, who wasn't quite two, had to be taken along.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.080
There was rarely the convenience of babysitters back then in the 1930s, so babies were dressed

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.560
up and taken too.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.700
Having spent a busy afternoon window shopping and otherwise enjoying themselves, the thought

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.640
of a nice cup of tea easily sprang to mind.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.360
So they stopped at an Italian cafe in St Mary Street called Rabiotti.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.880
They sat and they sat as waitresses continued to serve other customers who came in after

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:07.040
them so Beatrice called for the manager who promptly informed them that people like them

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.120
could not be served there.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.120
Beatrice protested.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.880
She and her friends were tired and not leaving until they were served.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:26.320
Here we have a mother, a child and a friend, all born in Wales, being made to adopt a standard

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.400
of civilisation they cannot be expected to understand.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.880
They were politely escorted from the premises by a policeman the manager had contacted outside

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.720
in St Mary Street.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:48.480
The policeman explained it was the proprietor's prerogative if he chose not to serve them.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.520
So in disgrace and indignation they went without their tea.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.920
This apparently was the enforcement of the policy that declared that people like Beatrice,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:06.240
Katie and poor little Leonard did not belong to the social system we have evolved in these

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.320
islands.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:16.440
To maintain its barriers the aforementioned social system forged a nomenclature half-caste

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:25.160
out of British experience as a dominating empire with its attendant colonial regime.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:31.560
Here we have a standard of civilisation that refuses to accept the children it has made.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.880
The term half-caste is still used today in the media but it is not heard so much in Tiger

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:43.560
Bay as it was up to the black conscious movement of the 1960s.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.680
Half-caste was a word I tended to hear more when I left the bay to go to school in Bute

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.680
Terrace.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.760
Pupils there from other parts of Cardiff more than once said to me, you're half-caste,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.760
ain't you?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.800
Causually I say, yeah, like after all what is it to you?

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.680
Then with my admission would come, well is your mother white?

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.420
No, I say.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.500
So your father's white then?

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.540
No, again was the reply.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.500
Both my parents are half-caste.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.500
Naturally, I personally could not feel comfortable with such a designation.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.580
After all, who is cast into this world?

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:28.820
I was born, my parents were born, if labels must be placed, why half-caste that reached?

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:35.220
That rather oddball term derived from a European colonialism and misguiding antiquated racialist

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.500
philosophy about the alleged division of humanity.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:45.140
There is no need for the continued usage of such an undignified term as half-caste.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:52.540
It should be replaced by the complementary terms of Afro-Celtic, Afro-Saxon, Indio-Cumric.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:58.060
These terms better represent our place in the capital city of modern Wales.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:03.020
Which is why I began this story by praising the land of my mothers rather than with the

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:08.700
land of my fathers to traditional opening line of the Welsh National Anthem.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:18.860
Evidence exists to indicate this is not the first time we graced these shores.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:24.780
Celtic heritage aside, when a person from Tiger Bay fills out an application for a job

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:30.500
that includes an ethnic breakdown, he or she can, for all intents and purposes, practically

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.860
say yes to every designated group.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:39.900
This phenomenon indicates that time is long overdue for those born in Wales and with a

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:45.220
Welsh matriarchal lineage to be recognised as Celtic and for those with obvious African

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.400
features to be recognised as Afro-Celtic.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.300
This determination could go without saying for the Indians, Malays, Arabs and all the

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.180
different nationalities that settled old Tiger Bay.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:02.420
And of course by extension for all ethnically intermixed communities throughout the rest

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:09.260
of Britain, more assuredly for those of second and third generation.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.620
An end must be brought once and for all to the lack of acceptance implied in the term

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.660
half-caste.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.380
We are Welsh.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:21.420
Everything that happened to us prior to and throughout this century occurred in Wales.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:29.340
We are an indelible and recognisable part of Welsh history.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.260
With what had been said before, St Mary Street was becoming off limits to people of colour,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.700
despite its close proximity to target Tiger Bay and the fact that at the time the statue

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:47.820
of Marquis Bute facing the direction of his beloved Docs, it's now located in Callaghan

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.180
Street, Callaghan Square.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:56.220
Opposite the Italian cafe in St Mary Street, which denied service to people of colour,

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:02.580
was the Pavilion Cinema, where Black Bow and their white lady friends spent many an evening

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.580
at the pictures.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.780
However, this story isn't all one-sided.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.900
White gents escorted their brown maidens too.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.020
It must be recalled Mr Blackman, a not so tall white gentleman, came down to Moriah

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.820
Street, smartly dressed, with his raincoat neatly placed over his right arm to call upon

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.500
his dark Venus.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.700
He stood in front of the door and knocked, and when Lydia Hopkins opened the door, there

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.460
he stood ready to take her to the pavilion.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.940
We can't go there, she said.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.500
They're not letting black folks in any more.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:42.420
Auntie Annie Gordon couldn't go there with her black bloat either, which what was there

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.720
to do?

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:52.000
It was then, during the 1930s, that everyone down the bay began to go to the Central Cinema

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.520
on the Hayes, starting a tradition that was to continue until the 50s.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:08.720
The Pavilion Cinema, which once banned interracial couples in the 1930s, in the 1950s, was now

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:15.520
to be shook, rattled and rolled by the black American music of Joe Turner, who appeared

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.160
in the movie Rock Around the Clock, singing the original version of Shake, Rattle and

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:27.040
Roll, a song which was sung subsequently by Bill Haley and the Comets and various other

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.280
white American and British artists.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.640
The invasion of rhythm and blues and rock and roll were taking place as Cardiff Planets

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.800
were planning the destruction and uprooting of Tiger Bay.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:49.720
As I've said, that was an extract from a book I recommend, The Tiger Bay Story by Neil Sinclair.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:55.480
So the Colour Bar, as we know, as everybody knows, existed.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:03.560
I say everybody, I mean everybody who's black, mixed-raced or of a generation, let's say.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.920
May not be in the minds of an 18 or 30 year old, but it's certainly in the minds of those

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.760
who are much older.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:23.960
So in the 1930s, the people were good enough to crew the merchant ships, work the docks,

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:34.120
be visited by the people of uptown, white people.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:40.120
They could visit the docks, but the docks were not allowed to visit them.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:47.640
So it's important to understand why people might feel resentment, but it's important

00:14:47.640 --> 00:15:00.200
to understand too that the Second World War started in the 1930s and it didn't stop those

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:10.760
in quotes, half-caste people for joining the ships, joining the army, being a part of that

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:22.440
war for a country that they were born in and yet would not even allow them a cup of tea

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:33.480
in its tea bars or restaurants, or allow them to go to some of its cinemas.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:45.160
So all I would say here is this is history, this is reality, the experience of people

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.680
from Tiger Bay.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:55.640
What is important is how they handled that experience, what it meant to them in the long

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.720
run.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:05.960
And in the long run, despite attempted repatriation after World War I and after World War II,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:13.800
despite not being able to be considered or seen as equal citizens in between the wars,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:22.280
despite having their homes destroyed and their community ripped apart in the 60s,

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.680
they're still here.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:35.000
Their children are still representing Wales at rugby and football and boxing for Wales and

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.320
competing in athletics for Wales.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:53.400
So I guess the comment made by my uncle when I was a child actually has more meaning now.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:03.720
And it is we came here, we stayed here, we're not going anywhere.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.520
This is our country.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:13.320
Now this is merely other than the reading from Neil Sinclair, it's merely my opinion,

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:21.800
not HDAs, but I think it's important to actually understand people.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:35.400
You might say quite reasonably that history, and it was terrible that that history

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.680
made people of an older generation feel like that.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:49.480
Well, HDA conducted a piece of research recently, very recently, we're talking last few months,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
for the Welsh Government.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.880
And these are a couple of the, a few of the headlines from that research.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.520
Research.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.640
People felt discrimination was the most significant factor about being unemployed

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.560
and their treatment when employed.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:21.320
Let me say this was targeted towards Butetown and those of mixed race or their white parents.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.720
Most respondents, whether born in Wales or not, saw themselves as Welsh.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:36.760
However, half of them, very nearly 50%, I should say, did not feel the rest of society

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.000
sees them as being Welsh.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.760
Now 64% of the respondents were born in Wales.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:54.840
So, it may well be that things have changed, but it is certainly true that a large number of people

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:03.960
don't believe that change is either happening quick enough or is benefiting them.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:13.160
And they still believe that society in Cardiff, the people uptown, don't want them.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:28.520
So, if you're having a cup of coffee, or a drink, or a meal in the bars or restaurants on Cardiff,

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.800
as it was once, think about it this way.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.320
Uptown has come to the bay.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:44.440
To do that, it had to knock down half of the village, the community that was Tiger Bay.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:53.640
Maybe you'd like to look at the history of the community, the people that were in the

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.760
was Tiger Bay.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.800
Maybe you'd like to look around and ask a question.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:09.000
How many of the people that served you, work there, etc., are actually from Bute Town?

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.440
This is, after all, walking distance from where they live.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.960
And much of what we're talking about here is historical.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:30.200
But that isn't.
