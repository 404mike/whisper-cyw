00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Music

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Honoring God, I feel a pleasure,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
When we reach His world so close.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Give to me a heart made happy,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The endless pure gold.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
How we guard our golden goodness,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
There and at the living right.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Come, we are forever singing,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Singing through the day and night.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Give to me a heart made happy,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The endless pure gold.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
How we guard our golden goodness,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There and at the living right.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Come, we are forever singing,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Singing through the day and night.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Give to me a heart made happy,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
There and at the living right.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Come, we are forever singing,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Singing through the day and night.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
How we guard our golden goodness,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
There and at the living right.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Come, we are forever singing,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Singing through the day and night.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Give to me a heart made happy,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There and at the living right.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Come, we are forever singing,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Singing through the day and night.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Come, we are forever singing,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Singing through the day and night.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
