I think these tragedies that are shown now on television, what we see is always much more vivid than what we hear and what we read.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You've only got to show a child a picture and it stays. You can tell them to read a book or do something like that, but it doesn't stay quite the same way, unless they've got a very good imagination.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But anybody looking at a picture and it stays with you. And the impact of television on Abba Van was terrific.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In the same way that you've got it now in Japan and the tsunami and things like that, that is staying in people's minds.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Do you think it's possible in those kinds of circumstances for television to convey how people are feeling?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I think you have to be very careful. Television commentators tend to interview people, you know, and ask.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And when people suddenly have questions thrust at them, they say what they think they ought to say.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
They don't always think, you know, instinctively, oh, I'm on television, I better say something.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You know, I can't say what I want to say. I can't swear, you know.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I mean, I can't say all the language I want to burst out at the NCB because of Abba Van, because I'm on television.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It doesn't come over very well. But I find it can be an artificial.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Very rarely do you get a sort of immediate impact reaction. It's a more studied one.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If you approach somebody with a camera or a microphone, they sort of dither. They don't quite know what to do.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I think it needs a very good producer or director, whatever it is, to pick the right moment and the right person.
