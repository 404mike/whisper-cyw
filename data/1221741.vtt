00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
If you read Danny's books, you'll see that my dad was supposed to be the most moderate of the lefty-ness,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.200
but none of them were anywhere near Tories.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.840
And in my family growing up, my dad, it did.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:22.080
I mean, in the sense that my dad was in the army from, you know, 42 to 46,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.200
and the war had massive impression on him.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.120
I remember him talking to Holda's husband, Marcel, when I was growing up about, you know,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.720
just little memories about being in the tube or being in the shelter.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.040
My dad, for instance, was in some place in the war, and he went to the bus stop,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.320
and he'd forgotten something, you know, an air raid, the bus stop's a crater.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.200
It made him like, he had a sort of realpolitik about things,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.440
but he couldn't believe how badly it was bungled, and he was definitely against wars,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.120
particularly the Vietnam War was huge.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.320
And he was friends and an advisor to George McGovern, who was, I mean, when I was growing,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.320
my dad taught in North Carolina, Virginia, and the District of Columbia,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.600
and we frequently, we had meals with the McGoverns,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.440
and he was advising them during the 72 campaign, you know,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.200
and so he was quite a left-wing politician for America.
