00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
And since you've been in Wales, do you feel that you've made friends here?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.600
No.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.040
Not at all.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.560
I'm finding it really difficult.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.640
I'm finding it difficult because

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.840
there's not a lot of people that

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.960
are exactly like me.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.080
And

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.680
it's hard to pick and choose who you want to be friends with.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.400
And I'm one of those people who

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.840
who I can just see a person and I'll know there and then

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.040
if I'm going to get on with that person or not.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.640
And you feel that since you've been here, you've not met?

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.720
I haven't met anyone like myself.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.840
If I could have another double of me,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.360
I'd be the happiest person on the planet.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.200
I wish I could just be able to pick the phone up

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.880
and speak to someone and say, do you want to meet up

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.240
for coffee, for lunch, just to do something with,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.960
just to do something.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.160
But I am finding it really, really difficult

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.640
because I find being here, everyone's got their own lives.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.040
And back in South Africa,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.880
you can just pick up the phone in the morning, say, do you want to come spend a day together?

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.920
And they're there.
