T

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
While a rose, see the twelfth year's glow of myre,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Our right wing, the young and choir,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Were impressed in my dream,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Were impressed in my dream.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Silent night, holy night,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000
All is calm, all is right,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Round yon virgin, mother and child,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Holy infant so tender and mild,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Sleep in heavenly peace,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Sleep in heavenly peace.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Silent night, holy night,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Son of God, last your life,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Radiant peace from thy holy face,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
With the dawn of redeeming grace,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Jesus, Lord at thy birth,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Jesus, Lord at thy birth.
